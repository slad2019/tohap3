<p><strong>Q:</strong>  Can you please say something about those two Americans who came with a letter and gift from President Roosevelt for the Dalai Lama, and the Dalai Lama returned a letter and a gift, can you tell me some more details about that?   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  I remember that these people came and that they brought gifts, and that the gifts were replied to but were they talked about, I really don&apos;t know. What do you actually want to know about that?   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  Wasn&apos;t it in the period of World War II in which they wanted to use the road? Wasn&apos;t that the period?   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  I remember that they discussed that matter at the tsondu (Assembly), but they decided not to give them use of the road. They were scared that when they let them use the road, this would be fully used as military transportation and Tibet would become a kind of military passage and that would create problems. Secondly, if you allowed them to use the road for military transportations, then you would be allied with someone and it wouldn&apos;t show that actually you were staying in neutral [Tib. &#xF56;&#xF62;&#xF0B;&#xF42;&#xF53;&#xF66;]. Our non-allied status would be damaged. Therefore, it was decided to not give permission for military transportation to be sent through Tibet.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  Around this time, the government of Tibet must have been consulting the British government very much about their policies.   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  As far as foreign relations were concerned, they were consulting the British a little bit.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  Why were they were consulting the British?   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  It was a continuation of the idea of the 13th Dalai Lama to consult the British. Secondly, at that time, when you consulted the British, they could give you something more than what the Tibetans knew because they were much more informed about the world situation than the Tibetans. The Tibetan understanding of the world was very poor, so we knew very little.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  Wasn&apos;t there any system like the Tibetans could listen to the radio, the news, to try to understand anything?   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  Not much. They didn&apos;t listen much to the news etc.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  Wasn&apos;t there any broadcasting in the Tibetan language at that time?   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  Yes, Lhalung Lobsang Ph&#xFC;ntso [Tib. &#xF63;&#xFB7;&#xF0B;&#xF63;&#xF74;&#xF44;&#xF0B;&#xF56;&#xFB3;&#xF7C;&#xF0B;&#xF56;&#xF5F;&#xF44;&#xF0B;&#xF55;&#xF74;&#xF53;&#xF0B;&#xF5A;&#xF7C;&#xF42;&#xF66;] was there .   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  It was 1941, was Lobsang Ph&#xFC;ntso there?   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  He was probably not there, but they had a few radios in Tibet.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  At this time, either Ringgang [Tib. &#xF62;&#xF72;&#xF53;&#xF0B;&#xF66;&#xF92;&#xF44;] or somebody suggested in the tsondu.   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  Do you mean the fatty fourth rank?   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  The one who was educated in England.   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  This was Chang&#xF6;ba [Tib. &#xF56;&#xFB1;&#xF0B;&#xF51;&#xF44;&#xF7C;&#xF66;&#xF0B;&#xF54;] and Ringang, and they were brothers from the same parents.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  If so, Chang&#xF6;ba might have incited him to make the suggestion. Was Chang&#xF6;ba&#x2019;s rank higher?   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  They were the same rank.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  Anyway, the point suggested was that even if we had good relations with and took advice from the British, the British didn&apos;t help us that much, so why don&apos;t we built up a really good relationship with the Japanese. Later, they regarded this suggestion as a joke and made it basically disappear. Do you know anything about this and can you say something about it?   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  Usually, Ringgang was not that attentive to politics. He had no such interest. He enjoyed playing mahjong and to run the Agriculture Office, the Sonam Legung [Tib. &#xF66;&#xF7C;&#xF0B;&#xF53;&#xF58;&#xF0B;&#xF63;&#xF66;&#xF0B;&#xF41;&#xF74;&#xF44;&#xF66;]. He was not the sort of person to be involved in any policy, especially not in foreign policy. Things like that he didn&apos;t do. But his brother was Chang&#xF6;ba, who was one of the governments officials who was educated in the west. It could have been Chang&#xF6;ba, but I have no idea.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  It was not the present Chang&#xF6;ba, right? He also knew some English.   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  It was his father. This Chang&#xF6;ba might know a little bit of English taught by his father, but he didn&apos;t go to the English school.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  About the time of the passing of the 13th Dalai Lama, the Chinese sent a delegation to offer religious rites.   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  He was called Huang Musung.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  How did he come? I heard that there was a lot talk regarding whether this should be allowed or not. Was such a thing discussed in the tsondu Assembly? Can you tell me a bit more about that?   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  He came through Kham.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  Probably not. Oh! Yes, he came through Kham and he had many palanquins. Furthermore, in the meeting they discussed and many of the government lay officials did not want to allow them to come, but the tsidrung and the monasteries were keen to allow them? Can you remember something more about this?   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  It was said that since they came to make the religious offerings, they could not be stopped. They discussed this and when they said the Chinese were coming, they thought the British would also come and both should be permitted because they had come for religious purposes and for the late Dalai Lama&apos;s rites. They made a policy decision that there was no way they could stop that.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  Huang Musong left a man behind in Lhasa, right?   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  The director, Kong Chuzhang was left.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  Why did he leave him?   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  When Huang Musong came, he made a lot of points of discussion to the Tibetan government. To some of them, although the Tibetan government could have replied, they did not, they sort of kept them hanging on. When they kept them hanging on, they said Kong must be there to continue the discussion, and while he said that Huang came, he had brought wireless equipment and he left it with Kong. Later they showed that he was sort of a Chinese representative.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  I heard that before Kong departed from China, he gave a press statement that he was going to Tibet to establish the office which controlled Tibet, etc. This was supposed to have been published in newspapers in China. Since we had three representatives there, Khendr&#xF6;nlosum, why didn&apos;t they report such a matter to the Tibetan government? What happened?   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  They probably should have reported it, but it was not discussed in the tsondu or anywhere, so most of us didn&apos;t know anything about this.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  If the Khendr&#xF6;nlosum had reported this matter of what came into the newspapers, then how could the Tibetan government allow him to come in and moreover, leave one man behind. Also, when he got back he gave a further press statement stating that they had established an office and a representative was kept there, etc. Moreover, when the British also asked the Tibetans why this representative was there, it was told that they left him to conclude the talks. Didn&apos;t the British establish their office in Lhasa in Dekyilinga too, about that time?   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  Yes.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  How did that happen?   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  As you said, Kong was left there and the Chinese might have announced that in the papers, so also the British officers showed interest to leave a British representative in Lhasa with the same status as was given to the Chinese.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  To whom did the British ask permission to establish an office and to grant the same status?   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  They might have asked the Kashag   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  Are you really sure that they asked the Kashag?   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  They might have.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  Kong was left there and the British also did the same. They were just left without confirming their status or rights.   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  This is impossible.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  It was definitely like this, and then they started throwing parties for each other. They didn&apos;t have documents for setting up the representatives office. At that time, the British left Dzasa Rai Bhadur and it was said they served rice and meat in Dekyilinga.   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  They probably didn&apos;t sign a written document about this.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  Let alone a written one, they didn&apos;t even have a verbal agreement. At about that time, Kong was supposed to have had some problem. He was supposed to have knocked at the main gate of the Norbulinga at night, etc. How did that happen?   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  I know about it, but at the moment I don&apos;t remember the details. When I remember later I will tell you.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  There is something about Sharpa Gyalpo?   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  Sharpa Gyalpo was during the 13th Dalai Lama&apos;s period. At that time, there was a lot of restrictions in Tibet to sell tobacco, cigarettes, etc. He had a shop in Dongtsesur [Tib. &#xF42;&#xF51;&#xF7C;&#xF44;&#xF0B;&#xF62;&#xFA9;&#xF7A;&#xF0B;&#xF5F;&#xF74;&#xF62;] in the Barkor, and he did everything that was illegal, everything he was not allowed to, he sold. There was a joint Tibetans and Nepalese office called Gorshib Legung [Tib. &#xF42;&#xF7C;&#xF62;&#xF0B;&#xF5E;&#xF72;&#xF56;&#xF0B;&#xF63;&#xF66;&#xF0B;&#xF41;&#xF74;&#xF44;&#xF66;] in which they looked after the Nepalese. The Tibetan government made thorough inquiries. These inquiries revealed that his mother was purely Tibetan and his father happened to be a Nepalese. While he was selling this contraband and acting lawlessly, one day, since the 13th Dalai Lama was forceful, he was arrested. When the soldiers came to arrest him, he ran into the office of the Nepalese Consulate General. The soldiers entered the office and finally got him. I think it was during the M&#xF6;nlam period that he was arrested. When he was arrested, the Nepalese said that he was Nepalese, so the Shengo could not handle it. It had to be discussed in the Gorshib Legung. Finally it was discussed in the Gorshib Legung. The Nepalese came to discuss this matter and from the Tibetan side, actually, the Shengo was told that he was Nepalese and that he could punish him or whatever he wanted to do. But the Tibetan government side made the Shengo say, &quot;As far as Sharpa Gyalpo is concerned, his mother is Tibetan and his father is Nepalese. Therefore, his flesh belongs to Tibet and his bones belong to Nepal, so we will cut and take all the flesh out of him and give you the bones.&quot; Finally, they were scared and had to apologize and promise not to repeat those activities again.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  Didn&apos;t he die in jail?   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  Not at that time. Was he dead? I don&apos;t remember very clearly.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  At that time, the Nepalese king wrote a letter to the Dalai Lama and the Dalai Lama also wrote a letter and apologized. This didn&apos;t work out and the British intervened, and the Nepalese threatened to have a war with Tibet because of this?   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  The Shengo was blamed for everything done wrong.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  But finally, the Dalai Lama had to apologize, don&apos;t you know about this?   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  No, I don&apos;t know about sending the letters.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  I heard the liaison officer of the Tibetan government appointed for Kong Chuzhang was Samjola [Tib. &#xF56;&#xF66;&#xF58;&#xF0B;&#xF58;&#xF46;&#xF7C;&#xF42;&#xF0B;&#xF63;&#xF42;&#xF66;].   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  No, no, no, not this Samjo. This Samjo is another Samjo. He was a tall tsidrung called W&#xF6;ser [Tib. &#xF60;&#xF7C;&#xF51;&#xF0B;&#xF5F;&#xF7A;&#xF62;] Samjo. He was the liaison officer, not Thubden Samjo.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  When Geshe Sherab Gyatso came, he came up to Nagchu. He came, but he was not allowed to come into Tibet. How did that happen?   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  At that time, the three great monasteries probably put a lot of effort into Geshe coming up. I was the sh&#xF6;ndr&#xF6;n and as far as I know about the situation, the tsondu had no objection to Geshe Sherab coming into Tibet. Geshela had already come out of Nagchu and was willing to come in. The monasteries were supporting it very much for Geshe Sherab to come and the tsondu had no objection. This is my understanding of it. If I tell you the truth, it was Taktra himself who didn&apos;t want Geshe Sherab to enter the country. It was he who objected. As far as my understanding and my judgement is concerned, his proposals could be passed. When they first came, there was no problem in the tsondu at all. But then gradually, day after day, it became more and more worse, more difficulties showed up. It was controlled [Tib. &#xF42;&#xF45;&#xF74;&#xF66;&#xF0B;&#xF55;&#xF74;&#xF62;&#xF0B;&#xF62;&#xF92;&#xFB1;&#xF42;] from the top, that was very clear to me.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  I heard that at first it was said that the Geshe could come and that he also had a pupil with him.   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  He must have had a partner to talk because he was communist&apos;s [answer not finished]...   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  He was not communist. At that time, there were no communists.   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  He was very close to the communists at that time.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  This was in 1944 when there were no communists in China. They had gone for the Long March. It was around the 2nd World War.   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  I know this very clearly because the late, older K&#xFC;ndeling Dzasa was a very close friend of Geshe Sherab and he was keen that Geshe Sherab should come in. That was why I kept my ears open and observed very carefully, so that is why I know that it was Taktra who put the brake on it, he put a full stop on that point.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  How was that question raised in the tsondu? He could have just walked in and nobody would say anything?   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  That was not possible.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  Did he ask for permission to come?   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  Any person who came via the Nagchu route needed to have permission from the Central Tibetan Government in those days. And even businessmen who came from Xining, the Xining Garp&#xF6;n, would guarantee to Nagchu Dzong with a certificate saying, &quot;This is a Chinese, or Huhu [Muslim], or not a Huhu. He has this many horses to sell, this many things to sell and he has nothing to do with politics.&quot; The Xining Garp&#xF6;n had to guarantee to the Nagchu Dzong. The Nagchu dzongp&#xF6;n would send this along with his recommendation to Lhasa and if Lhasa approved, they could come in. Otherwise, they could not just walk in at all, so Geshela had no way to walk through. If he just came in as Geshe Sherab alone, it might have been possible for him to go through, but that was also very difficult because he was a very well-known person. It was probably impossible. He was stopped by Taktra because these two never could get along well, so Taktra had a very strong objection against Geshe Sherab. That was the real cause.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  At that time, the Kashag found that this was not an easy thing and didn&apos;t approve and consult the tsondu because they found that it was not an easy work, right? Normally, they would not consult the Kashag, right?   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  Yes, I know further, though I have not read the letters and the official documents, but on the basis of what I heard, he, Geshela, said that he would like to discuss many things with the Tibetan government regarding the Chinese, etc. That he had definitely said.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  In the beginning, it was kind of quite loose [Tib. &#xF63;&#xFB7;&#xF74;&#xF42;&#xF0B;&#xF63;&#xFB7;&#xF74;&#xF42;] in the tsondu, how did it become like this?   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  After that, they reported up and down and then, day after day, the problems become harder and harder and people begin to say, &quot;Now it is doubtful that he can come.&quot; Finally, they said no. It was Taktra who stopped him. Otherwise, there was quite a hope and also high respect for Geshela, and his khamtsen and mitsen liked to send people to welcome him. Welcome groups were going to be something big.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  Why do you say that it was Taktra. You mean to say that both are learned and well-known scholars, so they don&apos;t like each other? Was that the reason?   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  That was definitely the reason. The excuse they used was that he was on a political mission. There were political implications, etc. They gave it a political coloring. In reality, the truth was that those two learned men didn&apos;t get along well. Taktra happened to be the regent, so he exercised his power.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  Did those talks occupy a number of days in the tsondu?   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  Not many, two or three days. Then they decided not to let him in. Then Geshela went back.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  Who was with Geshela at that time?   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  I don&apos;t remember. There were so many people there at that time. Geshela had not come as an individual. It looked as if he had came sort of on an official mission.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  This was the year when a plane had crashed in Tsetang.   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  Yes, it was during World War II.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  It was at this time that Heinrich Harrer and all consorts had come to Tibet, do you remember that?   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  I do remember that very clearly. In that time, either Chang&#xF6;ba [Tib. &#xF56;&#xFB1;&#xF0B;&#xF51;&#xF44;&#xF7C;&#xF66;&#xF0B;&#xF54;] or Tangme [Tib. &#xF50;&#xF44;&#xF0B;&#xF66;&#xFA8;&#xF51;], one of them was looking after the electricity department in Lhasa.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  Which Tangme are you talking about. Was it the present Tangme? Is this present Tangme the one who went to London?   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  Yes, he is the one who went to London and he did very good work. He was good in electronics. We heard that two foreigners had come and they were at the Electricity House. I went down there because it was very close to where I lived. I went down and saw the two of them with beards, wearing Tibetan woolen boots, somba [Tib. &#xF5F;&#xF7C;&#xF53;&#xF0B;&#xF54;], and they looked very poor and tired. I heard that they didn&apos;t know any other language except English. They fled from Dehradun prison up to the T&#xF6; area and then they came to Lhasa. In those days we didn&apos;t know where Dehradun was. One month or so later, we heard that Heinrich had moved to Tsarong. Tsarong had rented him a house and he had moved into Tsarong&apos;s place. Aufschnaiter had been transferred from the Electricity House and he was kept in Dogde [Tib. &#xF51;&#xF7C;&#xF42;&#xF0B;&#xF56;&#xF51;&#xF7A;], where they were growing trees and building canals. He was probably an engineer. For that he was transferred to the office in charge of planting trees [Tib. &#xF63;&#xF95;&#xF44;&#xF0B;&#xF60;&#xF5B;&#xF74;&#xF42;&#xF66;&#xF0B;&#xF51;&#xF7C;&#xF0B;&#xF51;&#xF58;] and he was very, very helpful with planting trees and the making canals. Heinrich was not working on those lines. Heinrich didn&apos;t know anything about those things. But gradually he built up a circle of friends. He spoke Tibetan. Among his most important friends were Lobsang Samden [Tib. &#xF56;&#xFB3;&#xF7C;&#xF0B;&#xF56;&#xF5F;&#xF44;&#xF0B;&#xF56;&#xF66;&#xF58;&#xF0B;&#xF42;&#xF4F;&#xF53;] and Sh&#xF6;lkang Jedrung. They went around everywhere and he became very popular. On the other hand, Aufschnaiter was a very quiet person. He did his work, what was given to him every month by the government. He took that money and kept quiet, and did his work and made the plan to build the Shangthab [Tib. &#xF42;&#xF5E;&#xF44;&#xF0B;&#xF60;&#xF51;&#xF56;&#xF66;] Power Station. These were the different personalities these two had.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  The year after this is the Wood-Bird year, 1945. It was the time of the Lhundrup Dzong trouble. We have discussed this.   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  Yes, we have discussed this in detail, so there is no need to repeat it.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  But I have one more question. Though Repe Gyawu, etc. from Sera were not among the ringleaders in the Lhundrup Dzong incident, right? However, they had been given lashes, were sent into exile etc. All of this happened, why was that?   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  It was because they were the ones who said that they would not hand over the ringleaders.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  Don&apos;t you think that the punishment was more severe and rigorous in comparison to the crime they had committed.   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  It depends on how they explain it and that is it. Whether they interpreted it as something big, as a revolt against the government.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  At that time, the government did not send soldiers to Sera, did it?   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  I don&apos;t think so, I don&apos;t remember.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  At that time, they had some trouble. The monks had refused to come to attend the M&#xF6;nlam (the Prayer Festival), but then they later attended it, how did that happen?   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  If I recall correctly, then they kind of mediated. The Khamba traders in Lhasa, especially headed by a man I remember named Kumpiling Ch&#xF6;ndze, mainly negotiated, and because of that, there was some kind of settlement arranged. That was why the monks attended.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  How did they settle it? Tell me some details.   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  At first the monks might have said that they were not coming to the M&#xF6;nlam. Later they were told that they should not do that and later, they accepted to come.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  I heard that Shakabpa was among the investigation committee. So I asked about this and he said, &quot;In that year, the Dalai Lama was invited to the M&#xF6;nlam Assembly [Tib. &#xF5A;&#xF7C;&#xF42;&#xF66;&#xF0B;&#xF55;&#xF7A;&#xF56;&#xF66;] and after the M&#xF6;nlam, the investigation took place in Sh&#xF6;l. Then they caught each person one by one and sent them to Tse for interrogation because they thought if they sent them together, there might have been some kind of danger. Later, they were shut in Sh&#xF6;l Prison and they were lashed. And they made them ride oxen and banished them. Rebe Gyau was lashed so severely, that he had pieces of flesh kept in a cloth bag.&quot;   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  I don&apos;t know if this is true or not.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  Among the investigation committee, there was Kapsh&#xF6;ba and he was aggressive.   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  He was probably a tsip&#xF6;n.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  He went through the motions of being angry and hit Rebe Gyau&apos;s head with the samtra message writing board [Tib. &#xF66;&#xF58;&#xF0B;&#xF41;&#xFB2;].   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  This could be because he was ,,,unclear.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  During World War II they came to borrow the road. How did that happen?   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  I don&apos;t know, about that part I have nothing to say because I don&apos;t know at all. As far as I remember, there was a meeting about whether they should allow them to use the road through Tibet to carry military equipment, arms and ammunition, but we didn&apos;t see whoever had come. Actually, somebody had come. He was the man who had requested to transport the arms and ammunition. No one like that ever came.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  At that time, an American captain called what? He came.   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  Wasn&apos;t that Tolstoy? Tolstoy was there during Reting&apos;s reign and he also took a photo with Reting wearing a monk&apos;s robe. At that time, I was Reting&apos;s neshen.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  The American captain whose neshen was Derge Sey and he went through Kham.   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  I don&apos;t know his name.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  Weren&apos;t two of them [the other was Dolan], the main ones who asked for the road? I heard that they went through the motions of asking, but internally they came to check whether the road was useful or not. If it was useful, they were to use it regardless of whether it was borrowed or not.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  What about the Victory Congratulation Delegation?   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  Regarding this, Derge Sey has written in the Chinese published book about being the neshen of the Americans and going to Kham. It was written in the books where Lhalu wrote about being the doji, and Lhautara on the 17-Point Agreement wrote a lot.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  There were two volumes.   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  I think it is in the 1st volume.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  When did you see this book?   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  At the end of last year, 1983.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  Did you see this in Dharamsala?   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  I got the book here.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  About the Victory Congratulation Delegations [Tib. &#xF42;&#xF61;&#xF74;&#xF63;&#xF0B;&#xF62;&#xF92;&#xFB1;&#xF63;&#xF0B;&#xF56;&#xF40;&#xFB2;&#xF0B;&#xF64;&#xF72;&#xF66;&#xF0B;&#xF56;&#xF51;&#xF7A;&#xF0B;&#xF63;&#xF7A;&#xF42;&#xF66;], why did they have to go and who gave the idea? And what was all of this about?   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  Since the war was over and the 4 powerful nations won the victory, and the Japanese and Germany lost, we needed to build foreign relations. In order to build foreign relations, we needed to build up contacts. Also, it was the time in which the Guomindang was having a national meeting [Ch. guo min da hui]. They insisted that for this meeting, the Tibetan government should have representatives. Secondly, they also made us understand that if Tibetans did not attend, then the Panchen Lama, Panchen Labrang and other people were going to represent Tibet. That was sort of bypassing the Tibetan government, going sideways, when they were going to represent Tibet. That was also a danger. For these two purposes, they sent, jointly, this Victory Congratulation Delegation. I thought Kheme had written about this clearly. As I said, in one direction they needed to build a good strong foreign relationship. On the other hand it was necessary to attend the meeting of the Guomindang, though we didn&apos;t know what was happening. We had no idea about what was happening and what it was all about. But they were insisting and also we thought it necessary to attend. They couldn&apos;t go as representatives, so as an excuse to cover that up, they say their congratulations of the victory. That was sent to China and along with that, they congratulated the British and America too. What is wrong with that?   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  Did they attend the meeting of the Guomindang?   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  Yes, they did attend the Guomindang meeting, but not as full-fledged members, but as observers who went there. They said, &quot;We have no orders from the government to attend this meeting. However, we would like to sit in on the meeting.&quot; This is how they went. I thought Kheme had written quite clearly about this.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>    </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  Chang&#xF6;ba wrote very well in the book as being under the Chinese control. The point he indicated was that they went to attend the meeting as observers they went to prove that Tibet was independent.   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  In the first book, Lhautara mentioned in detail how we contacted the British representative, taking their advice, etc. etc. I have written details about this.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  Do you have anymore specific details regarding the delegation which was sent to the Asian Conference in 1947? When the Tibetan government didn&apos;t want to be involved in the Guomindang meeting then why were they sending a delegation?   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  We wanted to know who was attending. We wanted to see it. Also, if we didn&apos;t send representatives, then the places in the meeting would be taken by the Panchen Lama and this other group of people. That is why there was a problem and why it became necessary for us to send a delegation. But not as real delegation members but as observers.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  There were the delegates of the Panchen and the Khambas, and they shouted and signed their names. I have heard that Khenjung Thubden Sangpo [Tib. &#xF50;&#xF74;&#xF56;&#xF0B;&#xF56;&#xF66;&#xF9F;&#xF53;&#xF0B;&#xF56;&#xF5F;&#xF44;&#xF0B;&#xF54;&#xF7C;] was among the chairman [Ch. zhu xi], and the clerk of Kapsh&#xF6;ba was also there raising hands. I believe that there were also photographers?   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  He was the member of the bureau down there. That might not have been this national meeting, several Guomindang meetings were held.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  This was the same meeting. The photos were in the British&apos;s India office library.   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  On the Guomindang National Congress, there was Thubden Sangye [Tib. &#xF50;&#xF74;&#xF56;&#xF0B;&#xF56;&#xF66;&#xF9F;&#xF53;&#xF0B;&#xF66;&#xF44;&#xF66;&#xF0B;&#xF62;&#xF92;&#xFB1;&#xF66;] and Dzasa Ngawang Gyentsen [Tib. &#xF44;&#xF42;&#xF0B;&#xF51;&#xF56;&#xF44;&#xF0B;&#xF62;&#xF92;&#xFB1;&#xF63;&#xF0B;&#xF58;&#xF5A;&#xF53;] who was then tsendr&#xF6;n.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  No, it was Thubden Sangpo because it was just after that Reting incident occurred.   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  It must be.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  During the Lhundrup Dzong trouble, did we have any talk or any problems regarding the Tawang border area?   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  What does that have to do with Lhundrup Dzong?   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  I mean in the same period, was there any talk taking place in Lhasa because we understood that even the British may be willing to give up the Tawang area, to give the Tawang area back to Tibet.   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  I don&apos;t know about that period but when the British handed over the administration to India, India sent a request to put the treaties Tibet had signed with the British in the name of the Indian administration. That request came to Tibet and they were startled very much.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  Through whom did they request?   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  Through Richardson of Dekyilinga to the Kashag.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  Why were they startled?   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  They trusted the British treaty very much, regarding it as very effective. At that time, it was really stupid. Actually, it would have been very good if they had sent people to sign the treaty. But, there may have been some Guomindang policy involved in it.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  Please tell me in detail what was happening and where you were at that time.   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  I was a sh&#xF6;ndr&#xF6;n.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  In that case, you should know everything. So what happened?   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  Finally, they decided not to [tansfer British rights to India]. They had even given a reply. I think that we were unable to do this. They even gave as a reply that they were basing the treaty off of the English, but that they were not going to sign with India for the time being.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  Because of that, India announced that the previous treaty was disregarded.   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  At that time, some people however, insisted, even among the Tibetan officers, to send a delegation to sign the treaty.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  Who were they?   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  I don&apos;t remember who they were but some objected.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  They must have been from the monasteries.   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  Probably, because if there was a Guomindang influence, then naturally it came through the monasteries. So it must have been from there. If that had been signed with India, this automatically would have upset the Chinese plans and ideas. So they probably influenced them not to do it.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  At that time, the regent was Taktra, right?   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  Yes, probably, and Reting&apos;s chapter was over.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  Shakabpa was among the ones who went to talk and he said that the Nehru told him that it would be good to send delegates to sign the [new] treaty and he reported to the higher ups, but they didn&apos;t respond.   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  When each person held a policy, if they signed a treaty, this would influence the Chinese because we signed it directly with India. But, actually, when we think about it now, it would have been very helpful.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  This would be strong evidence to prove Tibet&apos;s independence. Was it just after India got independence when they wanted to sign the treaty, in 1947 or 1948? Did they request that after Melon came to Dekyilinga?   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  It was at the time of Richardson. Melon came after the Chinese arrival.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  After Richardson, it was Sina, right?   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  Yes.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  Was there any other important reason to visit and to go for the Victory Congratulation beside the invitation you received? I ask this question because I heard that some people carried a number of boxes of documents, dealing with the border area to discuss them with the new Indian authorities.   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  I don&apos;t know this clearly, but I don&apos;t think Sambo carried any documents dealing with the border, at all. Because Sambo&apos;s colleague was Khenjung Lobsang Wangyal [Tib. &#xF56;&#xFB3;&#xF7C;&#xF0B;&#xF56;&#xF5F;&#xF44;&#xF0B;&#xF51;&#xF56;&#xF44;&#xF0B;&#xF62;&#xF92;&#xFB1;&#xF63;] and he was my teacher in the service of the tsidrung. This was like the guarantor teacher in the monasteries. This was considered as important among the tsidrung )monk officials) because we had to sign a pledge in the Yigtsang. At that time, for the staff members there was one lay official and one tsidrung. The lay appointed was Kabsh&#xF6;sey [Tib. &#xF40;&#xF0B;&#xF64;&#xF7C;&#xF51;&#xF0B;&#xF66;&#xFB2;&#xF66;]. As for tsidrung, they gave me the first chance, as the number one candidate. The second candidate was a tsidrung called Kungala [Tib. &#xF40;&#xF74;&#xF53;&#xF0B;&#xF51;&#xF42;&#xF60;&#xF0B;&#xF63;&#xF42;&#xF66;], who was slightly related to the Sambo family. Everybody thought it normal that I should have been appointed. They approved my name, but later, the list of names came out of the regents&apos; office. It was changed, and Kungala was given the chance to go and I had been turned down.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  Sambo Tenzin Th&#xF6;ndrub [Tib. &#xF56;&#xF66;&#xF58;&#xF0B;&#xF55;&#xF7C;&#xF0B;&#xF56;&#xF66;&#xF9F;&#xF53;&#xF0B;&#xF60;&#xF5B;&#xF72;&#xF53;] came to India to that meeting, how was that possible?   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  He might have gone on his own but not as a member of the official delegation. I think he went on his own but not as part of the official delegation. The official delegation was actually as follows: the lay official was Kabsh&#xF6;sey and also the interpreter, and the tsidrung was Kungala. I was watching the situation and I remember this quite well because I was following carefully what was happening. But there was no talk or discussion about the subject of the border raised at all in Tibet. The meeting was regarded as important, saying the there were delegates from all the countries.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  If it was important, there should be a Shape.   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  Shape would not go.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  Sambo told me after he was released that the Chinese told him that this was called the Nauseating Drama [Tib. &#xF66;&#xF90;&#xFB1;&#xF74;&#xF42;&#xF0B;&#xF56;&#xFB2;&#xF7C;&#xF0B;&#xF56;&#xF60;&#xF72;&#xF0B;&#xF5F;&#xFB3;&#xF7C;&#xF66;&#xF0B;&#xF42;&#xF62;], and they showed the photo of the [people] attending the meeting and asked him his opinion. He told the Chinese he couldn&apos;t remember, that it had been many years. Now we are almost touching on the Reting case. Wasn&apos;t there some point where the Lhalu was shot at in the sandy area?   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  Yes, it was said that Khardo [Tib. &#xF58;&#xF41;&#xF62;&#xF0B;&#xF62;&#xFA1;&#xF7C;] Rimpoche was the shooter. This is among the Reting incident. He was shot near Kangnadong [Tib. &#xF60;&#xF41;&#xF62;&#xF0B;&#xF62;&#xF94;&#xF0B;&#xF42;&#xF51;&#xF7C;&#xF53;], the east side of the Potala, and it was confessed by Khardo without asking him.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  How did Gyeyab, the Dalai Lama&apos;s father, die? It was about this year? Can you tell [me] something about it?   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  He got sick and he died suddenly. What people talked about later, I do not know. But at that time, there was not a single word that he got poisoned and all this, not a single word at that time. Not only that, but there was not many cases of poisoning at all in Tibet, not very much at all, very, very little. Even in the case of Reting, everybody suspected that Reting was killed, but no one mentioned a word about poisoning. They said that his testicles were squashed or things like that, but nothing about poison at all.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  This bomb explosion at Drunyichemmo&apos;s house, what is the true story? Because we all know that the bomb exploded there. Regarding this, Mr. Shakabpa mentioned it in detail in his book. Where were you then?   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  I was in Lhasa.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  How did that happen? Were you tsendr&#xF6;n?   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  Yes.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  So you have heard about this, right?   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  Yes, this was written in the verdict issued to Reting.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  In Shakabpa&apos;s book, it says that because the leaflets were thrown in the Phodrang Sarpa [Tib. &#xF55;&#xF7C;&#xF0B;&#xF56;&#xFB2;&#xF44;&#xF0B;&#xF42;&#xF66;&#xF62;&#xF0B;&#xF54;], therefore, Gyambumgang Drunyichemmo&apos;s house was raided.   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  They did not raid his house. What I heard was that the bomb had definitely been delivered to Drunyichemmo&apos;s house, but I didn&apos;t see the box of the bomb at all, but the people say that the chandz&#xF6; opened the box and the bomb exploded. My understanding is that the bomb was delivered and also the letter was thrown into the house almost simultaneously.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  All at once?   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  Simultaneously.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  The box was sent by the Doji Dzasa Yuthok to the Regent, right?   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  Yes.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  If that is so, then why did Gyambumgang Drunyichemmo&apos;s chandz&#xF6; open this parcel which was addressed to the Regent? What Shakabpa said that because the leaflets were thrown in Phodrang Sarpa, they suspected and opened the box. I heard that when the bomb exploded, it made holes in the walls and it made the cupboards like the pockmarked person&apos;s face.   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  This must be true. What I have heard is that this parcel was received at the drunyichemmo&apos;s house and the letter [leaflets] was [were] thrown in Phodrang Sarpa at almost the same time. Drunyichemmo had told his brother, who was known as Nyerpala, that he had to be careful, so he opened it. Because of [that] the Reting trouble started. At that time I was a tsendr&#xF6;n. Early morning I was there in the Trungja tea meeting, and when the Trungja was about to be over, Chemmo (Phala) told me not to go and to to stay for a while. Chemmo was called by the Kashag, he went there and after that he came up. I don&apos;t know what matter he had to report to the Dalai Lama or what, but he went to the Dalai Lama&apos;s place. After that, the Chemmo came out and told the other tsendr&#xF6;n that most of them could go home, but that a few of them may have to stay for a while. He told me that I had to stay for a while.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  What was happening at this time? Was there something that had to do with Reting happening? Do you know about it?   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  Yes, we had already heard that two shape had left last night. All of this I heard, so I knew that something was happening. Then Chemmo told me, &quot;You go and get the bugdam, the Dalai Lama&apos;s seal.&quot; When you have to confiscate the property of anyone, for what we called, gothel [Tib. &#xF66;&#xF92;&#xF7C;&#xF0B;&#xF50;&#xF7A;&#xF63;] [sealing the property], no other seals could be used except the bugdam. The dr&#xF6;nyerchemmo was not allowed to carry the bugdam. It had to be carried by the tsendr&#xF6;n representatives, which meant one of the tsendr&#xF6;n who represented the Dalai Lama, he carried it. The normal system was that the moment you get the bugdam, the seal, you had to wrap it in a yellow brocade ball and carry it on your back. After that Chemmo told me, &quot;Now, let&apos;s go&quot;.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  At that time, the Chemmo didn&apos;t tell you anything internally, right?   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  He didn&apos;t say anything. By that time, Chemmo should have known it because without the knowledge of the Chemmo, they could not get the bugdam. So in order to get the bugdam, Chemmo needed to know what was happening. The bugdam was in the Dalai Lama&apos;s room. It could only be taken out by the Jigyab khembo or either of the Dalai Lama&apos;s three personal attendants [Tib. &#xF42;&#xF66;&#xF7C;&#xF63;&#xF0B;&#xF42;&#xF5F;&#xF72;&#xF58;].   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  Who brought the bugdam on that day?   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  That day when I took it, I didn&apos;t see the Jigyab Khembo.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  At that time, who was the Jigyab khembo?   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  It was Jayangkyil Khyenrabla [Tib. &#xF60;&#xF47;&#xF58;&#xF0B;&#xF51;&#xF56;&#xFB1;&#xF44;&#xF66;&#xF0B;&#xF51;&#xF40;&#xFB1;&#xF72;&#xF63;&#xF0B;&#xF58;&#xF41;&#xFB1;&#xF7A;&#xF53;&#xF0B;&#xF62;&#xF56;&#xF0B;&#xF63;&#xF42;&#xF66;]. I was probably given it by the personal attendant in charge of clothes, the P&#xF6;npo Kudrepa [Tib. &#xF66;&#xF90;&#xF74;&#xF0B;&#xF56;&#xF42;&#xFB2;&#xF7A;&#xF66;&#xF0B;&#xF54;]. When we went down near the Kashag gate, all the drungtsi were waiting for us. Normally to seal the property, Chemmo did not have to go in person, he just a sent a representative. But in this case, it looked to be the Kashag order that the chemmo had to go. After that, amongst the junior staff we started talking. &quot;What is it, where are we going? We don&apos;t know where and what is happening. We don&apos;t know but it must be some trouble,&quot; we were talking something like that. Then we left. When we were reaching Reting&apos;s Labrang near Demo Trokhang, the summer cottage, when we reached there, there were some geyog, the assistant of disciplinary officer, gek&#xF6; [Tib. &#xF51;&#xF42;&#xF7A;&#xF0B;&#xF56;&#xF66;&#xF90;&#xF7C;&#xF66;] and some kitchen helpers [Tib. &#xF50;&#xF56;&#xF0B;&#xF42;&#xF61;&#xF7C;&#xF42;].   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  Had they already reached there?   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  Not only had they already reached there, but at the right and the left side, there were also already soldiers. At the outer gate of Shide, everyone got down from their horses.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  I heard that Shakabpa dismounted his house and took a few steps ahead from the side.   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  Everyone got down from their horses at the outer gate of Shide and they walked along the alley near the labrang. Then I thought that they were definitely going to Reting Labrang. At the gate, Drunyichemmo Ch&#xF6;mpel Thubden called me and said, &quot;Look, tsendr&#xF6;n. You go up from here through Shide and go up to Reting Labrang and see who is there.&quot; I went up and the dzasa was not there, but the ex-dzasa was there and all the other staff was functioning as normal everyday life. I came out and told them, &quot;The dzasa is not in but all the other staff is there as usual.&quot; I told them that and then they talked among themselves and they said, &quot;Wouldn&apos;t it be better that we go in now?&quot; They went in from the area outside the main gate [Tib. &#xF66;&#xF92;&#xF7C;&#xF0B;&#xF58;&#xF46;&#xF7C;&#xF62;] of Shide faced towards Reting Labrang. They went up and asked, &quot;Where is the dzasa?&quot; They said that he was not in, he had gone to Yabshi, but the ex-dzasa was there and they saluted to him. Only later I came to know that they suspected that the Reting people would shoot them and that they were on alert when they went in along the stone floor.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  Did they really have doubts [suspicions]?   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  They were really suspicious. That was why they sent me. That is what I came to know later. Also, when they walked through the courtyard they were quite careful. At this time, the ex-dzasa came out. When he came out they saluted to him. Then ex-dzasa said, &quot;Please come in.&quot; They went with the ex-dzasa but they didn&apos;t enter the room. The ex-dzasa invited them into the room. They didn&apos;t go and they sat on the outskirts of the room, like a veranda, above the staircase. Normally the young people of Reting sat there in the sun and talked. On that day they all sat there. Then they asked where dzasa was? the ex-dzasa replied saying that he had just then gone to Yabshi. Then they said that they should send someone to call him. Immediately they sent someone.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  I understand that Shatra [Tib. &#xF56;&#xF64;&#xF51;&#xF0B;&#xF66;&#xF92;&#xFB2;] and Tsarong were sent?   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  No, no. First someone was sent from Reting Labrang and that took some time. Then I think they sent Shatra and Tsarong later. I remember this, but first was definitely Reting Labrang&apos;s man. At about that time, dzasa came with horses and they invited him in. Dzasa invited all of them inside his room. When they entered into the room they, of course, had to salute him and that is what they did. Then, I think it was the senior drunyichemmo, Ta lama, who said, &quot;By the order of the Kashag, there have been some problems and two Kal&#xF6;n have gone to invite the regent. And both of you, you and the ex-dzasa, have to go to the Kashag for a while.&quot; They all said, &quot;Yes.&quot; They had nothing else to say but &quot;Yes.&quot; The moment it was told to the two dzasa, they put a saddle on their horses and they left. The moment they left they told us to seal it. We started sealing and we sealed all the houses. We sealed everything except the stores downstairs and the treasury downstairs. Otherwise, all the rooms, including the chandz&#xF6; office, all were sealed. It took a long time to seal every house, the rooms, etc. After sometime they told Ngab&#xF6;, &quot;Isn&apos;t it better that you go now? Why don&apos;t you go?&quot; When Reting&apos;s property was sealed, they came out and they were told to go to Sandutsang. I was told to go to Ph&#xFC;nkang and I was quite close to Ph&#xFC;nkang&apos;s house. I went up and I saw that Sawangchemmo was there. His son was there and all of their daughters and in-laws were there. About that time, when Reting Labrang was sealed, they saw that from the top of the roof. When we were facing toward them, [Princess] Kukula of Sikkim came out and called me, &quot;&#xF6;gyenla, what did we do wrong? What did we do wrong and why do they have to come here?&quot; I said, &quot;How do I know? They are coming behind me.&quot; That is what I said, and I went back and told this to the drungtsi. They were all there, so they went up. They went up and met Ph&#xFC;nkang Sawangchemmo. Again they saluted him, and they sent Ph&#xFC;nkang Sawangchemmo and his sons up to the Potala Sharchenjog, and after that they sealed their house. They had to send the dzasa first because they had to issue the order from sh&#xF6; ga and take off the dzasa&apos;s dress. Ph&#xFC;nkang&apos;s sealing was much less, because there had been no trouble in Reting, there wouldn&apos;t be trouble in Ph&#xFC;nkang. So there was no worry, a sort of relaxed atmosphere. So naturally they didn&apos;t seal that right away. Many of it was also left unsealed. After that we went to Sandutsang and when we came there, Ngab&#xF6; had already reached there. Then Gyurmela [Tib. &#xF60;&#xF42;&#xFB1;&#xF74;&#xF62;&#xF0B;&#xF58;&#xF7A;&#xF51;&#xF0B;&#xF63;&#xF42;&#xF66;] was sent up to the Potala and then we sealed Sandutsang. It was very late. The second rule was, the seal I was carrying, the bugdam, could never be allowed to be kept in your own place overnight. No matter how late it was, you had to return it. So after that we returned to the Potala to return the seal.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  Was Chemmo with you?   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  Yes. This is the chapter of how this sealing was done. That was this day, and beside that, nothing happened.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  What happened to Nyungne [Tib. &#xF66;&#xF99;&#xF74;&#xF44;&#xF0B;&#xF42;&#xF53;&#xF66;] Lama?   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  At that time, nothing happened to him. He was staying in Nyungne Temple and nothing happened to Khardo also. Then one or two days later, even Reting Rimpoche had already [been] put in Sharchenjog, the dzasa were jailed. Then the talk came, &quot;Nyungne Lama has to be caught, or his property has to be sealed. Then Khardo has to be caught and his property has to be sealed.&quot; All of this talk came two days later. And quite a number of the small seals were done. When they were sealed, I was not there because I went that day, so the day after I didn&apos;t have to go.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  When it was a sealing, the bugdam had to be used, right?   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  Yes.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  The Kashag seal, Kadam [Tib. &#xF56;&#xF40;&#xF60;&#xF0B;&#xF51;&#xF58;], or the regent&apos;s seal, Sidam [Tib. &#xF66;&#xFB2;&#xF72;&#xF51;&#xF0B;&#xF51;&#xF58;], were not allowed, right?   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  Yes, the next day, Reting Rimpoche came.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  Where were you then?   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  I was at Tse.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  So you saw Reting coming?   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  I saw he was on the red mule. I knew that mule. He got down from the mule at the inner stone pillar in Sh&#xF6;l Doring Nangma [Tib. &#xF62;&#xFA1;&#xF7C;&#xF0B;&#xF62;&#xF72;&#xF44;&#xF0B;&#xF53;&#xF44;&#xF0B;&#xF58;] and then walked up, and the mule was held by Gyagp&#xF6;n Kelsang and the fourth rup&#xF6;n, Kelsang. Probably, the Fourth Rup&#xF6;n might have been the one who volunteered and was actually holding Reting&apos;s hand, in the outlook it seemed that he was helping him step up. His servant, the S&#xF6;p&#xF6;n, the son of the Jangra Sharpa [Tib. &#xF63;&#xF95;&#xF44;&#xF0B;&#xF62;&#xF0B;&#xF64;&#xF62;&#xF0B;&#xF54;], and also one Khamba monk bodyguard or simgag from Sang Ngag Ch&#xF6;dzong [Tib. &#xF42;&#xF66;&#xF44;&#xF0B;&#xF66;&#xFA3;&#xF42;&#xF66;&#xF0B;&#xF46;&#xF7C;&#xF66;&#xF0B;&#xF62;&#xFAB;&#xF7C;&#xF44;], who was known as a hero, the two of them were there. Then Reting Rimpoche was shut in Sharchenjog in one of the apartments of a Dalai Lama&apos;s tsidrung cooks [Tib. &#xF42;&#xF66;&#xF7C;&#xF63;&#xF0B;&#xF50;&#xF56;&#xF0B;&#xF54;]. Two servants were also kept in one house and then the investigation was started.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  There is an article written by the tsidrung nicknamed, &quot;Nepalese&quot; or Bepola [Tib. &#xF56;&#xF63;&#xF0B;&#xF54;&#xF7C;&#xF0B;&#xF63;&#xF42;&#xF66;]. Reting told him that there were gun shots and the soldiers were also shooting toward that direction. &quot;Then the Fourth Rup&#xF6;n caught my mule, and he took out a gun and stared at me. In case the monks came near me, it is definite that the Fourth Rup&#xF6;n was going to kill me.&quot;   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  Yes, if he killed Reting, he himself would have been killed right there by the monks, right?   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  Yes, I heard that that day they tricked the monks. They gave two different routes of the arrival of Reting Rimpoche. Is that true?   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  I have heard that also. They have said that he could not come by Dogde. They probably made the monks to know that Reting Rimpoche would be brought by Bongt&#xF6; [Tib. &#xF60;&#xF56;&#xFB2;&#xF7C;&#xF58;&#xF0B;&#xF66;&#xF9F;&#xF7C;&#xF51;].   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  So the monks went to Bongt&#xF6;.   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  It must be.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  Since you saw that Reting Rimpoche was coming back, did you see both shape, Surkhang as well as Lhalu coming back?   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  I definitely saw Surkhang but I didn&apos;t notice Lhalu. I don&apos;t remember.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  I have heard that Lhalu stayed behind Surkhang to seal the properties of Reting Rimpoche and Reting Labrang in Reting. They had their sealing done in Reting, but there was no bugdam seal. How was that possible?   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  This was because it was on a long distance journey and they didn&apos;t need the bugdam. Otherwise, the bugdam must return within the night itself and was not allowed to be kept overnight. While they were waiting for the arrival of the dzasa, there was one boy who was the servant of the dzasa. Who was the younger brother of S&#xF6;sh&#xF6;nla of Jangrashar. He was going up and down, and up and down, and finally he went down the staircases. I did not realize it until the next day, he went down from the place where we were, took a horse and left for Reting. There was another one called Khamtru [Tib. &#xF41;&#xF58;&#xF66;&#xF0B;&#xF55;&#xFB2;&#xF74;&#xF42;] who was from Kham, may be he was an official, Shabd&#xF6;ba. The two of them went. They met Reting Rimpoche on the way. They hid themselves and they talked about shooting, but since there were only two of them they didn&apos;t. Then they went to Reting and found the everything was sealed, and they found that there were about 50-60 soldiers headed by a gyagp&#xF6;n who was related to Jangrashar. After that, they told the Reting Dechang, who was in Reting and all the others, &quot;We cannot stay like this, we have to break those seals and take out arms and also the properties.&quot; But Dechang did not allow this, and he and the two boys who went from Lhasa and also the young servants of Reting Rimpoche and the young monks of the Reting monastery got together. They killed all the soldiers overnight. They broke the seals and took out all the arms, ammunition and whatever there was. There were only one or two soldiers left, I don&apos;t know, otherwise all of them had been killed. Then they left and reached China, via Kham.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  They didn&apos;t plan to fight toward here [Lhasa], right?   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  There was nothing to fight here because Reting Rimpoche was also taken. The boys couldn&apos;t enter Sera. If they could, the situation might have been a little bit better than this. Everything was destroyed there and later, many soldiers were sent. Also, over at Reting there was another simgag who was very strong and fought. He fought and later he even went to China and fought with the Communists, and I heard that he landed in Burma.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  Is he still alive?   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  Who knows. A group of Tibetans landed in Burma and at that time, they wandered into the hills I think, and even from Dharamsala, the government tried to send people to find out. We sent some agents to see what was happening but we couldn&apos;t catch up with them. So what I have told you so far is the truth as I have seen it and as I have experienced it.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  When Reting Rimpoche was brought to tsondu to be interrogated were you there?   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  I was not there, in the tsondu there were only representatives, I was not there.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  According to Shakabpa&apos;s book, and also according to normal talk, it was said that Reting Rimpoche confessed to all the charges that the Tibetan government raised against him. However, the articles from Lhasa, written by Tsidrung Bepo were saying that Reting Rimpoche did not confess to the charges. He had simply said that he would like to meet Taktra personally and he would not talk to the tsondu. At that time, Kapsh&#xF6;ba and Lhalu were not in the tsondu. This was a problem. What can you say about this? Shakabpa was in the tsondu. Shakabpa said that Reting confessed and said, &quot;We might have made a mistake, but I am going to report to the regent.&quot; Regarding whether he had confessed or not, there was some difference.   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  The books written in Tibet and written here are different, right?   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  Now, who are still here who used to be the tsondu members?   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  There isn&apos;t a single abbot here except some government officials. Tarala was not there, Thubden Sangye was not there and Ragashag and both the Taring were probably not there. Liushar was there, but he died.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  Chemmo probably knows?   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  He was at the meeting. I wonder who was the true representative of the senampa at that time. May be it was Taring George or may be it was Ragashag, but most probably not. Among the representatives of Ganden Jangtsa was Lodr&#xF6; W&#xF6;ser [Tib. &#xF56;&#xFB3;&#xF7C;&#xF0B;&#xF42;&#xFB2;&#xF7C;&#xF66;&#xF0B;&#xF60;&#xF7C;&#xF51;&#xF0B;&#xF5F;&#xF7A;&#xF62;], and the from Shartse it was one nicknamed &quot;Field Mouse&quot;, Abra [Tib. &#xF68;&#xF0B;&#xF56;&#xFB2;].   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  Regarding the Sera War. During the trouble there were some discussions that took some time to mediate, including the Ganden Tri Rimpoche [Tib. &#xF41;&#xFB2;&#xF72;&#xF0B;&#xF62;&#xF72;&#xF53;&#xF0B;&#xF54;&#xF7C;&#xF0B;&#xF46;&#xF7A;] and the others. There had been negotiations, and the Ganden Tri Rimpoche and some of the business community in Lhasa tried to negotiate, and some monks from Sera, including Geshe Phu Lama, came and talked. Geshe Phu Lama got angry and put his hand on his shoe and said that whatever might happen, they would fight etc.   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  This was true.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  I also heard that Loseling of Drepung planned to rise behind Sera Je? I heard that Sera Mey didn&apos;t move. If Sera Mey moved, it was decided that Loseling would rise up.   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  I never heard that. Though Gomang was Taktra&apos;s own tratsang and was supposed to be very important and close to Taktra, later they developed a lot of friction.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  Ngagpa and Deyang both didn&apos;t get along well [with] Taktra.   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  I see.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  Loseling and Ngagpa were supposed to be close [Tib. &#xF49;&#xF7A;&#xF0B;&#xF63;&#xF7C;&#xF42;]. Gomang and Deyang were supposed to be close. However, due to the nendr&#xF6;n, during the Taktra period, he made Ngagpa become close to Deyang. Because of that, during the Dalai Lama&apos;s visit to Drepung, the trumpets were blown from the roof of Loseling by Deyang, rather than the traditional partition system of Ngagpa. Do you remember anything about this or did you ever notice anything?   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  No.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  During that time, our Khendr&#xF6;nlosum in Nanjing were Thubden Sangpo, etc. I heard that they sent a telegram or something like that to the Tibetan government.   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  We didn&apos;t hear those things because they went to the Kashag and unless they passed it on to the tsondu, etc., we didn&apos;t hear from them. So officially we didn&apos;t hear about this.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  I have heard that Reting Rimpoche had sent Gyagp&#xF6;n Phu and Lakatsang to China to request to gain support from Chiang Kai Shek&apos;s side, did you know them or do you know anything about this?   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  Gyagp&#xF6;n Phu I knew, his son is in India. I don&apos;t know whether you remember it or not, Sandutsang&apos;s relation, a man named Gonje, he speaks both English and Tibetan and he used to be in Dalhousie working for the Indian intelligence. His father is Gyagp&#xF6;n Phu.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  The Lakatsang, is not the Lakatsang Chandz&#xF6;, right?   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  No, it is the other one called Adu Lakatsang, I think his name is Nyendra.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  I heard that these two are the people that went on behalf of Reting Rimpoche, at his request?   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  Must be. Gyagp&#xF6;n Phu spoke very good Chinese, good Tibetan and was a very good person to be able to converse. During the Guomindang he enjoyed and also a certain rank from the Chinese. He had quite a close link with the Chinese, down there.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  In the early times, the Tibetan government didn&apos;t have the modern type of soldiers. [Not] until the 13th Dalai Lama came from India, except [for] 3,000 traditional soldiers, like Simchugngwa. Were the riders during M&#xF6;nlam called Simpa [Tib. &#xF42;&#xF5F;&#xF72;&#xF58;&#xF0B;&#xF54;]?   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  The word &apos;Simba&apos; is the Simchugnga. They came from the places near Lhasa and they were called Simpa Dingkhag [Tib. &#xF42;&#xF5F;&#xF72;&#xF58;&#xF0B;&#xF54;&#xF0B;&#xF63;&#xFA1;&#xF72;&#xF44;&#xF0B;&#xF41;&#xF42;], and they got special kind of estates on which they had to produce soldiers. During the M&#xF6;nlam, the M&#xF6;nlam was supposed to be very important. In order to get peace by means of a settlement, they had those Simchugnga who are called Simba for the security. In addition to that, the high ranking officials were imposed as the riders [Tib. &#xF62;&#xF9F;&#xF0B;&#xF54;] during the M&#xF6;nlam as the reinforcements.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  Why were they called Simchungwa?   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  Probably, it was a kind of bodyguard.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  Was this spelled as [Tib. &#xF42;&#xF5F;&#xF72;&#xF58;&#xF0B;&#xF46;&#xF74;&#xF44;] which means the room.   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  Yes, this room was the Dalai Lama&apos;s room and that time, the Dalai Lama was called with the several names like K&#xFC;nd&#xFC;n Drung [Tib. &#xF66;&#xF90;&#xF74;&#xF0B;&#xF58;&#xF51;&#xF74;&#xF53;&#xF0B;&#xF51;&#xFB2;&#xF74;&#xF44;], Bug [Tib. &#xF66;&#xFA6;&#xF74;&#xF42;] and Simchung bug [Tib. &#xF42;&#xF5F;&#xF72;&#xF58;&#xF0B;&#xF46;&#xF74;&#xF44;&#xF0B;&#xF66;&#xFA6;&#xF74;&#xF42;]. These were old terms.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  Simpa means the households who were obliged to send soldiers, and the soldiers were called Simchungwa, right?   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  Yes.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  There was not a separate kind soldiers called Simpa other then the Simchungwa, right?   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  Yes.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  Since 1912, when the Dalai Lama came back to Tibet, the new soldiers came, right?   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  Yes.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  Since the soldiers came, the first military operation was done against the Drepung monks, right?   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  Yes.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  At that time, the people had this kind of viewpoint in the beginning, that it was the idea of the Dalai Lama to have the soldiers and it was important because we had to counter attack foreign forces like the British. If we didn&apos;t have soldiers, we would be able to cope with using sling shots. After that, when the Drepung monks made the commotion in Norbulinga and broke the flowers saying that they came to make a direct appeal to the Dalai Lama [Tib. &#xF55;&#xFB1;&#xF42;&#xF0B;&#xF60;&#xF5A;&#xF63;&#xF0B;&#xF62;&#xF92;&#xFB1;&#xF42;], the Tsogchen Shengo was made to kneel down for a day. Is that true?   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  I don&apos;t remember this. I was just a child.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  The government told the monks to go back and they would talk the day after, and the day after that the government was indeed to talk. If they didn&apos;t, the monks would make the commotion. But, after that, Tsarong led the soldiers in formation. So this was the first military operation against the Drepung monks. At that time, there were the people like the bearded dr&#xF6;nyerchemmo Abso, the elderly tsidrung who were on important posts and who were thoughtful, and also conservatives thought that this was a military operation.[end of the tape].   </p>
