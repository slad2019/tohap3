## Abstract  

 Kündeling Dzasa was a monk official and one of the top officials in Kündeling Labrang. In this interview he discusses the Tibetan government's Reform Office and its reform of interest rates and loans, of the horse/ carrying animal corvée taxes, and of unfair rules regarding irrigation and harvesting. The Reform Office also made a major reform that nationalized all the income from the dzongs and government estates. Kündeling also comments on how he became the Dzasa of Kündeling Labrang. And he describes how the Tibetan government's officials and soldiers gave the Khambas [in Eastern Tibet and Sichuan] a difficult time, prompting Panda Tobgye and Bapa Phüntso Wangyel to rise up and form an association called the Friends' Association. Through this organization, they attempted to drive out both the Chinese and the doji (Tibetan Governor-General), but they were unsuccessful.

### Tape 3  
**Q:**  How did you become the Kündeling Dzasa? Didn't you have to go to work for the government?   

**A:**  In Tibet, there were some big labrang of the regents, like Reting, Tsomönling, Tengyeling [Tib. bstan rgyas gling] and Kündeling. These are regarded as big labrangs. Normally, the lamas of these labrangs would be recognized as reincarnations, and [they would] enthrone them at the time of their childhood. They were also approved by the Dalai Lama. Nobody was allowed to say that justice is on my side and this is my candidate.   

**Q:**  Did they have to make the report through the Yigtsang?   

**A:**  Yes, the relevant labrang had to make the report through the Yigtsang. Under the lama, as for the main official in charge of the secular matters of the labrang, the dzasa was appointed. The candidates of the dzasa were chosen from among the best officials of the labrang, like the Dechungwa [Tib. lde chung ba] and Shabdöba. The plan of the candidates was submitted to the Dalai Lama through the Yigtsang. When the appointment order came down from the Dalai Lama, the dzasa also became the [third rank] official of the Tibetan government, as well as the in charge of the labrang. And he had to do whatever position was appointed by the government. It was not like a person from Kündeling going to the government like a representative. Similarly, all of the big labrang had their dzasa. Some other smaller monasteries, like Shelkar Chöde [Tib. shel dkar chos sde], had [fourth rank officials] the Uma Khenjung [Tib. dbu ma mkhan chung]. This was appointed from among the monks and he was the in charge of the monastery.   

**Q:**  After you became the dzasa, you belonged to the tsidrung (monk official's) rank, right?   

**A:**  Yes. Normally, we would sit at the head of the lay officials of the rank of dzasa, like Tsarong. This was like the Kalön Lama sitting at the head of the kalön. Since then, I had to go to attend the government meetings and do whatever work was assigned.   

**Q:**  What kind of work did you do after you became a dzasa?   

**A:**  In the 17-Point Agreement, it was written that reform should be implemented by the Tibetans through the agreement of the Tibetan government, and the people and the Zhongyang would not force us to do it. This was the cause of starting [the Reform Office]. Before that, since the Dalai Lama took the responsibility of the religious and political power, he put forward the idea of reforming the system of taxes, like the horse corvée, pack animal and ula, as well as the old loans that had become impossible to repay, and the worst, selling people [Tib. nyo tshong] to each other and exchanging people [Tib. mi brjes]. This was not like buying horses and mules [where one physically took the animal with you], it was just changing the person's serf owner status. As soon as he [the Dalai Lama] took political power, he said that and he was planning to put reforms into action, but soon after that, the Chinese arrived. Therefore, the government set up the Legjö Tsondu, the Reform Conference, and I was a representative to the Reform Conference. I worked there from the time it was started until 1959.   

**Q:**  This was the Legjö Legung, right?   

**A:**  Yes.   

**Q:**  What kind of reforms did you put into action?   

**A:**  The first and urgent was that there were a lot of grain loans to be paid to the gerpa, rich people, the traders and the monasteries. In the past, there weren't any banks, so lending grain loans was widespread in the towns and the countryside. There were many different kinds of loans and some of them charged a very high interest rate. People had to take the loans because they were in desperate situations and they got charged a very high interest [rate]. The highest interest rate was 25 percent and it was called shingadro [Tib. bzhi lnga 'gro]. It involved 1 khe of interest for 4 khe of principal. There was also drugdündro [Tib. drug bdun 'gro], which involved 1 khe of interest for 6 khe of principal [17%]. There was also gyegudro [Tib. brgyad dgu 'gro], which was 1 khe of interest for 8 khe of principal [12.5%],and kamcha jusur [Tib. skam cha bcu zur]. This was the lowest interest and was 10 percent, or 1 khe of interest for 10 khe of principal. This was regarded as no interest because the grain was wet at the beginning and would become less after drying for a year. Most of the debtors had to take a lot of loans and they were unable to repay them in autumn. For example, someone had to pay 10 khe of principal with 2 khe interest, and when they told the lenders that they couldn't repay it, they just erased the 10 khe in the pledge and wrote 12 khe. Then they had to pay the same high interest for 12 khe. So the loan became very big and even if the household didn't have the means to pay even 20-30 khe, and they didn't have enough grain for their family members' food, they would have had about 500-600-1000 khe of grain as the principal in the pledge. As for the lenders, it just became a number in the pledge. This made the debtors have a very hard time. At first, we dealt with the loans.   

**Q:**  Was that exclusively for the shungyupa?   

**A:**  No, we did an investigation for all the subjects under the Tibetan government, including the miser who belonged to the gerpa and the monasteries and government.   

**Q:**  At that time, didn't the gerpa [aristocracy] and monasteries say anything like they had jurisdiction over their own estates?   

**A:**  No, they didn't say anything because the Legjö [Reform Office] was being held and it was kind of powerful. The second great reform was done on the horse corvée and pack animals. We made the decision to pay a transportation fee and reduce a few of the horse corvée and pack animal obligations as the first step. Gradually it was planned to abolish the system of horse corvée and pack animal taxes. And we made the decision that no one was allowed to get the horse corvée and pack animal service unless they had a travel document [Tib. lam yig] with the seal of the Dalai Lama and the Kashag. The third reform concerned irrigation. Before that, the owner of the irrigation didn't let other farmers irrigate their lands on their own will, and they have to pay an irrigation fee to the owner. Sometimes, they blocked the irrigation saying that other people were not allowed to irrigate their lands. Also, when the crops were about to be harvested, the lord [Tib. dpon po] made some kind of rules and didn't let people harvest at their own wish, saying that the miser were not allowed to harvest their field before the lord's fields were harvested. There used to be many strange rules. All of these rules were eliminated. There were over 100 dzong and estates that belonged to the government. In the past, officials were appointed as the dzongpön, and some of these leased the dzongpön position [to another], and some of them didn't go there in person and just sent their servants. Therefore, they caused a severe hardship to the miser. Some of them also did wool trade and they made the rule that the other people were not allowed to buy wool from that place, except the county. They also did some bad things regarding the barley . All of these were eliminated and the government nationalized all the dzong and estates, and people were allowed to do trade according to their own will. The government also just collected the previous taxes and didn't impose any new taxes. Altogether, reforms were implemented on 20 items. The documents probably still exist. This was the most beneficial thing done at that time.   

**Q:**  Do you think the private office of the Dalai Lama has those documents?   

**A:**  It is possible. At that time, we set up the Reform Conference and we investigated and put them into action, so the government could get good income and the miser also didn't have to face hardships. In the past, for example, if I was the dzongpön of Shigatse, I collected all the taxes and things from the miser. But I didn't deliver the government the income that should have been delivered to the various treasuries like the Tsikhang, Laja or Tseja. After the government nationalized the dzong, the government got all of the incomes and there were a lot of surpluses. In the Reform Conference, Ngabö was the representative of the Kashag and there were all the drunyichemmo and the tsipön present. There were also representatives from each rank of the tsidrung and lay officials, as well as the representatives from the rupön and the gyagpön of the military regiments, the abbots of the Sera, Drepung and Ganden monasteries, and the representatives from each tratsang. Altogether there were around 60-70 people.   

**Q:**  When did the Legjö start?   

**A:**  It was started in 1954. It was in very good shape and people also liked it, and the government also got good income, so the Chinese were very jealous. The Chinese had the ambition to implement the reforms and get the benefits. When our reforms improved things, the Chinese kind of blocked the way. At the beginning, it was very good, but the Chinese caused some kind of hindrances. Therefore, later it kind of slightly declined. But, it didn't have much problem and we were able to do those changes.   

**Q:**  There were two different taxes. The nangtre and chitre. The miser also had to send horse corvée for the labrang, which was the nangtre, and in some places they also had to send the horse corvée for the government as the chitre. Did you also reform the system of the inner horse corvée [for their own lord]?   

**A:**  When the chitre were reformed, automatically, the nangtre would get reformed. As soon as the Dalai Lama took religious and political power, he had the idea of the reforms, and he also released all the prisoners from all over Tibet.   

**Q:**  What else did you do other than working in the Legjö? You also told me that you went to Kham, right?   

**A:**  When I was young, I was a tsidrung and I worked as staff officer [Tib. las bya] in the Yigtsang Office. Then I was appointed as a Shöndrön and also the liaison officer [Tib. sne shan] of the regent. After that, I became a tsendrön. At the time, my parents had faith towards Reting and when Reting became the regent, I was appointed as the liaison officer for Reting. My duty was to make connections between the government and Reting Labrang, and I also had to accompany the regent wherever he went and do all the preparations that should be done from the government side. After that, I was appointed as the shöndrön and I had to take care of the daily work, like granting audiences, for the regent. At that time, since the regent was holding the political power, all the work regarding politics was done through the shö ga (Regen's Secretariat). Later, I was appointed as the tsendrön. At one time, when the two regents, Reting and Taktra, had quarrels, I was among the pro-Reting group. After the Reting group lost that quarrel, the people who were pro-Reting had to face crises according to the customs then, and I was demoted from the post of the government official for a minor kind of matter. This was the time when I was working as a tsendrön. At that time, we had made up our mind that since our group lost, we would face crises. I was no longer a government official, but I was still an official of the Kündeling Labrang when I was younger. There was a labrang in Kham that belonged to Kündeling in Pagshö [Tib. dpa' shod]. This labrang was even bigger than the Kündeling Labrang in Lhasa. So then I was appointed as the chandzö of Pagshö and I went there before the Chinese arrived in Tibet.   

**Q:**  Where was this located?   

**A:**  It was near to Chamdo.   

**Q:**  It was on the upper side of the Yangtse River, right?   

**A:**  Yes, we were adjacent to Chamdo. In Tsawagang [Tib. tsha ba sgang] there were miser from both Pagshö and Chamdo. Similarly, in other places in that area, the other side of the mountain belonged to Traya [Tib. brag g.yab], and this belonged to Pagshö. The other side was Powo [Tib. spo bo] and this side also belonged to Pagshö. At the beginning, the Doji of Kham was Lhalu [Tib. lha klu] and the new one was Ngabö. Soon after that, the Chinese entered Tibet. One of the Chinese regiments also came through Pagshö. Some of them came from down there through Tsawagang and some of them came through the upper part from Xining. At that time, Ngabö was arrested at our border in the Drugugön [Tib. gru gu dgon] Monastery and a large number of Chinese came through that place.   

**Q:**  When you were in Pagshö, the Chinese had already arrived at the other side of the Yangtse River, right?   

**A:**  Yes.   

**Q:**  So they implemented a different policy in that place [Pagshö], right?   

**A:**  Yes, it was absolutely different. Chamdo was under the jurisdiction of the doji. The other side of the river was under Chinese jurisdiction before that. But, after that, they crossed the river and occupied Chamdo.   

**Q:**  There had probably been some kind of trouble between the Khambas and the Tibetan government in the past. Was it because the soldiers of the governor of Kham imposed a lot of taxes or what?   

**A:**  Yes, the Tibetan soldiers and the government officials who took about 10-15-20 servants with them made the miser face hardships. And the Khambas who were under Chinese control were also kind of different. They didn't like the Chinese and they also had a hard time when those areas were under the Tibetan government. They planned to rise up by themselves. People like Panda Tobgye [Tib. spom mda' stobs rgyas] and Bapa Phüntso Wangyel [Tib. 'ba' pa phun tshogs dbang rgyal] had set up a kind of [organization]. Do you know about that?   

**Q:**  No, I don't. Did they plan not to belong to both the Chinese and the Tibetan government?   

**A:**  Yes, they planned to rise up and drive out the Chinese and drive back the doji. They had some kind of association called the "Friends' Association [Tib. grogs po'i skyid sdug]" or something like that. At that time, the Tibetan government was suspicious of them, that they might rise up. The Chinese were also suspicious of them. Actually, they would not have been able to rise up. This was just their kind of opinion.  

**Q:**  In those early times, was the Tibetan border far down on the other side of the Yangtse River?   

**A:**  Yes, it was far down there. Have you been to Dartsedo?  

**Q:**  No, I was just 6 years old when I was in Lhasa.  

**A:**  The areas beyond the Yangtse River were called Gyade [Tib. rgya sde], the Chinese area, The areas on this side were called Böde [Tib. bod sde], the Tibetan area. The areas across the river were under the Derge King [Tib. sde dge rgyal po]. The Yangtse River flows in the middle of Derge. Some places like Derge Jomda [Tib. 'jo mda'] are in the Tibetan area. Actually, three-fourths of Derge are inn the Chinese area and one-fourth is in the Tibetan area. After passing Derge, you will reach the Ganzi Monastery [Tib. dkar mdzes] and the Targye [Tib. dar rgyas] Monastery. Those areas were called Trehor [Tib. tre hor] Khambas. When you go down from that place, you will reach Tau [Tib. rta'u]. Then you will reach Nyarong [Tib. nyag rong] and then Dartsedo. In the past, the Tibetan government soldiers controlled even Nyarong. This was not that early. It was the time of the Künsangtse Dzasa when he went to that place as the depön. He stayed in Nyarong for many years. Later, the Chinese gradually came up (reattacked) and finally, the Yangtse River became the border.  

**Q:**  At the time of the 5th Dalai Lama, the border was far down there, right?  

**A:**  Even Dartsedo was under Tibet.  

**Q:**  They might have sent dzongpön there, right?  

**A:**  Yes, they did.  

**Q:**  There were many dzong and estates, right?  

**A:**  Yes, you can find those in the Simla Agreement signed in the Wood-Tiger Year [Tib. shing stag sim la'i chings yig] [1914]. During our generation, Nyarong was under the Tibetan government. Dartsedo was even under the Chinese at that time. The Tibetan government was not that attentive to the borders and the Tibetan regiments who went to Kham made the miser face hardships. The miser kind of liked the Chinese, and they kind of collaborated and came up, and the territory was lost gradually. And in some places, some people stood on the Chinese side and some of them stood on the Tibetan side, and they made war. Actually, the present Ngabö, who was a son of Horkhang, came to Ngabö as a bridegroom. During the previous Ngabö Kalön, the territory beyond the Yangtse River was lost.  

**Q:**  How long did you stay in Pagshö?  

**A:**  I stayed for 4 years.  

**Q:**  At the beginning, when the Chinese came there, did they implement kind of a benign policy?  

**A:**  Yes, they implemented a benign [Tib. 'jam po] policy and they acted so well that people might have thought they were not human beings, that they were kind of Buddhas. The Chinese said, "The old Chinese like the Guomindang and the Manchu Emperor treated the Tibetans brutally and they made the people suffer. And we, the Communist Party, are like repaying the loans that they owed to the Tibetans. We came to serve the people, and they went to help the farmers to plow and harvest the fields." They went through the motions of not daring to put their tents up on the fields and they put their tents on the sides of the roads. They also sang the song with the words, "The Three Main Rules of Discipline and Eight Points of Attention [Tib. sgrig khrims chen po gsum dang do nang byed dgos pa brgyad]." According to this, they were not allowed to take even a needle from the miser. The miser were also telling us, "Aren't they so good?" But, Kündeling used to treat the miser kindly and when somebody bullied our miser, we would back our miser and handle them. So the miser were kind of glad.  

**Q:**  In 1956, the Preparatory Committee for the Tibet Autonomous Region was set up and the Dalai Lama also went to China and attended the People's Congress, right?  

**A:**  Yes, he went there as a representative to the People's Congress [Tib. rgyal yongs mi dmangs 'thus mi tshogs chen]. 
  

**Q:**  When people in foreign countries look from outside, it seemed that Tibet completely became under the Chinese control. At that time, why did the Dalai Lama go there? Couldn't he say that he was not going? At that time, he had the bodyguard regiment and all of those things in Lhasa.   

**A:**  There was a very good reason for him to go there because if you look in the 17-Point Agreement, it was written that they would set up a Military Administrative Committee in Tibet. Regarding this, Ngabö and the representatives talked a lot and they asked what this Military Administrative Committee was for. The Chinese said, "This is the committee in charge of the Tibet's military and politics." Then the Tibetan representatives said, "If this is so, on one hand it was said the titles and the authorities of the Dalai Lama and the Tibetan government would not be changed. But on the other hand, it was said that you are going to set up an office in charge of Tibet's military and politics. Would these two things become alike [Tib. 'dra po cig yong gi red pas]? We think that you are going to set it up though it is unnecessary. It probably would be the same [Tib. gcig pa min 'gro] if we eliminate one of the two, not changing the titles and the authorities of the Dalai Lama or setting up the Military Administrative Committee." This was said by the representative Trunyichemmo Lhautara. Regarding this matter, we also talked a lot in Tibet. Actually, it was an office for the military to control the politics. If the Chinese set up the Military Administrative Committee, this would contradict the saying that they would not change the politics of the Tibetan government. Therefore, people were very suspicious about this and the Chinese showed brutality on this matter and said that they were going to set it up. Regarding this matter, Lhautara Tsendrön also wrote about this in the life story of Lhautara. At that time, the Tibetans refused to set up the Military Administrative Committee. When the Dalai Lama went to China, they [the Chinese] said that the Dalai Lama was the leader of the representatives of Tibet attending the People's Congress. There were many other representatives like the Panchen Lama, Trijang [Tib. khri byang] Rimpoche, Che Jigme [Tib. ce 'jigs med], Yabshi Tsering Drolma [Tib. yab gzhis tshe ring sgrol ma], Panda Tobgye and Bapa Phüntso Wangyel.  There were many disputes at the meeting [in Lhasa] saying that the Dalai Lama shouldn't go to China. Do you know about that?   

**Q:**  No, I don't.   

**A:**  The meeting said a lot to the Dalai Lama, that he shouldn't go. Later, some people said that he should go and some people said, "He shouldn't go at all because the Chinese probably won't let him come back. They will just do something pleasantly and stop him from coming back. Even if they didn't do that, they will deceive him anyway and strangle him."   

**Q:**  Was that meeting held in Lhasa?   

**A:**  Yes, then we were talking about the Tibet Autonomous Region. What we didn't want was for many Chinese and soldiers to come to Tibet, which would cause hardships to the Tibetan people's lives, as well as to the Tibetan government. If the Military Administrative Committee would be set up, they would control both the military and the politics. When we talked about that to the Chinese officials in Lhasa, they were just saying that they would report it to the Zhongyang. So the Dalai Lama said, "I will go to China and meet Chairman Mao, and tell him that the things that the Tibetan people didn't agree to. Something will probably work out. Until now, we were talking with Zhang Jingwu and it was like sending messages through them, and the leaders of the Chinese and the leaders of Tibet haven't met. This time, if I go there and talk with the leaders, it is impossible that there will not be any positive result. I think there would be a positive result." This was the opinion of the Dalai Lama. That's how it was decided for the Dalai Lama to go to China. He went there and the People's Congress was held. After that, Chairman Mao put forward several points.
