<p><strong>Q:</strong>  From Lhasa?   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  Yes and a lot of cases that have been pending in Lhasa for years, sometimes <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. &#xF5E;&#xF63;&#xF0B;&#xF44;&#xF7C;] 1. a junior officer in the traditional Tibetan Army in charge of a unit of 25 soldiers (same as dingp&#xF6;n). 2. the two head disciplinary officials for all of Drepung monastery and for the M&#xF6;nlam Prayer Festival.">sheyngo</span> will decide that within two weeks.   </p>

<p><strong>Q:</strong>  One is Dalai Lama?   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  Yes, one is Dalai Lama and the other one&apos;s the regent...one and half persons, that&apos;s all.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  How do they say that in Tibetan?   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  [Tib. &#xF58;&#xF72;&#xF0B;&#xF44;&#xF0B;&#xF42;&#xF49;&#xF72;&#xF66;&#xF0B;&#xF40;&#xFB1;&#xF72;&#xF0B;&#xF42;&#xF7C;&#xF44;&#xF0B;&#xF63;&#xF0B;&#xF58;&#xF72;&#xF0B;&#xF42;&#xF45;&#xF72;&#xF42;&#xF0B;&#xF51;&#xF44;&#xF0B;&#xF55;&#xFB1;&#xF7A;&#xF51;&#xF0B;&#xF40;&#xF0B;&#xF58;&#xF0B;&#xF42;&#xF4F;&#xF7C;&#xF42;&#xF66;&#xF0B;&#xF58;&#xF7A;&#xF51;].   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  That&apos;s hysterical.   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  They don&apos;t care diplomat relations, they don&apos;t care anything, that&apos;s why they say the Nepalese, you remember in the history we have this incident of some one [called] Nyima [Tib. &#xF49;&#xF72;&#xF0B;&#xF58;] something and the thief called Kuma Kangtsug [Tib. &#xF62;&#xF90;&#xF74;&#xF53;&#xF0B;&#xF58;&#xF0B;&#xF62;&#xF90;&#xF44;&#xF0B;&#xF56;&#xF59;&#xF74;&#xF42;&#xF66;].   </p>

<p><strong>A:</strong>  Gyepo something and all this, they broke into the Nepalese Office and they even turned down the Nepalese down a couple times and they go and complain to the foreign office and all this but every decisions over. <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. &#xF5E;&#xF63;&#xF0B;&#xF44;&#xF7C;] 1. a junior officer in the traditional Tibetan Army in charge of a unit of 25 soldiers (same as dingp&#xF6;n). 2. the two head disciplinary officials for all of Drepung monastery and for the M&#xF6;nlam Prayer Festival.">sheyngo</span>&apos;s are strange, you know, one of the sheyngo&apos;s beats up this interpreter for Tan Guansan, the Chinese General, he lashed the interpreter of the Tan Guansan. I think this is 1950, not so late, I think 1955 or 56, somewhere around there.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  During the M&#xF6;nlam?   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  During the M&#xF6;nlam, Tan Guansan&apos;s probably number two or three persons in the Chinese whole setup. And he started riding bicycling near the courtyard, [of the Jokhang] khyamra [Tib. &#xF60;&#xF41;&#xFB1;&#xF58;&#xF66;&#xF0B;&#xF62;] and he got a hold of him and straightway, without talk, straightaway 50 lashes. By the time they complain goes up and down, he&apos;s already lashed down. And the <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. &#xF66;&#xFA1;&#xF7A;&#xF0B;&#xF56;&#xF0B;&#xF42;&#xF5E;&#xF74;&#xF44;] The name of the traditional Tibetan government.">dewashung</span> can say &quot;oh monks do all sorts of rash things.&quot; [Tib. &#xF42;&#xFB2;&#xFAD;&#xF0B;&#xF54;&#xF66;&#xF0B;&#xF50;&#xF7C;&#xF0B;&#xF63;&#xF7C;&#xF44;&#xF0B;&#xF58;&#xF7C;&#xF0B;&#xF63;&#xF7C;&#xF44;&#xF0B;&#xF56;&#xFB1;&#xF66;&#xF0B;&#xF54;&#xF0B;&#xF62;&#xF7A;&#xF51;] That&apos;s all, what can they do?   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  And that&apos;s what the thirteenth Dalai Lama told Sir Charles Bell, the monks are hard to control them, they do what they do.   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  Yes, they&apos;re really hard to control sometimes, they do whatever they want to do, even t the secretary, the cabinent secretary, Dumra&apos;s [Tib. &#xF63;&#xFA1;&#xF74;&#xF58;&#xF0B;&#xF62;] daughter was lashed by one of the <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. &#xF5E;&#xF63;&#xF0B;&#xF44;&#xF7C;] 1. a junior officer in the traditional Tibetan Army in charge of a unit of 25 soldiers (same as dingp&#xF6;n). 2. the two head disciplinary officials for all of Drepung monastery and for the M&#xF6;nlam Prayer Festival.">sheyngo</span> just for wearing some...I don&apos;t know...some shoes or something, some foreign made shoes [hin. jur ta].   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  When was that?   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  Ah. sometime in the fifties, I think in the fifties, and by the time Dumra came to know about it, he started to run to <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. &#xF58;&#xF42;&#xFB2;&#xF7C;&#xF53;&#xF0B;&#xF42;&#xF49;&#xF7A;&#xF62;&#xF0B;&#xF46;&#xF7A;&#xF53;&#xF0B;&#xF58;&#xF7C;] 1. The Dalai Lama&apos;s Lord Chamberlain. He was one of the most important monk officials in the Tibetan government and was the head of the Tse ga, the Dalai Lama&apos;s secretariat. 2. A high economic managerial position in some large monasteries.">dr&#xF6;nyerchemmo</span> and dr&#xF6;nyerchemmo didn&apos;t have time to do his tea as he had to rush and run to <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. &#xF5E;&#xF63;&#xF0B;&#xF44;&#xF7C;] 1. a junior officer in the traditional Tibetan Army in charge of a unit of 25 soldiers (same as dingp&#xF6;n). 2. the two head disciplinary officials for all of Drepung monastery and for the M&#xF6;nlam Prayer Festival.">sheyngo</span> to get stopped. You know, later in the fifties, the dr&#xF6;nyerchemmo has a lot of control over sheyngo, where he really tried to control sheyngo very tight. Because, otherwise, sheyngo misbehave a lot. So he have to run, personally, rather than send a message, or something, and by the time dr&#xF6;nyerchemmo, reached, the poor girl is already lashed 200 already out.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  On her buttoks?   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  Yes, 200 hundred, so, thats, I mean you can&apos;t take that back. What else can you do? <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. &#xF5E;&#xF63;&#xF0B;&#xF44;&#xF7C;] 1. a junior officer in the traditional Tibetan Army in charge of a unit of 25 soldiers (same as dingp&#xF6;n). 2. the two head disciplinary officials for all of Drepung monastery and for the M&#xF6;nlam Prayer Festival.">sheyngo</span> also knew that they are going to run [to stop them] so they do it quickly, decision quickly, lashed out quickly, throw it out quickly, finished by the time someone comes to.   </p>

<p><strong>A:</strong>  Well, there is a complaint here and there. it comes from here and there and you know some stolen this and that...and somebody else will come and say &quot;I&apos;m quite sure the thief is so and so.&quot; Probably They arrest so and so and lashed out. And lash them out and they say I&apos;m not alone...who else with you... and they go and catch all of them. So that&apos;s how they catch all the thieves. And the moment they catch the thief, more or less they get approved and they just gobble up all their property. The whole property.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  You mean like rugs and pots?   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  Rugs, pots, money, clothes, <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. &#xF55;&#xFB1;&#xF74;&#xF0B;&#xF54;] The traditional Tibetan men and women&apos;s dress. It is like a robe that is tied at the waist.

There&apos;s no time to sell at that moment. They just store it, that&apos;s all. And the moment you enter in the house, you know what the <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. &#xF51;&#xF42;&#xF7A;&#xF0B;&#xF42;&#xF61;&#xF7C;&#xF42;] Monk assistant to the disciplinary official (geg&#xF6;) in monasteries.">geyog</span> will do?

That&apos;s what they do. Thats what they do.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  You mean, if they go to a monks house?   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  Whoever it is , if you happen to be a thief, they have to be a thief. Everything is going to be taken anyway so will be take.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  But they couldn&apos;t go to just a regular person&apos;s house and take the stuffs?   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  No, no, not like that. Unless its a complaint in the court and confirmed. Then they do that very often. Then, if the thief is caught, first thing they remove are the watches and then their thumbring and earing and everything they take it away. And the <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. &#xF5E;&#xF63;&#xF0B;&#xF44;&#xF7C;] 1. a junior officer in the traditional Tibetan Army in charge of a unit of 25 soldiers (same as dingp&#xF6;n). 2. the two head disciplinary officials for all of Drepung monastery and for the M&#xF6;nlam Prayer Festival.">sheyngo</span> will inquire &quot;Where did earring go?&quot; Someone says &quot;I don&apos;t know, the <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. &#xF51;&#xF42;&#xF7A;&#xF0B;&#xF42;&#xF61;&#xF7C;&#xF42;] Monk assistant to the disciplinary official (geg&#xF6;) in monasteries.">geyog</span> get it. That&apos;s what happens.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  So that can be very profitable.   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  Oh yes, Very profitable. They make more money in Tsongj&#xF6;. And then they also go through this protectors [Tib. &#xF63;&#xFB7;], they will go the protectors and say, &quot;oh there are a lot of theives, so please help us to catch them. We heard there&apos;s a lot of thieves going on there so please we&apos;ve got a few days left, please help us to catch them&quot;. Sometimes, those, they will offer advise you know, saying why don&apos;t you do this, this and this.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  Protectors, meaning the,   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  The oracle.   </p>

<p><strong>A:</strong>  Yes. some of them will say, &quot;Yes, do this and do that&quot; and they help a lot.   </p>

This is another total set of all this, a total different world there again at work.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  So that&apos;s Drepung, or did you say <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. &#xF56;&#xFB3;&#xF7C;&#xF0B;&#xF42;&#xF66;&#xF63;&#xF0B;&#xF42;&#xFB3;&#xF72;&#xF44;] One of the main colleges in Drepung Monastery.">Loseling</span>?   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  Drepung.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  And like Sera would have different ones?   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  Sera would have different ones, Sera will have Thawo [Tib. &#xF50;&#xF74;&#xF56;&#xF0B;&#xF60;&#xF7C;&#xF42;], whole different set up there.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  Like Shungden [Tib. &#xF64;&#xF74;&#xF42;&#xF66;&#xF0B;&#xF63;&#xFA1;&#xF53;] and that, who   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  Shungden doesn&apos;t belong to any one of those big monasteries, no...new comer.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  New comer . But these ones like Gadong. Say they are supposed to be monks too but they&apos;re not monks?   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  You mean the oracle?   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  Yes.   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  Sometimes they&apos;re monks, sometimes they&apos;re not. Doesn&apos;t matter but...whether you are monk or not monk, you wear monks robes.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  When you do this?   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  No, everyday.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  Well, can they get married?   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  Yes, the famous Gadong Oracle has four or five sons.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  And then he has like a <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. &#xF56;&#xFB3;&#xF0B;&#xF56;&#xFB2;&#xF44;] 1. The property/wealth owning corporate entity of an incarnate lama. 2. The property/wealth owning corporate entity of the Panchen Lama.">labrang</span> or what? I mean that he inherits or what?   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  No, nothing, nothing.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  How is someone like that picked? Is that under the control of the monastery?   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  No, whoever get the trance and the correct trance. And that one can be picked it up, it doesn&apos;t matter, whoever you meet, you have nothing to do with that monastery. You get a trance and it proves to be the correct one.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  How would you prove it?   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  Well, there are under lot of different tests for that. Another already approved oracle, a different lamas, different, like a <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. &#xF42;&#xF53;&#xF66;&#xF0B;&#xF46;&#xF74;&#xF44;] 1. One of the main protector deities of the Tibetan government and the Dalai Lama. 2. The monastery in which the medium of Nechung resides that is located just east of Drepung Monastery.">Nechung</span> and Gadong, I think has to be approved by the Dalai Lama and others, I don&apos;t think they have to be approved by the Dalai Lama. But in the case of the Tenma it is hereditary-- always the daughters of the family got Tenma.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  So the oracle is a female?   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  The oracle is female in the Tenma case, the oracle is a female. I think Thamba Simkhang [Tib. &#xF51;&#xF53;&#xF0B;&#xF60;&#xF56;&#xF42;&#xF0B;&#xF42;&#xF5F;&#xF72;&#xF58;&#xF0B;&#xF41;&#xF44;].   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  Tenma is spelled how?   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  [Tib. &#xF56;&#xF66;&#xF9F;&#xF53;&#xF0B;&#xF58;] Ah...in Drepung, up there, there is a little, now I believe there&apos;s a little garden, there, that&apos;s Tenma house.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  Outside the wall?   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  Outside, quite a way out. Sort of upper part there, on the other side of...that&apos;s hereditary, Tenma.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  Is that the only woman?   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  No, Pushar [Tib. &#xF55;&#xF74;&#xF0B;&#xF64;&#xF62;], another one of them called Pushar, that&apos;s also a woman. There are quite a lot of women there now.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  Okay, so that&apos;s a little bit about the discipline, let me get back to the sh&#xF6;ndre. So, I still am not quite sure how this goes. You (enter) the monastery about eight or nine years old...just a regular monk...now how would you usually do it, let&apos;s say, ummm, why don&apos;t you explain if you were a parent and you had a son, how this would all work?   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  You want to enter monastery?   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  Yes.   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  The way you enter is first you look for somebody who take you, a gegen. Not necessarily the teacher who&apos;ll teach you, but who&apos;ll be responsible for you in the <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. &#xF41;&#xF44;&#xF0B;&#xF5A;&#xF53;] A monastic residential unit in which monks from specific geographic areas lived. These were corporate entities with property and internal officials. Some large khamtsen had smaller subordinate units called mi tshan. Khamtsen were part of tratsang (colleges). For example, Hamdong Khamtsen was part of Gomang College in Drepung Monastery.">khamtsen</span> or tratsang.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  You have to have one of those.   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  You have to have one of those. So that fellow will say well, he&apos;s been one of my <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. &#xF51;&#xF42;&#xF7A;&#xF0B;&#xF55;&#xFB2;&#xF74;&#xF42;] 1. Student. 2. Disciple. 3. Commonly the name for monks living with a gegen or teacher. These are more like wards than real disciples.">gidru</span> and I&apos;m going to enter him.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  Well, how would you find someone like that?   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  Through friends, through families, and then also there are systems like you know, different villages belongs to different khamtsen. You know, through the different contacts. That&apos;s a very very strong system. Like in Nyare Khamtsen, the whole Traya [Tib. &#xF56;&#xFB2;&#xF42;&#xF0B;&#xF42;&#xF61;&#xF56;], Gonjo [Tib. &#xF42;&#xF7C;&#xF0B;&#xF60;&#xF47;&#xF7C;], belongs to Nyare. Mangkham [Tib. &#xF66;&#xFA8;&#xF62;&#xF0B;&#xF41;&#xF58;&#xF66;] belongs to Phukang [Tib. &#xF55;&#xF74;&#xF0B;&#xF41;&#xF44;]. And sertain portions belongs to Tsha [Tib. &#xF5A;&#xF0B;&#xF56;], or <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. &#xF68;&#xF0B;&#xF58;&#xF51;&#xF7C;] One of the three main Tibetan sub-ethnic areas. It is located in the northeast of the Tibetan Plateau mostly in today&apos;s Qinghai Province. A person from Amdo is called an Amdowa.">Amdo</span> goes to <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. &#xF66;&#xF92;&#xF7C;&#xF0B;&#xF58;&#xF44;] One of the large colleges in Drepung Monastery.">Gomang</span> and also divide where which part of the Amdo they go.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  So Nyare Khamtsen is all Khampas then?   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  Mostly Khampas, and then are are like from the central Tibet, &#xDC;ba [Tib. &#xF51;&#xF56;&#xF74;&#xF66;&#xF0B;&#xF54;], who comes into Nyare Khamtsen, actually have a personal friend, somebody, and who is will say, &quot;Alright, I&apos;ll take your son.&quot; And then, they say &quot;OK, I&apos;m going to join the Nyare Khamtsen.&quot;   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  I see.   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  You can do that.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  Even if you are not from the normal area?   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  Even if you are not from that area...you can do that if you choose...provided that the other side does not really raise hell out of it.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  The other side, like normally the &#xDC;ba would be from where?   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  Depends. Like if you are from <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. &#xF42;&#xF59;&#xF44;] One of the major sub-areas of Tibet that is located in southwest Tibet. Its main city is Shigatse.">Tsang</span> [Tib. &#xF42;&#xF59;&#xF44;] it will be for Tsangpa, [Tib. &#xF42;&#xF59;&#xF44;&#xF0B;&#xF54;] if you are from Kongpo you are for Kongpo, Lhasa, it depends...each <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. &#xF66;&#xF90;&#xF74;&#xF0B;&#xF51;&#xFB2;&#xF42;] 1.

<p><strong>A:</strong>  Yea. Each one of those.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  No kidding.   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  Everybody has his own.   </p>

<p><strong>A:</strong>  I think Surkhang probably belongs to Tsangpa.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  There is Ngari [Tib. &#xF58;&#xF44;&#xF60;&#xF0B;&#xF62;&#xF72;&#xF66;] Khamtsen?   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  Yes, there is Ngari in Gomang. In <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. &#xF56;&#xFB3;&#xF7C;&#xF0B;&#xF42;&#xF66;&#xF63;&#xF0B;&#xF42;&#xFB3;&#xF72;&#xF44;] One of the main colleges in Drepung Monastery.">Loseling</span> there must be Tsangba. Tsarong [Tib. &#xF5A;&#xF0B;&#xF62;&#xF7C;&#xF44;] is Tsangba, Surkhang maybe not.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  But there isn&apos;t anything called like &#xDC;ba?   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  No, there is no <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. &#xF41;&#xF44;&#xF0B;&#xF5A;&#xF53;] A monastic residential unit in which monks from specific geographic areas lived.

<p><strong>Q:</strong>  Why would they care?   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  Depends, if the family&apos;s a wealthy family and sort of, you are losing your support. That&apos;s why they care.

<p><strong>A:</strong>  Not in this time.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  I see   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  This becomes a sort of vinaya rule, the monk&apos;s rules, that comes much later or even before. That&apos;s different matter.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  So this is, he puts the seal on?   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  He puts his seal on the list when he comes into the entrance and so and so gidr&#xFC; and then he is responsible thereafter.

Totally responsible for the tunes and things and umdze can make a lot of mistake, that&apos;s true. But then they are there to correct immediately.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  I see.   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  For example, the present, when we lived, 1959, the <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. &#xF56;&#xFB3;&#xF7C;&#xF0B;&#xF42;&#xF66;&#xF63;&#xF0B;&#xF42;&#xFB3;&#xF72;&#xF44;] One of the main colleges in Drepung Monastery.">Loseling</span> umdze who became <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. &#xF5A;&#xF7C;&#xF42;&#xF66;&#xF0B;&#xF46;&#xF7A;&#xF53;] The main assembly hall of a monastery. The assembly hall for the monastery as a whole.">tsogchen</span> umdze in India, didn&apos;t know anything about it except he had very good voice. So he doesn&apos;t have even words, few words, but beyond that he doesn&apos;t even know. So he only know how to start. Well, very good voice, he start &quot;oommmmm&quot; thick voice and they pick up like &quot;wawawawaong wawawawaong&quot; and he doesn&apos;t have words.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  So, why did they pick him as?   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  Because his voice...and because of his looks, good voice. Pool all together. But the core group there is the d&#xF6;nsang kesang, they really take the tune, they shape it.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  Is that considered prestigeous in the monastery?   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  I don&apos;t think so. It&apos;s not that prestigeous either. But without that, they can never be function. No way.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  So of the prestigeous, they most do what - the <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. &#xF51;&#xF54;&#xF7A;&#xF0B;&#xF46;&#xF0B;&#xF56;] A monk studying the monastic philosophical curriculum. A scholar monk.">pechawa</span>?   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  They are not really prestigeous either. No, I mean they are sort of (one) of them but don&apos;t really see anything as prestigeous.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  So what&apos;s prestigeous in the monastery?   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  Geshe, one thing, and uh, and the officials beside the <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. &#xF66;&#xFA4;&#xFB2;&#xF74;&#xF63;&#xF0B;&#xF66;&#xF90;&#xF74;] An incarnate lama.">tr&#xFC;ku</span> and ch&#xF6;ndze. So the ultimate goal of the d&#xF6;nsang kesang is to be umdze. But then sometimes you know some funny thing happen and umdze will be changed.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  Like umdze is for how many years?   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  Oh, I think they remain there, though the <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. &#xF58;&#xF41;&#xF53;&#xF0B;&#xF54;&#xF7C;] The abbot of a monastery or monastic college.">khempo</span>, everytime, the khempo will decide, but khempo, everytime they decide, I think 6 years, I don&apos;t think they change much. When the new khempo comes in, there will can I continue, and they say yea, they will continue, so probably, I think, automatically. But then if something happens to the present umdze, then there is choice of new umdze, then khempo has lot of to do. But <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. &#xF51;&#xF42;&#xF7A;&#xF0B;&#xF66;&#xF90;&#xF7C;&#xF66;] The main disciplinary official in a monastic college (tratsang).">geg&#xF6;</span> are appointed by khempo, but not like this, I think like 6 years after they appoint, its very strange.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  What do you mean?   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  Khempo&apos;s period is six years...so this <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. &#xF58;&#xF41;&#xF53;&#xF0B;&#xF54;&#xF7C;] The abbot of a monastery or monastic college.">khempo</span>, the moment he comes in, he will try to appoint one <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. &#xF51;&#xF42;&#xF7A;&#xF0B;&#xF66;&#xF90;&#xF7C;&#xF66;] The main disciplinary official in a monastic college (tratsang).">geg&#xF6;</span> every year, but not for that year, probably for the next two or three years.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  Why?   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  Well, because, it&apos;s only that when he join in that the previous <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. &#xF58;&#xF41;&#xF53;&#xF0B;&#xF54;&#xF7C;] The abbot of a monastery or monastic college.">khempo</span> had already appointed one or two <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. &#xF51;&#xF42;&#xF7A;&#xF0B;&#xF66;&#xF90;&#xF7C;&#xF66;] The main disciplinary official in a monastic college (tratsang).">geg&#xF6;</span> already there.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  Really.   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  Yeah, that happens. So then the   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  That <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. &#xF58;&#xF41;&#xF53;&#xF0B;&#xF54;&#xF7C;] The abbot of a monastery or monastic college.">khempo</span> would really have to check on that system.   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  Yes, and this <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. &#xF58;&#xF41;&#xF53;&#xF0B;&#xF54;&#xF7C;] The abbot of a monastery or monastic college.">khempo</span> get his chance to push it a little now.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  But the <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. &#xF51;&#xF42;&#xF7A;&#xF0B;&#xF66;&#xF90;&#xF7C;&#xF66;] The main disciplinary official in a monastic college (tratsang).">geg&#xF6;</span> is only for one year.   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  One year.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  One year at a time but the umdze is like?   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  Lifetime.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  Lifetime, so theres not much opportunity for the d&#xF6;nsang kesang to go up?   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  No there are not. For they are not that well-known, and also its a small group who is really important, one of the most important ones, but they, sort of, people pay no attention about that.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  And they have separate teaching and   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  They have separate system.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  So how does somebody say, &quot;I&apos;m going to become d&#xF6;nsang-kesang.&quot;   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  Do whatever you want to do, start picking up yourself.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  Like at what age would people start separating out?   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  Oh, there&apos;s not even age limit, they will go anytime. Anytime. Five, I don&apos;t think the old ones change much but something like twentys and thirtys and teens too. So...somebody who had very nice voice or something, extraordinary, then, of course, the d&#xF6;nsang kesang will approach them and then umdze would approach them, even to the extent of <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. &#xF58;&#xF41;&#xF53;&#xF0B;&#xF54;&#xF7C;] The abbot of a monastery or monastic college.">khempo</span> will even approach...it may happen. But otherwise, most of them either if you have a friend in the d&#xF6;nsang kesang you go with them and you become d&#xF6;nsang kesang and I think they maintain a separate list also. Separate list also.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  Is there any advantages like special <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. &#xF60;&#xF42;&#xFB1;&#xF7A;] Alms given to monks.">gye</span> or anything like that?   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  No nothing. nothing. They have more problems. They have to meet separately more and practice much more than we have to meet and practice, much more.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  So, they&apos;re more concerned with the sounds than the words, what the words mean.   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  They&apos;re not concerned much with what words mean, they simply concerned with the sounds where to take high...and it has to be &quot;thick&quot; voice or &quot;thin&quot; voice or whether it is &quot;oo&quot; sound or &quot;ee&quot; sound or whatever...and how high should be, how low should be, that&apos;s what they do. That is there job, they have to memorize a lot, because you know in the monasteries the readings, they don&apos;t read books, everything have to come out by heart. And these are the people who are responsible because everyone will say one hundred different things. Someone saying yes this is right, and something wrong thing but the core group is there to (pick) up... They really   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  You mean like at <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. &#xF58;&#xF44;&#xF0B;&#xF47;] The morning tea served to monks from all the monastic colleges at the main prayer assembly hall.">mangja</span>?   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  Yes, every meeting they have, every prayer they say they memorize and they have to come, they have to come. If they&apos;re not there, they really come, they are really ones who come to <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. &#xF42;&#xFB2;&#xFAD;&#xF0B;&#xF47;] The prayer session sponsored by the tratsang (college) at which tea was served to its monks who attended.">traja</span>, <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. &#xF58;&#xF44;&#xF0B;&#xF47;] The morning tea served to monks from all the monastic colleges at the main prayer assembly hall.">mangja</span>, they don&apos;t come much to the <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. &#xF46;&#xF7C;&#xF66;&#xF0B;&#xF62;] The special grove (&quot;dharma grove&quot;) in monasteries where monks formally met to practice debating.">ch&#xF6;ra</span>.

But then they, the <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. &#xF66;&#xF90;&#xF74;&#xF0B;&#xF62;&#xF72;&#xF58;] A religious prayer service for monks.">kurim</span> [Tib. &#xF66;&#xF90;&#xF74;&#xF0B;&#xF62;&#xF72;&#xF58;], they have to come. In the <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. &#xF49;&#xF72;&#xF53;&#xF0B;&#xF46;&#xF7C;&#xF66;] A mid-day study session in monasteries.">nyinch&#xF6;</span>, they have the singing.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  The <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. &#xF66;&#xF90;&#xF74;&#xF0B;&#xF62;&#xF72;&#xF58;] A religious prayer service for monks.">kurim</span> is what?   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  The <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. &#xF66;&#xF90;&#xF74;&#xF0B;&#xF62;&#xF72;&#xF58;] A religious prayer service for monks.">kurim</span> is the evening ch&#xF6;ra.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  Evening ch&#xF6;ra. Why do they have to come there?   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  Oh, that is mostly praying, a lot of singing goes on, a tremendous amount of singing.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  Chanting?   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  Chanting, a tremendous amount of chanting.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  I see, so they have to come to that.   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  They really do, that is their core. And then some difficult, complicated chanting, maybe probably, see it only few of them chanting, nobody else.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  Do, like, does the teacher, does your <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. &#xF51;&#xF42;&#xF7A;&#xF0B;&#xF62;&#xF92;&#xF53;] 1. Teacher in a school. 2. In monastic settings it also refers to an adult monk who acted as a guardian to a younger monk. In such cases, the younger monk typically lived in the gegen&apos;s apartment (shag). In monasteries, however, it could also mean a real teacher, or the monk who served as the guarantor for a new monk.">gegen</span>, usually is he the one who says, &quot;Why don&apos;t you do this?&quot;   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  He can do, he can say it but sometimes the <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. &#xF51;&#xF42;&#xF7A;&#xF0B;&#xF62;&#xF92;&#xF53;] 1. Teacher in a school. 2.

You move up and down. Changes tremendously.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  Now, how do you get into the <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. &#xF5A;&#xF7C;&#xF42;&#xF66;&#xF0B;&#xF46;&#xF7A;&#xF53;] The main assembly hall of a monastery. The assembly hall for the monastery as a whole.">tsogchen</span> level or the <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. &#xF42;&#xFB2;&#xFAD;&#xF0B;&#xF5A;&#xF44;] A &quot;college&quot; within a monastery, for example, in Drepung Monastery there were four main tratsang: Gomang, Loseling, Deyang and Ngagpa. These tratsang were property owning corporate entities and included monks who were organized into residential dormitories called Khamtsen.">tratsang</span> level, I mean how does that work? You are in the <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. &#xF41;&#xF44;&#xF0B;&#xF5A;&#xF53;] A monastic residential unit in which monks from specific geographic areas lived. These were corporate entities with property and internal officials. Some large khamtsen had smaller subordinate units called mi tshan. Khamtsen were part of tratsang (colleges).

The assembly hall for the monastery as a whole.">tsogchen</span>. Tsogchen called group too and tsogchen has a different tune, completely by itself. So you took interest in that.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  Do people ask you to come and join, is that what happens?   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  Some people do, some people do, they ask were going there, well why don&apos;t you come in? Try to see if you can memorize that and this and that, some people have interest, a personal interest to you.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  But there&apos;s no more   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  There&apos;s no more financial benefit.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  If you&apos;re in all three or if you&apos;re just in one.   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  There&apos;s nothing. There&apos;s not at all, absolutely no financial benefit. No exemption (from) anything.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  So just personal interest.   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  Just personal interest. And this is the hard one.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  So how many people, do you think, do that? There aren&apos;t many pechawa.   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  Pechawa a lot, right...I think d&#xF6;nsang kesang relatively not so much, I think about 40- fifty.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  In all of Drepung?   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  Probably, that&apos;s a very small group. But if its not there, you can not have it. That&apos;s that. So when it goes very low category, then <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. &#xF42;&#xFB2;&#xFAD;&#xF0B;&#xF5A;&#xF44;] A &quot;college&quot; within a monastery, for example, in Drepung Monastery there were four main tratsang: Gomang, Loseling, Deyang and Ngagpa.

<p><strong>Q:</strong>  Now, are the musicians like that too, the people who learn the instruments? Is that the same thing, you have to have them too?   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  Well, in the case of Drepung, they don&apos;t use any instrument at all. No.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  None?   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  None whatsoever.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  No <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. &#xF62;&#xF92;&#xFB1;&#xF0B;&#xF42;&#xFB3;&#xF72;&#xF44;] A clarinet type of wind instrument played by monks in religious services.">gyaling</span> [Tib. &#xF62;&#xF92;&#xFB1;&#xF0B;&#xF42;&#xFB3;&#xF72;&#xF44;] nothing?   </p>

<p><strong>A:</strong>  That&apos;s just the <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. &#xF56;&#xFB3;&#xF7C;&#xF0B;&#xF42;&#xF66;&#xF63;&#xF0B;&#xF42;&#xFB3;&#xF72;&#xF44;] One of the main colleges in Drepung Monastery.">Loseling</span> system.   </p>

<p><strong>Q:</strong>  I see, what about the other great monastic seats?   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. &#xF66;&#xF7A;&#xF0B;&#xF62;&#xF0B;&#xF56;&#xFB1;&#xF7A;&#xF66;] The Je College in Sera Monastery.">Sera Je</span> and <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. &#xF66;&#xFA8;&#xF51;] The Mey College of Sera Monastery.">Mey</span>, I don&apos;t think they use it, no....Ganden, yes, Shartse, Changtse [Tib. &#xF64;&#xF62;&#xF0B;&#xF62;&#xFA9;&#xF7A;&#xF0B;&#xF56;&#xFB1;&#xF44;&#xF0B;&#xF62;&#xFA9;&#xF7A;] they both do this.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  Is there any theoretical reason why that&apos;s true?   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. &#xF56;&#xFB3;&#xF7C;&#xF0B;&#xF42;&#xF66;&#xF63;&#xF0B;&#xF42;&#xFB3;&#xF72;&#xF44;] One of the main colleges in Drepung Monastery.">Loseling</span> used to say we are a tshenyi <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. &#xF42;&#xFB2;&#xFAD;&#xF0B;&#xF5A;&#xF44;] A &quot;college&quot; within a monastery, for example, in Drepung Monastery there were four main tratsang: Gomang, Loseling, Deyang and Ngagpa. These tratsang were property owning corporate entities and included monks who were organized into residential dormitories called Khamtsen.">tratsang</span>, and that&apos;s why. But on the other hand in the Loseling g&#xF6;nkhang [Tib. mgon kgang] [the chaple where the protective deities are kept] people do it that there, another set of gombo [Tib. &#xF58;&#xF42;&#xF7C;&#xF53;&#xF0B;&#xF54;&#xF7C;&#xF0B;&#xF56; ] [monks doing prayers in the g&#xF6;nkhang] set up again, then they&apos;re learn instrument and <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. &#xF42;&#xF4F;&#xF7C;&#xF62;&#xF0B;&#xF58;] A ritual offering made from tsamba and water.">torma</span> making everything. And uh   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  But those would be (people) from Ngagpa [Tib. &#xF66;&#xF94;&#xF42;&#xF66;&#xF0B;&#xF54;]?   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  No, a part of Loseling.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  A part of <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. &#xF56;&#xFB3;&#xF7C;&#xF0B;&#xF42;&#xF66;&#xF63;&#xF0B;&#xF42;&#xFB3;&#xF72;&#xF44;] One of the main colleges in Drepung Monastery.">Loseling</span>?   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  A part of Loseling.but its in a smaller chapel they are meeting; its not in general meetings they are meeting at all.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  And how are people picked for that?   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  Some people who from already having little knowledge of ritual here and there, some sort of one picks the other up and get into that category again. There is no set up pattern. Many of those monks you can&apos;t forget one thing is that they come from another monastery, so some of the already have pretraining and a little bit of knowledge, so that have interest to get into that.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  So then in your <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. &#xF5A;&#xF7C;&#xF58;&#xF0B;&#xF47;] The name of the khamtsen&apos;s prayer assembly meetings at which tea was served.">tsomja</span> and those things, they&apos;d never play instruments? What about the bell, do they have a bell [Tib. &#xF51;&#xFB2;&#xF72;&#xF63;&#xF0B;&#xF56;&#xF74;]?   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  No, no.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  Damaru, [the small hand drum]?   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  No.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  Nothing?   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  No, nothing. It was a site separate than usual where you may do it. But none whatsoever in general.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  So when, like the monks do like their own private prayers, they don&apos;t do it all?   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  They may.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  They may, because I saw monks always doing with the sound &quot;ting ting&quot;   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  Yes. But in Drepung, you can not.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  You can not?   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  You can not, you can not, but we <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. &#xF66;&#xFA4;&#xFB2;&#xF74;&#xF63;&#xF0B;&#xF66;&#xF90;&#xF74;] An incarnate lama.">tr&#xFC;ku</span>, we have to give, one of the exemption is you can play damaru all the time.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  Well, then, why do people use them, what&apos;s the difference between using them and not using them?   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  Ha. At certain level, you know, I mean, after you out from there and then you can use it.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  You mean its a higher level not to use it or to use it?   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  The higher level later, I mean later, this is the beginning of study, more for study rather than playing the instrument.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  So the higher you get, the more people use damaru?   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  Yes. But that&apos;s why you find a lot of <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. &#xF51;&#xF42;&#xF7A;&#xF0B;&#xF64;&#xF7A;&#xF66;] An advanced degree earned by scholar monks.">geshe</span> who don&apos;t know how to use it damaru, you give them damaru and they do all sorts of funny things. They act like a monkey.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  Because they never even use it?   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  They never knew how to do it, they never had to, all of a sudden they&apos;ve got it in hand and they don&apos;t know what to do and in damaru they go (sounds like a galloping horse)...   </p>

<p><strong>Q:</strong>  That should be couple of hundres in that open courtyard?   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  Yes. Open courtyard, they probably, like two (and a) half line. Two whole lines.

<p><strong>Q:</strong>  By the people in this <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. &#xF64;&#xF42;&#xF0B;&#xF5A;&#xF44;] 1. The household or family of a monk that consisted of multiple monks. 2. The apartment of a monk household.">shagtsang</span> or everybody?   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  In the <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. &#xF64;&#xF42;&#xF0B;&#xF5A;&#xF44;] 1. The household or family of a monk that consisted of multiple monks. 2. The apartment of a monk household.">shagtsang</span>. And then you know, if the shagtsang is a big one, then it influences others and they also call them <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. &#xF66;&#xF90;&#xF74;&#xF0B;&#xF44;&#xF7C;] An honorific term of address for aristocratic officials. It is something like, &quot;Your Excellency.&quot;">kung&#xF6;</span> too.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  No kidding.   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  Yes. Phara [Tib. &#xF55;&#xF0B;&#xF62;] Jiso is one example. In there, there are two <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. &#xF66;&#xF90;&#xF74;&#xF0B;&#xF44;&#xF7C;] An honorific term of address for aristocratic officials. It is something like, &quot;Your Excellency.&quot;">kung&#xF6;</span>. Call them senior kung&#xF6; dreba [Tib. &#xF56;&#xF42;&#xFB2;&#xF7A;&#xF66;&#xF0B;&#xF54;] and junior kung&#xF6; sh&#xF6;nba [Tib. &#xF42;&#xF5E;&#xF7C;&#xF53;&#xF0B;&#xF54;].   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  But they are not <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. &#xF66;&#xF90;&#xF74;&#xF0B;&#xF51;&#xFB2;&#xF42;] 1. A member of the lay aristocracy. 2. Title for government lay and monk officials. 3. A name occasionally used for the top leaders/officials in a monastery.">kudrak</span> or anything.   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  No, they are just shagtsang. But they call them kung&#xF6;.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  So they would have a lot of rooms, a big house, and a lot of money?   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  Oh, they would have a lot of money. Then you know they have this, even this Phara Jiso, in order to not clash, and probably they are looking after the interests of different things, one would look after the interest of northern activity and southern activity business and then they are meeting among themselves and then they meet and decide and set up the policy, otherwise they are function independent. It is a, you can say, its almost a corporation type of deal.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  But it could also be that they have like relatives?   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  Oh, they have relatives, that both <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. &#xF66;&#xF90;&#xF74;&#xF0B;&#xF44;&#xF7C;] An honorific term of address for aristocratic officials. It is something like, &quot;Your Excellency.&quot;">kung&#xF6;</span> have relatives, will join in and become junior things like <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. &#xF42;&#xFB2;&#xFAD;&#xF0B;&#xF5A;&#xF44;] A &quot;college&quot; within a monastery, for example, in Drepung Monastery there were four main tratsang: Gomang, Loseling, Deyang and Ngagpa. These tratsang were property owning corporate entities and included monks who were organized into residential dormitories called Khamtsen.">tratsang</span> nyertsang and start coming up (in rank), I have seen it. So by that generation, there probably be four or five kung&#xF6;...so that&apos;s what happens, so when there are more kung&#xF6; and each one of the kung&#xF6; will take a line and separate, and they&apos;re totally responsible-- each individual is responsible for his own line..however   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  Oh really. You mean, there isn&apos;t like one person at the top who says, &quot;yes,&quot; &quot;no,&quot; &quot;we shouldn&apos;t buy this,&quot; &quot;we shouldn&apos;t sell this.&quot;   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  Yeah, but the person, one is very efficient they may respect, but even then they may decide the other way, this very often happen in the shagtsang.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  Who would [end of the tape]   </p>
