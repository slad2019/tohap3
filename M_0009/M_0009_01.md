**Q:**  July 23rd. Interview with Gelek Rimpoche. Today he is going to tell me all about the structure of Drepung Monastery.   

**Q:**  How many <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. གྲྭ་ཚང] A &quot;college&quot; within a monastery, for example, in Drepung Monastery there were four main tratsang: Gomang, Loseling, Deyang and Ngagpa. These tratsang were property owning corporate entities and included monks who were organized into residential dormitories called Khamtsen.">tratsang</a> (colleges) are there in Drepung Monastery?   

**A:**  In Drepung, originally there were supposed to be seven <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. གྲྭ་ཚང] A &quot;college&quot; within a monastery, for example, in Drepung Monastery there were four main tratsang: Gomang, Loseling, Deyang and Ngagpa. These tratsang were property owning corporate entities and included monks who were organized into residential dormitories called Khamtsen.">tratsang</a>. However, later several tratsang could not function as fully as a tratsang, but though about three or four times a year they meet and function. But they still had abbots. And they more or less became the abbot of the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. བླ་བྲང] 1. The property/wealth owning corporate entity of an incarnate lama. 2. The property/wealth owning corporate entity of the Panchen Lama.">labrang</a>, rather than the tratsang itself.   

**Q:**  And these names are?   

**A:**  These are <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. སྒོ་མང] One of the large colleges in Drepung Monastery.">Gomang</a> and they have the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. བློ་གསལ་གླིང] One of the main colleges in Drepung Monastery.">Loseling</a>. And in Gomang they also have Düwa. And in Loseling there is Gyepa and Shagkor.   

**Q:**  Do you know how they're spelled?   

**A:**  Duwa [Tib. འདུལ་བ], Gyepa [Tib. རྒྱས་པ] and Shagkor [Tib. ཤག་སྐོར]. In addition to these three, then we have <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. སྒོ་མང] One of the large colleges in Drepung Monastery.">Gomang</a> [Tib. སྒོ་མང], <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. བློ་གསལ་གླིང] One of the main colleges in Drepung Monastery.">Loseling</a>, [Tib. བློ་གསལ་གླིང] Ngagpa [Tib. སྔགས་པ] and <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. སྡེ་ཡངས] One of the colleges in Drepung Monastery.">Deyang</a> [Tib. བདེ་ཡངས]. These are the four <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. གྲྭ་ཚང] A &quot;college&quot; within a monastery, for example, in Drepung Monastery there were four main tratsang: Gomang, Loseling, Deyang and Ngagpa. These tratsang were property owning corporate entities and included monks who were organized into residential dormitories called Khamtsen.">tratsang</a> normally functioning in Drepung as tratsang.   

**Q:**  And each one has an abbot?   

**A:**  So everyone of them are headed by an abbot and the number of monks differ. Now, for instance, <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. བློ་གསལ་གླིང] One of the main colleges in Drepung Monastery.">Loseling</a> late in the 50's probably had about, more than about 7,000 monks. Though Drepung said they had about 7,700 monks, that was the number of monks in Drepung, but Drepung's numbers later showed it was over 10,000 monks. And then of course the structure of the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. གྲྭ་ཚང] A &quot;college&quot; within a monastery, for example, in Drepung Monastery there were four main tratsang: Gomang, Loseling, Deyang and Ngagpa. These tratsang were property owning corporate entities and included monks who were organized into residential dormitories called Khamtsen.">tratsang</a> ... then of course above the tratsang there are <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཚོགས་ཆེན] The main assembly hall of a monastery. The assembly hall for the monastery as a whole.">tsogchen</a> [Tib. ཚོགས་ཆེན] . The general assembly tsogchen is there. And the tsogchen was headed by the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. མཁན་པོ་ཁྲི་པ] The most senior abbot in a committee of abbots such as the Laji.">khempo tripa</a> [Tib. མཁན་པོ་འཁྲི་པ] (abbot-chairman), the senior-most abbot of Drepung. He was called tripa, sort of chairman. So he was ... so he even was the senior-most. So it always was one of the ex-abbots of one of the tratsang.   

**Q:**  So it should be an ex-abbot?   

**A:**  Always an ex-abbot of the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. གྲྭ་ཚང] A &quot;college&quot; within a monastery, for example, in Drepung Monastery there were four main tratsang: Gomang, Loseling, Deyang and Ngagpa. These tratsang were property owning corporate entities and included monks who were organized into residential dormitories called Khamtsen.">tratsang</a>, khensur [Tib. མཁན་ཟུར]. So the senior-most ex-abbots would be the senior-most <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. མཁན་པོ] The abbot of a monastery or monastic college.">khempo</a> of Drepung. So the senior-most khempo of Drepung would be the Drepung Tripa [Tib. འབྲས་སྤུང་འཁྲི་པ]. Not necessarily, sometimes the khempo tripa can resign. When you resign, the next one will be the most senior, otherwise   

**Q:**  So the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཚོགས་ཆེན] The main assembly hall of a monastery. The assembly hall for the monastery as a whole.">tsogchen</a> consists of all the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. མཁན་པོ] The abbot of a monastery or monastic college.">khempo</a> and ex-abbots?   

**A:**  Tsogchen consists of all the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. མཁན་པོ] The abbot of a monastery or monastic college.">khempo</a> and ex-abbots, and all the monks.   

**Q:**  All the monks?   

**A:**  All the monks. So all the monks ...   

**Q:**  So that's the whole monastery?   

**A:**  The whole monastery. And they meet in the morning.   

**Q:**  So how is the administration managed?   

**A:**  Tsogchen administration, there are two parts. That would be ... actually I think there are three parts. The day to day activities of the monastery was decided by the laji, and/or sometimes it is Rigji [Tib. རིགས་སྤྱི] (governing committee). And the discipline part of it was managed and looked after by the shengo (discipline officer). The economic part of it was looked after by <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. སྤྱི་བསོ] The head managers/stewards of monasteries as a whole, especially the large Gelugpa monasteries like Sera and Drepung.">jiso</a> (economic officer).   

**Q:**  The <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. སྤྱི་བསོ] The head managers/stewards of monasteries as a whole, especially the large Gelugpa monasteries like Sera and Drepung.">jiso</a>?   

**A:**  Jiso.   

**Q:**  And how many laji are there? Four laji?   

**A:**  There are three different laji: senior, junior, and medium laji. But whenever they need only the senior laji and not junior and medium laji would not meet. The senior laji consisted of all the abbots and ex-abbots of the monastery, headed by the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. མཁན་པོ] The abbot of a monastery or monastic college.">khempo</a> tripa. And on top of that there was shengo, two shengo, and a <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཚོགས་ཆེན] The main assembly hall of a monastery. The assembly hall for the monastery as a whole.">tsogchen</a> umdze (assembly chant master), the chanting master.   

**Q:**  Who appointed the shengo?   

**A:**  The government.   

**Q:**  The government?   

**A:**  The <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ནོར་བུ་གླིང་ཁ] The summer palace of the Dalai Lama.">Norbulinga</a> appoint the shengo. And in the laji there are, in addition to the shengo, there is the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཚོགས་ཆེན] The main assembly hall of a monastery. The assembly hall for the monastery as a whole.">tsogchen</a> umdze. And on top of that, two jiso. In addition to that, phobrang depa [Tib. ཕོ་བྲང་སྡེ་པ].   

**Q:**  Who appointed the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. སྤྱི་བསོ] The head managers/stewards of monasteries as a whole, especially the large Gelugpa monasteries like Sera and Drepung.">jiso</a>?   

**A:**  Jiso was appointed by the government, but I think the government has to sort of stick to the candidates of what the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. གྲྭ་ཚང] A &quot;college&quot; within a monastery, for example, in Drepung Monastery there were four main tratsang: Gomang, Loseling, Deyang and Ngagpa. These tratsang were property owning corporate entities and included monks who were organized into residential dormitories called Khamtsen.">tratsang</a> says. So there are two <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. སྤྱི་བསོ] The head managers/stewards of monasteries as a whole, especially the large Gelugpa monasteries like Sera and Drepung.">jiso</a>, and the period of a jiso I think was six years, or, I don't remember. So the jiso are appointed by the government because they enjoy the rank of the tsidrung.   

**Q:**  And they are in charge of the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. གཞིས་ཀ] A manorial estate.">shiga</a>?   

**A:**  They are in charge. Most of the monastery <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. གཞིས་ཀ] A manorial estate.">shiga</a> are under <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. སྤྱི་བསོ] The head managers/stewards of monasteries as a whole, especially the large Gelugpa monasteries like Sera and Drepung.">jiso</a> control. But some shiga are under control of the laji, and some under rigji.   

**Q:**  What is a rigji?   

**A:**  Rigji consists of the six abbots. Six abbots of the monastery. Six present abbots. Ngagpa is not included. Ngagpa does not have rigji at all. So I do not know why, but Ngagpa is not included. And rigji means there is a festival in the monastery called rigtra.   

**Q:**  Can you spell that for me?   

**A:**  Rigtra [Tib. རིག་གྲྭ]. It comes during May of the Tibetan calendar. The Tibetan sixth month. So in rigtra, a lot of offerings have to be made, and these are made by one of the abbots. So each one of these abbots' tenure in the office is six years. Every six years they make the offerings of the rigtra, and then they become ex-abbots. Or if they get extra, one more tenure, they stay another six more years. So when all the six abbots join together, the organization is called rigji. They have some <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. གཞིས་ཀ] A manorial estate.">shiga</a> too. And they give a lot of lending money.   

**Q:**  Who?   

**A:**  The rigji has more business in lending money. And doing things like that, rigji has. And the laji I think they have less money. And the lajis' <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. གཞིས་ཀ] A manorial estate.">shiga</a> originally I think had more than the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. སྤྱི་བསོ] The head managers/stewards of monasteries as a whole, especially the large Gelugpa monasteries like Sera and Drepung.">jiso</a>'s. So it remained there.   

**Q:**  Jiso is spelled how?   

**A:**  Jiso [Tib. སྤྱི་སོ]. The <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. སྤྱི་བསོ] The head managers/stewards of monasteries as a whole, especially the large Gelugpa monasteries like Sera and Drepung.">jiso</a> are appointed, recommended by the two senior <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. གྲྭ་ཚང] A &quot;college&quot; within a monastery, for example, in Drepung Monastery there were four main tratsang: Gomang, Loseling, Deyang and Ngagpa. These tratsang were property owning corporate entities and included monks who were organized into residential dormitories called Khamtsen.">tratsang</a>; <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. བློ་གསལ་གླིང] One of the main colleges in Drepung Monastery.">Loseling</a> and <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. སྒོ་མང] One of the large colleges in Drepung Monastery.">Gomang</a>, so it then goes to the government and is approved there.   

**Q:**  So the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. སྤྱི་བསོ] The head managers/stewards of monasteries as a whole, especially the large Gelugpa monasteries like Sera and Drepung.">jiso</a> is controlled by <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. བློ་གསལ་གླིང] One of the main colleges in Drepung Monastery.">Loseling</a> and <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. སྒོ་མང] One of the large colleges in Drepung Monastery.">Gomang</a>?   

**A:**  Not controlled by <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. བློ་གསལ་གླིང] One of the main colleges in Drepung Monastery.">Loseling</a> and <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. སྒོ་མང] One of the large colleges in Drepung Monastery.">Gomang</a>, but individual <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཤག་ཚང] 1. The household or family of a monk that consisted of multiple monks. 2. The apartment of a monk household.">shagtsang</a> have control.   

**Q:**  Individual <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཤག་ཚང] 1. The household or family of a monk that consisted of multiple monks. 2. The apartment of a monk household.">shagtsang</a>?   

**A:**  In a <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཤག་ཚང] 1. The household or family of a monk that consisted of multiple monks. 2. The apartment of a monk household.">shagtsang</a>, one monk will become <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. སྤྱི་བསོ] The head managers/stewards of monasteries as a whole, especially the large Gelugpa monasteries like Sera and Drepung.">jiso</a>. And the one who becomes jiso will remain jiso for a very long time. So he becomes jiso and when his tenure is over, then his younger, and then junior and junior will become jiso. So for instance, as long as I was in Drepung, for almost nineteen years, at that time the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. བློ་གསལ་གླིང] One of the main colleges in Drepung Monastery.">Loseling</a> jiso was the Phara [Tib. ཕ་ར] jiso, and <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. སྒོ་མང] One of the large colleges in Drepung Monastery.">Gomang</a> jiso was the nicknamed, "tiger with torn up mouth, Takhare[Tib. སྟག་ཁ་རལ], and they never changed it. So I don't know before that.   

**Q:**  Did these <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. སྤྱི་བསོ] The head managers/stewards of monasteries as a whole, especially the large Gelugpa monasteries like Sera and Drepung.">jiso</a> have names?   

**A:**  They were called the east and the west [Tib. ཤར་ནུབ]. Phara Jiso is the individual <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཤག་ཚང] 1. The household or family of a monk that consisted of multiple monks. 2. The apartment of a monk household.">shagtsang</a>'s name. And the shagtsang's name is Jiso. And the house is also called Phara Jiso. So even today in India those people are called Phara Jiso.   

**Q:**  The next level of organization is the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. གྲྭ་ཚང] A &quot;college&quot; within a monastery, for example, in Drepung Monastery there were four main tratsang: Gomang, Loseling, Deyang and Ngagpa. These tratsang were property owning corporate entities and included monks who were organized into residential dormitories called Khamtsen.">tratsang</a> level?   

**A:**  Then the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. གྲྭ་ཚང] A &quot;college&quot; within a monastery, for example, in Drepung Monastery there were four main tratsang: Gomang, Loseling, Deyang and Ngagpa. These tratsang were property owning corporate entities and included monks who were organized into residential dormitories called Khamtsen.">tratsang</a> level. The tratsang level also has all the, as I mentioned, like a <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཚོགས་ཆེན] The main assembly hall of a monastery. The assembly hall for the monastery as a whole.">tsogchen</a>, and the discipline part is taken care of by the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. དགེ་སྐོས] The main disciplinary official in a monastic college (tratsang).">gegö</a>, (disciplinary officer), and the economic part is take care of by the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཕྱག་སྦུག] A manager (of estates and endowments) of a monastic college or monastic khamtsen.">chabu</a>(treasurer) as well as the bungdzö. Now there are again two different organizations here. chabu are appointed by the government, after the [????] [unclear] incident of 1921, then the chabu was appointed by the government, and for individual tratsang, they appointed bungdzö. Now most of the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. གཞིས་ཀ] A manorial estate.">shiga</a> were then in the hands of chabu, and a large amount of shiga are still in the hands of bungdzö.   

**Q:**  Bungdzö, can you spell that?   

**A:**  Bungdzö [Tib. སྦུག་མཛོད]. Even at <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. བློ་གསལ་གླིང] One of the main colleges in Drepung Monastery.">Loseling</a> there are twenty, twenty-three <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཁང་ཚན] A monastic residential unit in which monks from specific geographic areas lived. These were corporate entities with property and internal officials. Some large khamtsen had smaller subordinate units called mi tshan. Khamtsen were part of tratsang (colleges). For example, Hamdong Khamtsen was part of Gomang College in Drepung Monastery.">khamtsen</a> (residential dormitory). Out of those there are three big khamtsen , and then there are six   

**Q:**  The big one's are which?   

**A:**  Kongpo, Tsawa, [Tib. ཚ་བ] and Phukhang [Tib. ཕུ་ཁང]. So they have a <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཕྱག་སྦུག] A manager (of estates and endowments) of a monastic college or monastic khamtsen.">chabu</a> each. So then the middle one and the junior one I think they claim and then they go to <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. སྦུག་མཛོད] A manager/steward who was in charge of the estates of a monastery or monastic college.">bungdzö</a>. I think there are four bungdzö, and whether the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཁང་ཚན] A monastic residential unit in which monks from specific geographic areas lived. These were corporate entities with property and internal officials. Some large khamtsen had smaller subordinate units called mi tshan. Khamtsen were part of tratsang (colleges). For example, Hamdong Khamtsen was part of Gomang College in Drepung Monastery.">khamtsen</a> appoint by terms, I don't know. I think they do it by terms. So the bungdzö are there too. So the bungdzö meet separately, they function independently, without consulting chabu. chabu function independently, but they have the most money.   

**Q:**  But it just depends on which one has more money?   

**A:**  Chabu has much more money than the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. སྦུག་མཛོད] A manager/steward who was in charge of the estates of a monastery or monastic college.">bungdzö</a>, but bungdzö do very well, too.   

**Q:**  Do <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཕྱག་སྦུག] A manager (of estates and endowments) of a monastic college or monastic khamtsen.">chabu</a> and <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. སྦུག་མཛོད] A manager/steward who was in charge of the estates of a monastery or monastic college.">bungdzö</a> both have <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. གཞིས་ཀ] A manorial estate.">shiga</a>, or is it mostly   

**A:**  They have <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. གཞིས་ཀ] A manorial estate.">shiga</a>. <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཕྱག་སྦུག] A manager (of estates and endowments) of a monastic college or monastic khamtsen.">chabu</a> have shiga and loan, everything. And <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. སྦུག་མཛོད] A manager/steward who was in charge of the estates of a monastery or monastic college.">bungdzö</a> also have a little shiga. I think they don't have loans. And still chabu have much more money than a bungdzö does.   

**Q:**  Now each of the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཕྱག་སྦུག] A manager (of estates and endowments) of a monastic college or monastic khamtsen.">chabu</a> have responsibilities to give the assembly tea, <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. མང་ཇ] The morning tea served to monks from all the monastic colleges at the main prayer assembly hall.">mangja</a> [Tib. མང་ཇ] and <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. གཏོང་སྒོ] A monastic obligation to provide the food and other necessary items served at a monastic prayer assembly meeting or some other rite; this was often a required obligation for monastic officials at the end of their term of office.">tonggo</a> (expenses for ritual) and these kind of things?   

**A:**  No. A <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཕྱག་སྦུག] A manager (of estates and endowments) of a monastic college or monastic khamtsen.">chabu</a> is responsible for a certain amount of <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. མང་ཇ] The morning tea served to monks from all the monastic colleges at the main prayer assembly hall.">mangja</a> and <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. གཏོང་སྒོ] A monastic obligation to provide the food and other necessary items served at a monastic prayer assembly meeting or some other rite; this was often a required obligation for monastic officials at the end of their term of office.">tonggo</a> throughout the year, in combination, not individually. The chabu as an office. Not the individual monk, but all of them together. The chabu was headed by the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. མཁན་པོ] The abbot of a monastery or monastic college.">khempo</a> chandzö (abbot's treasurer).   

**Q:**  I didn't understand that. People mentioned that. That's appointed by the government?   

**A:**  No, <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. མཁན་པོ] The abbot of a monastery or monastic college.">khempo</a> appointed. The khempo himself appoints them. Khempo <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཕྱག་མཛོད] A senior manager/treasurer of an aristocratic or monastic estate, or the senior manager/treasurer of an aristocratic family or a monastic unit. Generally chandzö handled both internal and external issues and were considered higher in power and status than nyerpa (stewards), who typically only handled the storerooms.">chandzö</a> is appointed by the khempo and the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཕྱག་སྦུག] A manager (of estates and endowments) of a monastic college or monastic khamtsen.">chabu</a> is headed by the khempo chandzö.   

**Q:**  What does that mean? I mean, what does he do? Does he have any power or is that just in name?   

**A:**  No, no. He has power. It depends on the individual person, because he has equal rights to go there and poke his nose in. Because they will go around, he can say anything he wants to. And also they are headed by a <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. མཁན་པོ] The abbot of a monastery or monastic college.">khempo</a>. Chabu cannot make a lot of independent decisions without consulting the khempo. And sometimes the khempo does not get along well with the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཕྱག་སྦུག] A manager (of estates and endowments) of a monastic college or monastic khamtsen.">chabu</a> and khempo try to kick chabu out and there are a lot of incidents between them.   

**Q:**  The <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཕྱག་སྦུག] A manager (of estates and endowments) of a monastic college or monastic khamtsen.">chabu</a>'s power is from economics?   

**A:**  Chabu's power is mostly economic power. And the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. སྦུག་མཛོད] A manager/steward who was in charge of the estates of a monastery or monastic college.">bungdzö</a>'s is also economic power. Administrative power of the monastery, <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཕྱག་སྦུག] A manager (of estates and endowments) of a monastic college or monastic khamtsen.">chabu</a> doesn't have much, but everything has to deal with money, so they have to decide.   

**Q:**  And how are the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཁང་ཚན] A monastic residential unit in which monks from specific geographic areas lived. These were corporate entities with property and internal officials. Some large khamtsen had smaller subordinate units called mi tshan. Khamtsen were part of tratsang (colleges). For example, Hamdong Khamtsen was part of Gomang College in Drepung Monastery.">khamtsen</a> organized? These <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཕྱག་སྦུག] A manager (of estates and endowments) of a monastic college or monastic khamtsen.">chabu</a> are appointed by khamtsen , right?   

**A:**  Each <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཕྱག་སྦུག] A manager (of estates and endowments) of a monastic college or monastic khamtsen.">chabu</a> areâ ... the list is prepared by <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཁང་ཚན] A monastic residential unit in which monks from specific geographic areas lived. These were corporate entities with property and internal officials. Some large khamtsen had smaller subordinate units called mi tshan. Khamtsen were part of tratsang (colleges). For example, Hamdong Khamtsen was part of Gomang College in Drepung Monastery.">khamtsen</a>. Phuchag [Tib. ཕུ་ཕྱག] is prepared by Phukhang Khamtsen and Kongchag [Tib. ཀོང་ཕྱག] by Kongbo Khamtsen . And khamtsen s themselves will function again. khamtsen 's economic power is controlled by the tsondu. Tsondu is the senior monks, they get together. They decide.   

**Q:**  In the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཁང་ཚན] A monastic residential unit in which monks from specific geographic areas lived. These were corporate entities with property and internal officials. Some large khamtsen had smaller subordinate units called mi tshan. Khamtsen were part of tratsang (colleges).

**A:**  In the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཁང་ཚན] A monastic residential unit in which monks from specific geographic areas lived. These were corporate entities with property and internal officials. Some large khamtsen had smaller subordinate units called mi tshan. Khamtsen were part of tratsang (colleges). For example, Hamdong Khamtsen was part of Gomang College in Drepung Monastery.">khamtsen</a> . It is all controlled by tsondu.

**Q:**  Now how do people become officials? Do they usually become officials first in the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཁང་ཚན] A monastic residential unit in which monks from specific geographic areas lived. These were corporate entities with property and internal officials. Some large khamtsen had smaller subordinate units called mi tshan. Khamtsen were part of tratsang (colleges).

**A:**  Shagtsang is ... the rich monks ... they have their ... its like a lawyer's firm. They have their juniors. You know, the lawyer's, they have their juniors to go and do their junior job and like accountants, they also have their juniors. So the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཤག་ཚང] 1. The household or family of a monk that consisted of multiple monks. 2. The apartment of a monk household.">shagtsang</a>'s, they have their juniors, and the juniors and seniors share the same pocket.   

**Q:**  How do they organize themselves? How do they reproduce themselves over time?   

**A:**  Everybody knows that when the senior goes, become senior. Then the junior, the junior will become   

**Q:**  Well, where do they get the juniors from? How do they reproduce, meaning, like, in the households,[Tib. མི་ཚང], a woman marries and ...   

**A:**  No, that's true, but in the monastery its different. Sometimes they pick out the nephews and things like that who have to become a monk, sometimes they pick out some junior monk who they are not blood related to whatsoever. But in the monastery there is a system called <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. དགེ་ཕྲུག] 1. Student. 2. Disciple. 3. Commonly the name for monks living with a gegen or teacher.

In monasteries, however, it could also mean a real teacher, or the monk who served as the guarantor for a new monk.">gegen</a> or guide, or sort of a guarantee in the monastery. So the guarantor is responsible for this newcomer, for his discipline, for his food, for his clothes. So some of them, just incidentally, completely incidentally, that a rich <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཤག་ཚང] 1. The household or family of a monk that consisted of multiple monks. 2. The apartment of a monk household.">shagtsang</a> monk, one of the rich monks who belong to a rich shagtsang has to pick up one junior all of the sudden.

**Q:**  How come its always the rich people who get to keep them? You told me its only the rich people?
