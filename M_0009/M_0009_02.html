<p><strong>Q:</strong>  Let&apos;s talk a little bit about tsidrung (monk officials). I want to get this straight now. You can become a tsidrung through a shagtsang. Can you explain what shagtsang means to you and give some examples, things like that?   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  A shagtsang is such a ... it sort of becomes an institute. A set up sort of system, institutionalized in Tibetan monastic tradition. By having almost an adoption of a junior monk to their own sort of ... a concept of family, after all, how to say?   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  Its like a family then?   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  Yeah, in their social livelihood, whatever, the right sort of livelihood they share together. In other words, they adopt them. The senior people adopt some junior monk, many of them are their nephews, many of them are total strangers. Many of them related, many may not be related. Total strangers are adopted in their house. By adoption it means that the senior has taken total responsibility for their livelihood.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  They look after the young kids?   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  They look after the young ones, try to give them an education, and then they try to feed them and give them clothes.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  They call them gidru, usually?   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  Shagtsang gidru [Tib. shag tshang dge phrug]. Shagtsang gidru; the moment you add the gidru in addition you get a shagtsang gidru, it indicates they are sharing their pockets (financially). But a shag gi gidru [Tib. shag gi dge phrug], if it&apos;s a shag gi gidru, its not necessarily meaning a shagtsang gidru. First, many of them are kept as shag gi gidru.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  And what does that mean, shag gi gidru?   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  They, sort of, live in that house, and they are fed by them, but you have no rights over their property or anything. And when you prove that you are good, then they may make you shagtsang gidru without any official declaration, automatically.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  There is no letter or anything? No written contract?   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  No letter or anything. No written contract or anything. Sort of automatically picked out.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  Now these shagtsang have names, or do they not have names?   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  No, no. Or the senior monks, they take it.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  Its their names of senior monks?   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  Their names.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  Like what would be an example?   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  For example, Ugyen La [Tib. o rgyan la], we have interviewed Ugyen La. Ugyen La had a shagtsang called Thamak Shimpo [Tib. tha ma zhim po]. Thamag Shimpo is not a related to Ugyen La. That was his nickname, Thamak Shimpo was kept by Ugyen La. And so people nicknamed him, he had a good taste in tobacco. Thamak Shimpo this name is also called in Loseling too. Neither Ugyen La nor Thamag Shimpo became shengo.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  Now how did he find that boy? Do you have any idea?   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  Well, then in the monastery there were a lot of young boys. Sometimes you meet them and they just stay.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  But Ugyen La was not like a regular monk, or was he?   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  He is a regular monk.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  That&apos;s right, Ugyen La is in the monastery, he&apos;s not?   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  No, in the monastery. Regular monk, and so he meets.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  Now how about these families like?   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  Now, for instance, Ngawang Th&#xF6;ndup [Tib. ngag dbang don grub], he is the shagtsang of Yeshe Lh&#xFC;ndup [Tib. ye shes lhun grub].   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  Yeshe Lh&#xFC;ndup?   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  Yeshe Lh&#xFC;ndup. They lived just behind our house in Lhasa, you know. They used to run a school in Lhasa. Yeshe Lh&#xFC;ndup ran a school, my brothers went there to learn calligraphy.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  Now Yeshe Lh&#xFC;ndup is what, a tsidrung?   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  Yeshe Lh&#xFC;ndup is a tsidrung and he was a tsendr&#xF6;n in Lhasa. Yeshe Lh&#xFC;ndup had two tsidrung, shabd&#xF6;pa [Tib. zhabs sdod pa] and the other is Dragten La [Tib. grags bstan lags] in the shagtsang.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  Now, he&apos;s not a shabd&#xF6;pa, would you say? Because Yeshe Lh&#xFC;ndup is also an official. And then, when you said two people from a family are also </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  Dragten la is in Dharamsala and he worked for the Information Office, Dridrag [Tib. dril bsgrags] and he interviewed Phala and those people. Another one is Ngawang Th&#xF6;ndrup. But I do not know whether Ngawang Th&#xF6;ndrup is related to Yeshe Lh&#xFC;ndup. I don&apos;t think they are related. I don&apos;t think they are related at all. So he had become shagtsang, but </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  So this shagtsang, he may not have started it, Yeshe Lh&#xFC;ndup. He may have been the shagtsang&apos;s gidru from somebody else.   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  I don&apos;t know. He might have been, I don&apos;t know.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  But it continues? The property continues?   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  Continues, yes.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  So you would say that most of the tsidrung?   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  Many. Most of them, most of them. And then, when you have a capable tsidrung, then you get some, sort of stayed here and there. Like Jokteng drunyichemmo Jokteng Talama [Tib. lcog steng ta bla ma], he was an ordinary monk, totally ordinary. And he had been working with dr&#xF6;nyerchemmo Absog [Tib. ab sog].   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  He had been working for him, you mean?   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  For him. Like a semi-servant type of thing. Later, he became Rong Namse, [Tib. rong rnam sras] and he got a big estate called Rong Namse. So officially known as Namse, rather than Jogteng.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  So what happens when somebody says he wants to become his gidru, they start to give him an education so he can go in and become gidru?   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  Yes, that&apos;s it. That is exactly how it happens.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  So what happens, then, is that what? They hire a private teacher first?   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  No, no. They send him to the school, normal regular school.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  But this is a private school?   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  Private school. But like Yeshe Lh&#xFC;ndub, he&apos;s running his own school. So, like that. And it&apos;s a funny way to say, you know, a lot of senior monks pick up, many of them pick up some junior.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  A boyfriend?   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  Sort of boyfriend, semi-boyfriend. A lot of people think its homosexual, but its not really homosexual.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  Then what is it?   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  It&apos;s a different system. Totally different.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  How can it be totally different?   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  Its totally different.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  Why?   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  They don&apos;t use any of those things that normal people use.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  What do they use, then?   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  They only use </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  Sort of like in-between the legs?   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  In-between, yes.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  But that&apos;s the same thing?   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  You call it the same, okay, but that&apos;s different. Anyway, so they sort of invite them.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  What is that called? What&apos;s the term to make love to somebody like that?   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  Normally refer to it as boy-boy [Tib. spu gu spu gu], you know.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  No, but the doing of that </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  They don&apos;t really, you know, they don&apos;t have a big name for it. Sort of, you know, . In fact, many of the shagtsang are like that. Another thing is senior officials, you know, like big officials, I do not know what sort of Jogteng relation to dr&#xF6;nyerchemmo Absog. But definitely helped Jogteng to work in the Dalai Lama&apos;s private secretary during the 13th Dalai Lama&apos;s period.  There was also Tarala [Tib. rta ra lags] who is in Dharamsala working under Jogteng in Lhasa. Jogteng also has the shabd&#xF6;pa and there were three of them; Nyima La, [Tib. nyi ma lags] and Genla, [Tib. rgan lags] both in America and Kelsang La [Tib. skal bzang lags].   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  Now why would he have three?   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  They&apos;re his nephews, they&apos;re related, he picked his relatives. So he made it three because he&apos;s not rich. I don&apos;t think the tsidrung really needed any sort of estate. But then maybe he hoped he would get an estate later, I don&apos;t know. But I don&apos;t think they really needed an estate like  do.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  Then how do they live?   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  Well, the shagtsang are rich.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  Yeah, but what are they rich from? What do they use for income?   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  Like you talk about estates, he goes to Namse, that&apos;s very big, a big estate. And then he&apos;s powerful, very powerful. So, you know, a little bit of visitors. So they all generate income through many ways. And whenever anybody had any problems in any office, the officials concerned are bound to give a lot of financial benefits, on both sides.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  But that only helps the big officers?   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  They have several means.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  But that&apos;s the big ones. How about the small ones? How do they make a living?   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  The small ones I think they have a little problem. Because I do remember and even heard that ... not even heard, but even I have seen it, some junior shabd&#xF6;pa they find it very difficult to manage. Many of them.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  Like, give some examples of that.   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  Like take for example. There&apos;s one tsidrung called Thubten Rigchog [Tib. thub bstan rig mchog] who later became the father of Taktra reincarnation. He was from Shide [Tib. bzhi sde], Reting Rimpoche&apos;s monastery. And he did one official post called Jimi [Tib. spyi mi] in Shide [Tib. bzhi sde] [monastery]. And after that I don&apos;t know what happened. He used to live in one of the outdoor houses on the outside of our house. He was a moyen [Tib. mo yan] (tenant), he doesn&apos;t even have a house. He had a little apartment bordered on  house.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  Moyen is what?   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  Moyen is a tenant. It&apos;s not really a tenant in the western sense, because in the western sense the tenants will occupy the better and bigger and more important houses because they pay the rent. But in the Tibetan tradition, the moyen will not occupy the good and better houses. The better houses and everything will be kept for the families and they use it. They don&apos;t want anybody inside your own courtyard. So the outside courtyard, outside the walls, they rent it out to small families. Those are called moyen. And they have to pay minimum rent, very nominal rent, and they have a duty to clean the area out. And sometimes the family will ask them to help here, help there, so the moyen come and help.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  Now how did this guy get into become a tsidrung?   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  I do not know how he became a tsidrung. But he is a tsidrung. And he is poor. Not very poor, there are more that are poorer than him, though he is poor. He used to borrow clothes and horses and things from us all the time because he didn&apos;t really have enough. And he and his family, wife, they are living together.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  He had a wife even though he was a tsidrung?   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  Even though he was a tsidrung, he had a wife. But later he became the father, so he was demoted. He was thrown out because it became open.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  What about ... can you think of any cases when ... let&apos;s say there are like Khamba traders and they want to make their kid, like better, so </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  Well, there are Khamba traders like Sandutsang Rinchen [Tib. sa &apos;du tshang rin chen] and there was a Sumdo Gyentsen Y&#xF6;nten [Tib. sum mdo rgyal mtshan yon tan] and even Sandu Gyurmey la [Tib. &apos;gyur med lags] and all these, they have the rank.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  They were all tsidrung?   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  No, they are all lay official, drungkhor [Tib. drung &apos;khor].   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  No, I&apos;m talking about Khamba traders. I mean, like, you know, middle-class people who have some money but no status. So they want their kids to have status.   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  Then they can contact any one of those big tsidrung or something. Under the protection of the shagtsang they can get the tsidrung.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  They would then say ... they would probably have to give the shagtsang something, I don&apos;t know?   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  I don&apos;t think they do. It depends on their relations. Some close friends, they give ... I think they ... What really happens is the tsidrung in the shagtsang, or whoever, I think he has to guarantee the character and the obedience has to be guaranteed. And I believe tsidrung have more commitment than the drungkhor to the government. They have to guarantee, wherever they send them they will go, wherever they put them they will stay [Tib. btang &apos;gro bzhag sdod &apos;pher ba].   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  Can you spell that again?   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  [Tib. btang &apos;gro bzhag sdod &apos;pher ba]. I don&apos;t think the drungkhor have that. How do I know this? Because when Ph&#xFC;nkhang Jedrung La [Tib. phun khang rje drung lags] was demoted, one of the excuses, or the reason why, they used is he&apos;s a tsidrung. the tsidrung, they ask for, you know, they have the more things because they are not supposed to be a family. So they are supposed be isolated, and wherever they are sent they will go and stay. And the lay officials, drungkhor [Tib. drung &apos;khor] have a little excuse because they are from family and all this. The tsidrung don&apos;t have that.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  So the shagtsang has to guarantee this person?   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  Guarantee this person. I think that&apos;s why the shagtsang has to guarantee. As long as they have good officials who have guaranteed you, and I think anybody can become tsidrung if you know how to read and write.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  If you know how to read and write?   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  If you know how to read and write. But there are examples of tsidrung who don&apos;t know how to write and read.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  In modern times?   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  Yes.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  Who?   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  Khenjung Lobsang Gyentsen [Tib. blo bzang rgyal mtshan].   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  Really?   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  Yes. He can barely write. I was really shocked. Because, you know why, when I was first working in the Tibet House, that was in 65, we had a meeting and I was acting secretary, and Maya [Tib. rma bya] was there and three other tsidrung were there. So I thought Lobsang Gyentsen was the senior-most because he was the Khenjung, so I brought writing paper and a pen to him and said &quot;please take notes down&quot;. And he kept on saying, &quot;how can I do it&quot; [Tib. la dpe srid pas]. So I didn&apos;t know about it, and then Maya volunteered instead and took all the notes. So I was not aware of it. And later they told me that he does not write. It was true. But he had become khenjung. But his case is different. Because he was a servant of Jigyab Khempo, who went down to collect this Dalai Lama. And he had served very gratefully to His Holiness and brought him to Lhasa. And as a reward he was given the status of a shungshab. And then he had been promoted to become a khenjung, and then became the Shigatse Jidzong [Tib. gzhis ka rtse spyi rdzong] and then became the Head of the Trade Mission [Tib. tshong spyi] in India. Up to that much he went.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  Now these guys, they don&apos;t have to go in through the tse labdra?   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  Not necessary. I think tsidrung come in through three different ways: one through the shagtsang, one through the tse labdra, and the third one is when the officials are short, then they have the collection, trachag [Tib. grwa &apos;phyags] </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  Trachag&apos;s spelling is?   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  [Tib. grwa &apos;phyags] When they did the trachag, I think the trachag are normally put through the tselabdra, unless there is an exceptional thing.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  But that must be ... in your lifetime you don&apos;t remember any time that happened?   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  I do.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  You do?   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  Yes. When the Reform Office, Legj&#xF6; [Tib. legs bcos] was established in Lhasa ...   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  Legj&#xF6; was 1954, right?   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  1954. At that time there was a shortage of government staff and they did that, they collected. But when they collected them, they didn&apos;t put people into the tse labdra. They collected a senior official, tsidrung, a few of them, semi-government officials, semi-monastery representatives sort of combined with the  they give the tsidrung rank. That I do remember.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  But other than that, what happens in the old society?   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  Other than that, what happens is they collect trachag as young monks and put them in the tse labdra.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  No, but in your experience?   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  No.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  I think what happened is that in modern times tsidrung became totally separate from the monastery. In other words, not mainly monks from the monastery, but a separate group of people.   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  A separate group. But what happened is from the monastery point of view, they really feel that tsidrung are part and parcel of the monastery because they have to join either one of the monasteries before they become tsidrung.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  Yeah, but they don&apos;t have to stay in the monastery?   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  They don&apos;t have to stay, but they have to join in. So after that, whether they became a monk or not, it doesn&apos;t matter, they don&apos;t really bother to put their name or take up their name or anything. They don&apos;t even ... they totally ignore the monastery. But from the monastery point of view they still keep. They say &quot;he&apos;s ours&quot;. They even give share of alms [Tib. skal ba]. So, you know, not all the alms, but some important they give, even during the M&#xF6;nlam they the give them the tea to taste, tshabsi [Tib. tshwa gzigs], because they even set their teas and all this sort of thing. Yeah, they do it, monks they do it. But from the officials side they ignore. They sort of already moved.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  Even the poorer tsidrung?   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  It depends mostly on the individual. Some very high officials, like Jogteng sort of thing, they will really sort of bind themselves with the monastery very strongly, because they get the support. But then, you know, in-between people, they will ignore the monastery. They will sort of over-look them and laugh and, you know, sort of funny things they will do.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  So that&apos;s the tse labra, the second one is shagtsang, and the third one is </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  The trachag, the trachag was too.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  But the tse labdra was, just like </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  Tselabdra was also established at about the 13th Dalai Lama&apos;s period, I think, not before that.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  Oh really?   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  I think so. Because tsidrung are not really good at the language and writing. Writing and all this are not so good as drungkhor, so in order to improve that, I think he established the tse labdra. If I&apos;m not mistaken, I think he did.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  The tse labdra is just a school to teach people?   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  A school.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  Then you have to go to the mibab janshu [Tib. mi bab spyan zhu] [to show how you look]?   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  Then you have to go to the mibab janshu.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  But if you are shagtsang, you can go to the mibab janshu, or if you go through the tse labdra you can do?   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  I think mibab janshu both can be done. Both can be done, yes.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  I mean, basically everybody has go to mibab janshu?   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  Yes.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  But then, the avenues to get in, if you&apos;re in tse labdra, people in the government know you?   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  Yes.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  And how do you get to the tse labdra? Is that easy or is that hard? Ngawang Th&#xF6;ndrup was in tse labdra.   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  To get into tse labdra may not be so hard. But to get from tse labdra into to become the tsidrung is hard, because there are many very old tse labdra. They all want that, you know, you couldn&apos;t even get to tsidrung at all, and all most their lives to remain at tse labdra.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  So what do they do when they get old?   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  Well they just sit there and remain students at the tse labdra, you know.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  They must do some kind of work or something, no?   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  I don&apos;t think so. They just attend regular classes, keep on attending all the time. They have an exam, an exam that I think they keep on taking all the time. I don&apos;t think they have a limit, like if you take it three times you throw it out or something like that, you don&apos;t have that. And many of them remain a long, long time.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  So the </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  Even the tse labdra, to become a shabd&#xF6;gpa you have to have a lot of exercise too.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  But what&apos;s the origin of, like Lhalungpa [Tib. lha lung pa], what does he come from?   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  Yes, Lhalungpa, I think he is related to Drumpa Ch&#xF6;sur [Tib. bhrum pa chos zur].   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  Not the one from the 14th Dalai Lama, not that, the 13th Dalai Lama?   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  No, the 13th Dalai Lama died.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  That one?   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  No, Gowo Ch&#xF6;sur [Tib. go bo chos zur]  was the one who had trouble with the 13th Dalai Lama&apos;s death, and then I think thereafter is the Drumpa Ch&#xF6;sur. He has also become the ch&#xF6;sur. I don&apos;t know why, but Lhalungpa is related to the Drumpa Ch&#xF6;sur.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  Ch&#xF6;sur is?   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  Ch&#xF6;sur is the ex-oracle [Tib. ch&#xF6; rje zur pa]. So, Lhalungpa is, I think, from Drumpa Ch&#xF6;sur&apos;s shagtsang.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  I see. So, did they make money from their jobs? They get some money, some kind of rate or something? From the officers, they get something?   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  I think only later, I don&apos;t think they had much. I don&apos;t think they have much. Anything from the government, I don&apos;t think they get much. You know, originally, they get the drungja all the tsidrung they attend drungja. They are supposed to eat there, you know. They are supposed to be monks, and they don&apos;t have much to worry about, they have drungja, they will give the tea, and they give the tsampa there, so you eat there.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  But that&apos;s only once a day?   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  That&apos;s only once a day, but the monks are supposed to eat only once a day. According to the Vinaya rules. Not only once a day, but before that they are supposed to. They are not supposed to eat after that.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  During the 13th Dalai Lama&apos;s time it was when, in the morning or in the afternoon?   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  He changed it in the afternoon, rather late afternoon, after the office hours because of the K&#xFC;nphela. [Tib. kun &apos;phel lags] They have to wait until the K&#xFC;nphela, from Trapchi.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  So he made it in the afternoon?   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  He made it in the later afternoon. It became symbolic in any case by that time.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  And then later?   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  Later in the morning. What I remember it was always in the morning. Always in the morning.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  That makes sense because during the time of Lungshar [Tib. lung shar] it must have been in the afternoon because then they would go home. Because in the morning then they would go to the office, right?   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  In case it was in order of anything, then they would hold the drungja for a longer period.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  If there was any </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  Any special ceremonies, or some promotion, demotion, all these things announcing anything. Then they would hold it for a little bit longer than usual. Otherwise, they would come in and sit down and have some tea first, and would eat the pag, and then go. That&apos;s what the drungja is. So the tsidrung, they don&apos;t have to stay as long as the drungkhor do, because they are supposed to be monks, and the monks are not supposed to have so many things, so they are supposed to eat there, and back in the office. They don&apos;t have to go into town. The original idea I think goes back to .   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  Then it seems that there is another group of tsidrung who are from the monasteries, like Tengyeling [Tib. bstan rgyas gling] or Reting and those, who become shabd&#xF6;pa?   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  Reting, we don&apos;t count that.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  So those are not really shagtsang?   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  Not really shagtsang, but then they&apos;re sort of </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  I assume they would be helped by people in Shide [Tib. bzhi sde] or </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  Like, you mean those two examples, like, for instance, Thupten Tsering La [Tib. thub bstan tshe ring lags] and Panden La [Tib. dpal ldan lags], they are the Ling Labrang [Tib. gling bla brang] people.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  Ling Labrang is ... what do you mean?   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  This is the labrang of the tutor to the Dalai Lama, Yongdzin. So it was called Ling Labrang and Thubten Tsering is from Ling Labrang and Panden la is from Trijang [Tib. khri byang] Labrang.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  So, assuming in a case like that these people would learn how to read and write and then they would try do this mibab janshu.   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  Yeah.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  So they would go straight through?   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  They would go straight through. Yes, these people would go straight through.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  So, its like a shagtsang, in a sense?   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  Yes, almost a shagtsang.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  And their loyalty is probably always with the labrang?   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  More so. It is the labrang&apos;s responsibility. For instance, Panden La live there.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  They live in the labrang?   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  They live in the labrang. And then in the labrang also they have a very important position. Almost next to the chandz&#xF6;.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  And sometimes when you become a high post like a drunyichemmo, you get thapten [Tib. thab rten]. thapten means, like a salary estate or position?   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  Method.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  Method?   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  Method on which you can live on.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  So the example was?   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  The example is Lh&#xFC;ndup Dzong [Tib. lhun grub rdzong]. When we had the trouble with Lh&#xFC;ndup Dzong it was drunyichemmo&apos;s thapten.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  The drunyichemmo, which one?   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  Bumdang [Tib. &apos;bum thang].   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  Bumdang?   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  Yes, Bumdang. That was his thabten.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  O.K., that means </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  Maybe drunyichemmo, they don&apos;t leave it. I think they take them with them. I don&apos;t think they return them. Although they are supposed to, I don&apos;t think they return them.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  Because then there is also dep&#xF6;n had the estate called dashi [Tib. mda&apos; gzhis], right?   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  They don&apos;t return. And the kal&#xF6;n also had the same called kashi [Tib. bka&apos; gzhis].   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  They always bring them? Are you sure?   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  I remember Trim&#xF6;n [Tib. khri smon] had so much debt at the end, and one of the children&apos;s big estate which was the kal&#xF6;n&apos;s thabten. Later Trim&#xF6;n gave it to K&#xFC;ndeling [Tib. kun bde gling] to settle his debt.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  So it&apos;s not quite sure whether they actually give back these thapten, so like </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  On the other hand, whenever they became the dzong like that, and then later the it became the dzongshi shungzdin [Tib. rdzong gzhis gzhung &apos;dzin] </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  Dzongshi Shungdzin?   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  Yes, you know, later, the dzong and estates didn&apos;t belong to the individual and it was under the Legj&#xF6; and run by the government.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  Yeah, under the Legj&#xF6;.   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  Yes, not given to an individual, but all the income goes to the government.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  Not given to who?   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  To the individual. Whatever income they have goes to the government. They call it bumpa siblu [Tib. bum pa sib blug] . Whatever the income comes and goes into the government, whatever expenditures and also spent the same way, and the person who is responsible, they get part of it. So that was dzongshi shungdzin. And I think </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  So earlier they probably just kept it?   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  Kept it.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  O.k., let&apos;s go through some of the ... another way of coming into </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  Coming into the government official is through the Dalai Lama&apos;s kitchen, tse s&#xF6;lthab [Tib. rtse gsol thab] and they become Dalai Lama&apos;s cook, s&#xF6;thabpa [Tib. gsol thab pa], they enjoy certain rank. Some young people, they come there. Then, from the s&#xF6;lthabpa, they get promoted. Sometimes they promote someone else.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  How do you spell s&#xF6;thabpa?   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  [Tib. gsol thab pa]. So, normally, from the s&#xF6;lthab, they are promoted to the position of two p&#xF6;npo; p&#xF6;npo drepa [Tib. dpon po bgres pa] [the senior in charge of preparing the food for the Dalai Lama] and p&#xF6;npo sh&#xF6;npa [Tib. dpon po gzhon pa] [the junior in charge of preparing the food for the Dalai Lama]. Those normally should have been promoted. But in case of certain s&#xF6;lthabpa, they came out of the s&#xF6;ltabpa life and then goes into the official rank.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  Becomes a government official?   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  Government official. They, many of them become. And then another one is certain who have a lot of rewards, they have been powerful, something doing during the trouble period, becomes sort of powerful and then given a government rank. An example is Chamdo Khenjung Dawala [Tib. chab mdo mkhan chung zla ba lags]]. He was a Khamba, he was living always Chamdo. He has become ... he is  for the Tibetan.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  In 1980?   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  In 1980. Chamdo Khenjung Dawala. He was there even later on.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  In 1950 he was in Kham?   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  He was in Kham. That was Chamdo Khenjung Dawala. These are the examples.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  Now, is it your ... what my recollection is that in the government, all requests and that first go to the Kashag? So the Kashag sends it to Yigtsang, or to Laja Office?   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  Even the cases?   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  Cases or requests from its own dzong and estates, amd the miser want some exemptions, chagyang [Tib. chag yang] because there&apos;s bad rain this year ... is it that that these are first sent to the Kashag and then sent back?   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  I don&apos;t think so. They can send to Kashag, they can send to Tsikhang.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  You think so?   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  Yes, for sure. And then if it is something to do with the monastery then they will definitely send to Yigtshang. I mean, in dzong, in the dzong they had monastery troubles. Then that goes to the Yigtsang.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  No, I mean, Yigtsang, I know its that, but I&apos;m talking about in the government things. Requests about this or that, about information requests. I think it have to go to Kashag.   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  I doubt it. I really doubt it, because Tsikhang comes first. Some may even go to the Laja.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  I&apos;ll have to find out. Talking about now Drepung, that, so we&apos;re talking then about in Drepung which monks are in which khamtsen. Kongpo Khamtsen has monks from Konpo and has monks from nearby Lhasa, and has some of the people from some different regions, some people from Shotar Lhosum [Tib. sho star lho gsum] also, but not everybody.   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  Not everybody.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  I&apos;m not sure how it goes.   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  Well, nearby Lhasa also not everybody.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  And it has the status of a big khamtsen, but not necessarily that many people?   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  Not very many people, yes.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  Then what about Tsa Khamtsen [Tib. tsha ba]?   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  Tsha is mostly monks from J&#xFC; [Tib. &apos;ju] area in Kham.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  Kham J&#xFC;? I&apos;ve never even heard of J&#xFC;.   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  This is place from where Juchen Thubten [Tib. &apos;ju chen thub bstan] came.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  He is from Dege [Tib. sde dge], right?   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  Yes, it is J&#xFC; in Dege and Samdong Rimpoche [Tib. zam gdong rin po che] is also from there.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  So J&#xFC; is an area near Dege?   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  Near Dege some where. And there is a mountain called Tsha Karpo [Tib. tsha ba dkar po].   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  And J&#xFC; is spelled what?   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  [Tib. &apos;ju]   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  So mostly from there?   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  There, and also from Pagsh&#xF6; [Tib. dpa&apos; shod] I think.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  And Phukhang?   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  Phukhang and J&#xFC; is near and all the Kongtse Rawa [Tib. kong rtse ra ba] were also in Phukhang.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  I heard also that Ba Lithang [Tib. &apos;ba&apos; li thang] in there?   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  No.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  No?   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  Litang goes to Pompora [Tib. spom po ra] and Kongtserawa goes to Phukhang.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  O.K. Kongtserawa?   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  Yes.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  Ba Lithang goes to where?   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  Lithang goes to Pombora.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  And the Baba [Tib. &apos;ba&apos; pa]?   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  Baba goes to Phara [Tib. pha ra] and Gowo [Tib. go bo].   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  And Chamdo?   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  Chamdo goes to Lhopa [Tib. lho pa].   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  Like, what other is there like Khyungpo [Tib. khyung po]?   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  I am not sure.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  Let&apos;s see, what other regions are there in Markham [Tib. smar khams]?   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  Some of them goes to Phara and some of them goes to Phukhang also. Now, the teacher on the Dialectics School, Tsenyi Lobdra [Tib. mtshan nyid slob grwa] probably is from Markham [Tib. smar khams].   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  What about Gyethang [Tib. rgyal thang]?   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  Gyethang is Pombora.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  So where do the Mongolians, sogpo go?   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  They go to Gomang.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  And Amdos?   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  There are all different kinds of Amdo. Most of them are Gomang and few of them are Loseling.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  So Loseling then is what, mostly </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  And then there are also some other belonged to Tsha. There are two mitsen in Tsha; &#xDC;t&#xF6; [Tib. dbu stod] and Tsomai [Tib. mtsho smad or &apos;tsho smad?] both located in the T&#xF6;lung [Tib. stod lung]   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  O.K. then. Let me get this now. So Tsa has two mitsen?   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  Yes, the near by, nyekora and long distance, thagringa.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  How do you spell?   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  The near by, nyekora [Tib. nye &apos;khor ba] and long distance, thagringa [Tib. thag ring ba] They were Khambas.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  So when you say that Tsha Khamtsen has two mitsen, that means that of all of the monks, a lot of the monks are just in Tsha Khamtsen, but then there were also two mitsen?   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  Yes. But all the Tsha are not included in the mitsen.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  Just some of them are?   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  Just &#xDC;t&#xF6; and Tshomai.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  So what difference does it make if you&apos;re in a mitsen?   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  No difference.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  No difference?   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  Sometimes the mitsen has separate meetings, separate distributions that you can benefit from. But then these two mitsen; &#xDC;t&#xF6; and Tshomai, they are eligible to be shengo. And Tsha Khamtsen is not eligible to be shengo.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  Oh really?   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  Yes, only two of them are eligible to be shengo.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  So Deyang [Tib. sde yangs] and Ngagpa [Tib. sngags pa].   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  Deyang and Ngagpa are very small. But their monks are now mostly from nearby. So they don&apos;t really have anybody come from a distance.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  And Treu Khamba [Tib. tre hor khams pa], where are they from?   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  They are from Ganzi [Tib. dkar mdzes] and Drango [Tib. brag &apos;go] and Dargye [Tib. dar rgyas] are all goes to Treu Khamtsen.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  And Golog [Tib. mgu log]?   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  Some of them goes to Rongpo [Tib. rong po].   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  Rongbo is another one?   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  Yes.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  That&apos;s a small one?   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  Small one, but there were also Amdo in there and also Gulog. I heard that some Amdo comes to Loseling.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  O.K, now this is all automatic? If you come and you want to join Loseling, which khamtsen or mitsen they put you in, that&apos;s like automatic?   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  Automatic.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  You have no authority?   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  In my case a lot of trouble came up.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  Why?   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  Because I, being the son of Demo [Tib. de mo] Rimpoche, the Kongpo Khamtsen demanded that I go in their khamtsen. And my previous reincarnation was Nyare.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  Nyare is spelled what?   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  Nyare [Tib. nyag re]. So it was obvious that I should go to Nyare. So they had trouble, and I think then they chose to call me Nyare Khentr&#xFC; [Tib. nyag re mkhan sprul] by Nyare Khamtsen.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  I see. That was a new thing?   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  It was a new thing.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  So you were actually in Nyare?   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  In Nyare, and I don&apos;t want to shift.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  So you were physically where?   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  Nyare.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  In Nyare?   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  Yes.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  So would you say you joined Kongpo Khamtsen, what does that mean?   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  That means you can also list your name in Kongpo too.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  So you can do that, or was that special?   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  You can&apos;t do that.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  They just made a special case?   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  Special case. Although Demo Rimpoche came to join Drepung, and he joined Sera. And in then in Ganden. He joined all the three monasteries. Big Lamas are like that. Like Traya [Tib. brag g.yab] Rimpoche, he had to join in Drepung as a Nyare, he had to join Rat&#xF6; [Tib. ra stod] as a Nyare, he had to joined Ganden as a Nyare. And I think he doesn&apos;t join Sera. Mostly come from Traya. All the Traya monks go to Nyare.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  Nyare goes to Traya.   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  Traya goes to Nyare. And the Gonjo [Tib. go &apos;jo] too. Not much, I don&apos;t think there is much from Markham comes in Nyare.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  So what would the percent be, do you think, of the monks in Drepung, what would the percent be of Khambas versus &#xDC;tsangpa [Tib. dbus gtsang pa]? Say 80 percent?   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  In the case of Loseling, I really think it is about, if not 70, then 60 percent is Khambas.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  60 to 70 percent?   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  60 to 70 percent.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  And the rest would be &#xDC;tsangpa, or Amdos </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  Um, Amdos are not the rest. Mostly &#xDC;tsangpas, because Amdos are very small in Loseling, so they always, sort of become a part of, like, you know, sort of goes under Khamba division. Because the division is not made of Khamba and &#xDC;tsang, the division is made of Thagring and Nyekhor. So they go as distance, Thagring.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  O.K., now in Loseling </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  They are known as tragy&#xFC;n.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  Who is? Who is known?   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  Those coming known as tragy&#xFC;n and Nyekhor Tragy&#xFC;n. Tragy&#xFC;n is the continuation of the monk.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  And tragy&#xFC;n means?   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  Continuation of a monk.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  What does that mean?   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  To remain monks continuously.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  So Loseling has these 23 khamtsen, and then it has some mitsen?   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  Mitsen.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  Mitsen, as well.   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  There are not many mitsen.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  Now the structure of Loseling is that </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  Managed by the Loseling Khenpo.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  O.K.   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  In Loseling, the Loseling Khenpo is the highest. The abbot is highest. No matter how many you have Gyetr&#xFC; Huthogthu [Tib. rgyal sprul hu thog thu] , they all have to sit under Loseling Khenpo.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  O.k., even the Huthogthu.   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  Yes.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  O.K., he is appointed by the government for what, seven years or four years?   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  Six years.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  Six years. And the monks put up names? Now, how are the names picked?   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  Loseling Tratsang will select the outstanding, important people.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  Who? Who in Loseling?   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  The chabu and bungdz&#xF6; [Tib. sbug mdzod] they are the tratsang.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  And the ex-khempo?   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  Ex-khempo maybe has some say, yes.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  But these are only the people in Loseling?   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  Only in Loseling. And normally, in the traditional system. I think they are mixtures, but in between the 13th Dalai Lama even if the person has been abbot of any tantric college, their names are not put in.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  If the person has been what?   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  Abbot, abbot of a tantric college.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  Earlier in their life?   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  In their lifetime, they will not select their name to be able to be the abbot.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  Why is that?   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  I do not know. That is just the rule. And that is the tantric abbot, not the Loseling abbot.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  So you have the abbot then, and under the abbot is who?   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  The abbot is the head of Loseling, and then </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  And he is picked by the names are by the chandz&#xF6;?   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  The names are selected by the Loseling Tratsang, which means the tshondu, the assembly consisted of chabu, bungdz&#xF6;.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  The bungdz&#xF6; is the same as the chabu?   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  No, no. They are separate. In Loseling they are separate.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  O.K.   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  Chabu, bungdz&#xF6;, uch&#xF6;. That means, umdze, geg&#xF6; and the lama shunglenba [Tib. bla ma gzhung len pa].   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  Umdze, geg&#xF6;, and lama shunglenba. What does the shunglenba do?   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  The lama shunglenba is responsible for studies.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  Shunglenba is responsible?   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  Officially he is supposed to be responsible for studies.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  For studies. And the chabu does the what?   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  Chabu, there are four, comprising of the representatives of three big khamtsen.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  The Kongpo?   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  The Tsha, Kongbo, and Phukhang. And in addition to that, the abbot&apos;s manager. That&apos;s called labrang chanz&#xF6;. [Tib. bla brang phyag mdzod]   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  So what is the bungdz&#xF6;, then?   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  Bungdz&#xF6;, there are four bungdz&#xF6;. Sometimes there are six bungdz&#xF6; and they are selected by I think by the abbot from any other khamtsen besides those big ones.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  And what do they do?   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  They have ... they function parallel to the chabu.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  In what sense?   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  They have their meetings separately, they have separate shiga, they have their separate way of functioning everything. Because they live ... certain distribution, salary come from bungdz&#xF6;, certain salary come from chabu.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  So the bungdz&#xF6; and the chabu, basically, they are in charge of the estates?   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  They are in charge of estates and the loans.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  What, loans?   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  The estates, loans, every economic affair and the political affairs, they are totally in charge. And the chabu stay above the bungdz&#xF6;, and they show more power over bungdz&#xF6;. But they cannot overrule the bungdz&#xF6;&apos;s decisions.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  They cannot overrule it?   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  Chabu cannot overrule bungdz&#xF6;&apos;s decisions. I think what had happened was, during the Tengyeling [Tib. bstan rgyas gling] troubles, the 13th Dalai Lama made the point that all chabu have to be appointed by the government. So then Loseling started appointing bungdz&#xF6;. Then the government appointed chabu and Loseling had bungdz&#xF6;. This is how the bungdz&#xF6; had come later, not before. Since the government appointed chabu, then the tratsang started appointing them.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  Like, so what kind of decisions ... I just really don&apos;t have any idea what these people do? How the uch&#xF6; is spelled?   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  [Tib. dbu chos]. Uch&#xF6; will have not much to say in the case of Loseling. Umdze is responsible for saying the prayers and chanting, etc. and geg&#xF6; is responsible for discipline, and lama shunglenba is responsible for studies. O.k., that is their major responsibilities. They are invited into the meetings, but there is nothing they can really say because they are not really much involved in that. It depends on the individual. Once you&apos;re invited, if you are capable you can say, if you are not capable they have to observe somehow. But the major responsibility is economics and political, and even fighting, cases, everything is between the chabu and the bungdz&#xF6;.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  What about the khempo? I mean, he is at the meetings, isn&apos;t he?   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  Khempo is at the meeting, he has the final vote.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  He has the final vote?   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  He has the final vote.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  Meaning he can override them?   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  He cannot override, but if they are all divided, and the khempo can swing here and there.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  I see. So give some examples of ... either real examples of what they would talk about, or just make up some. Because I really don&apos;t have an idea of what happens.   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  Well, I mean, whenever a case comes </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  Well, give an example of something.   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  Say there is trouble in one of the Loseling shiga, o.k., say if a household, there is trouble, so when there is trouble in the household, of course first what they try to do is they try to deal with it by the Estate Manager, deba [Tib. sde pa], the deba of the shiga itself, when he cannot handle it within reason, naturally he will refer to either bungdz&#xF6; or chabu. In the case of nyerba [Tib. gnyer pa] I think it is under the chabu, so they refer to the chabu. The chabu will try to solve their needs and they discuss there and they send their representatives, persons like Urgyen La and then there is a person named Mirab D&#xFC;npa [Tib. mi rab bdun pa]. There are two of them, both famous in Loseling. Urgyen La two of them. They go to Lhasa. Chabu do not go personally, they will send a representative to talk to the kudrak of dewashung, or wherever gag or Yigtsang. Even sometimes in the tsikhang. It depends on the case, like sometimes in the Kashag. So they go on behalf. And then they discuss with the chabu and they do it. And when the chabu have even more difficulty, and then the chabu themselves personally go down. Go down to meet with kudrak, consult with them in their houses, and before they go into their meeting. So then they go into the meeting. And when they can&apos;t handle it, then they come back and call the bungdz&#xF6;, and also call, talk to khempo first and see if anything can be done. If not, then bungdz&#xF6; will be informed and uch&#xF6; will be informed, and then the representatives of the 23 khamtsen will be informed.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  I see. And then what happens?   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  And then they have the meeting. They discuss whatever. And the big decisions are made there: whether you are going to revolt or whether you are going to go against the government&apos;s ruling or whatever you are going to do. They decide it in that setting. And the representatives of the khamtsen are normally the jigen system. Khamtsen will have again officials. The senior-most official is jigen.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  How do you spell that?   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  [Tib. spyi rgan]. The jigen is the ... normally senior.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  Now a khamtsen has what, one, two?   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  Oh, more than that. Under jigen, then you have khamtsen gegen. And the khamtsen gegen generally looks more powerful than jigen because he is responsible for the discipline. And the jigen has a more official position during the prayer meetings in the khamtsen. He is one of the senior monks. But when the decision making things come, then the jigen has a lot of things. The jigen is responsible to call the meeting of khamtsen tsondu, O.k., under the khamtsen gegen then you have the nyerpa. In the case of Nyare Khamtsen, we have two nyerba.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  How many nyerba are there in Nyare Khamtsen?   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  Two nyerba.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  So, in Nyare Khamtsen, how many jigen do you have?   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  One.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  One jigen, say, in Nyare, in Nyare Khamtsen?   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  One jigen.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  For example, has one jigen, one khamtsen gegen, two nyerba.   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  O.K.? Two nyerba.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  Nyerba&apos;s function is what?   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  Nyerba&apos;s function is to manage the daily tshomja and all this.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  Daily prayer tea?   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  Daily tea, and food distribution of all, whatever they have to do in the kitchen, they are responsible for it. And also he is responsible if anybody died. Any monk who dies has no ... what do you call it ... no, nobody to, sort of ... nobody inheritance ...   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  No heirs?   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  No heirs. And the nyerba, in addition to the gegen of the individual monk is responsible for disposing of his belongings and ... belongings, yeah, that&apos;s it.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  His own gegen?   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  His own gegen.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  I see.   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  Now ... there is a very interesting case now. Below nyerba, junior ... every year four monks will go, in the case of Nyare Khamtsen, every year four monks will be transferred from the sh&#xF6;ndre.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  Sh&#xF6;ndre is what?   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  Sh&#xF6;ndre is the junior monks who are not exempt from the monastery tax. So they are not exempted. Every year four monks will be, seniority-wise, exempted from the work obligation as a junior monk. Out of four, by lottery, two will become nyerba, and two will be exempted.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  I see. They are just exempted.   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  Yes, four names they will roll it.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  So.   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  Now these four - whoever is going to be exempted for - the nyerba have a lot of expenditures also. Personally they have a lot of expenditures. So in order to meet that, in the case of Nyare Khamtsen we have the chapel called Dr&#xF6;lma Lhakhang [Tib. sgrol ma lha khang] in Jokhang in Lhasa. So every income of Dr&#xF6;lma Lhakhang comes to Nyare Khamtsen. So Nyare Khamtsen doesn&apos;t collect in the khamtsen, they make these four monks ... they allow these four monks to collect.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  So like </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  They allow these four monks to go.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  To use that income?   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  To use that income.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  From Dr&#xF6;lma Lhakhang?   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  Yes, from Dr&#xF6;lma Lhakhang. They go there and sit four months for each.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  Three months?   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  Yeah, three months each. So three months each, and during the three months whatever income you got is your personal income. Whichever, anybody who offers anything to Dr&#xF6;lma, you know, the Lhasa seniors they give money, they throw money and offerings, all this will go to the monks there. It&apos;s yours to keep.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  I see. And that&apos;s just the way it is?   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  That&apos;s ... every year they go and change. Every three months they go and change.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  And these are under the nyerba?   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  These ... these four monks who are keeping the Dr&#xF6;lma Lhakhang this year will be rolled their names. And two will become nyerba and two will be free.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  But they still go and get their money?   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  They still go and get their income. That&apos;s good luck for them.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  So who appoints the nyerba?   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  They roll their names, four names.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  No, but this is after the fact. The nyerba himself? There are two nyerba, right?   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  Yes.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  So how does the nyerba get picked?   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  You see, that&apos;s what I mean. Every year four monks exempted from the junior work obligations.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  Oh, I see.   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  When they are examining that year, they get the Dr&#xF6;lma Lhakhang, they roll their names, and two become nyerba. Now between the nyerba and the khamtsen gegen, every year there is one monk who becomes a khamtsen gegen, in between that period there is a sh&#xF6;ndre gemba [Tib. rgan pa] which is the senior sh&#xF6;ndre or junior tsondu. The khamtsen gegen and above are the members of the tshondu. Now it becomes the decision-making.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  I see. Khamtsen gegen?   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  And above.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  So the khamtsen gegen and the only ones above khamtsen gegen?   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  Are the tshondu members.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  Are the jigen?   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  Yes, the tsondu members.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  No, I&apos;m saying, but ... the only one in the khamtsen who is higher than the khamtsen gegen is the jigen?   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  Is the jigen and the incarnate lama, but that&apos;s a different case.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  I see. Do they go too? The incarnate lama?   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  They do go through him, yes.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  The tsondu?   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  No, they don&apos;t go through him at all. No, no, tsondu, they don&apos;t go through him. They will call the tsondu in. So all the tsondu members will come in your room and talk to you. It also depends. If it&apos;s a big lama or small lama or a gegen. The bigger lamas, all the tsondu will come to you, the junior lamas, tsondu will send a representative, I think two, three, four, seven, like that.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  Now that&apos;s the tsondu of the khamtsen?   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  Tsondu of the khamtsen.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  So the tsondu of the khamtsen is very small, its just two people, in Nyare Khamtsen?   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  No, no, there are a lot of people.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  Like Nyare Khamtsen? There&apos;s two, right?   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  No. Khamtsen gegen, every year there is one khamtsen gegen. When you become ex-khamtsen gegen you become a member of the tsondu.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  Oh. See, you didn&apos;t say that. I see. The tshondu was all the ex-ones?   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  Ex-khamtsen gegen are all and three monks will become without becoming the khamtsen gegen. Every year four would come in, right? And two become nyerba, and two are exempted. Although sometimes these four will go into ... every year four will be moved up. So every year move up. So when you move up from the senior sh&#xF6;ndre into the tsondu, you become khamtsen gegen. Out of four, there is only one khamtsen gegen.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  And the other three?   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  Three just move in.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  Move in where?   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  In the tsondu. During when he is khamtsen gegen ... I have three other colleagues, and I become khamtsen gegen, out of them, I become khamtsen gegen. And during that period my three colleagues will be the senior-most junior sh&#xF6;ndre, and when I join the tsondu, all three will join the tsondu. When I&apos;m finished with my khamtsen gegen, then all four of us will be going to join the tsondu.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  After you&apos;ve finished your khamtsen gegen?   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  Yes. One year they will be just waiting. They go to khamtsen gegen but they don&apos;t have power, no power. No official position.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  So during that year they will not sit with the tsondu?   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  They do not sit with the tsondu, but they are the senior-most of the sh&#xF6;ndre.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  Of the senior, sh&#xF6;ndre gemba?   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  Yes, the sh&#xF6;ndre gemba.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  And then after sh&#xF6;ndre gemba you become?   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  The tsondu.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  Tsondu.   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  Then you remain in the tsondu until you become the senior-most of the seven. There is seven beginning from the first down to the seventh, who is the senior-most.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  In terms of seniority?   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  Seniority. And out of one of the seven, one is the jigen. If one of the seven is not healthy enough, then they will appoint somebody.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  Who appoints the jigen?   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  I think the tsondu does. They don&apos;t really ... sort of they ask you, &quot;what are you doing?&quot;, sort of ... you know, with us that way. There&apos;s no official.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  They don&apos;t do it like </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  No, no. No condition [Tib. mthun rkyen], no term, nothing. The khamtsen gegen, they do that.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  Oh, do they?   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  Again. Yes, again.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  Khamtsen gegen is done by senriy?   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  All the four will go again together.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  All these four. Those four are picked by senriy?   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  By senriy. Because the senior four will go back down, two of them rolled to be nyerba, and four of them would be rolled and one comes out as khamtsen gegen.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  So that there is that fact that there are two monks?   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  Khamtsen gegen is just one. The discipline is always khamtsen gegen, nobody else.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  And he is just one year?   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  He&apos;s just one. The discipline is totally khamtsen gegen. Even the tratsang or tsogchen shengo, anything to do with the khamtsen, they will contact khamtsen gegen. And the khamtsen gegen will contact the tsondu, and tsondu will go. And when they become big cases, now, for example, then the lamey [Tib. bla med]came. Then the traya [Tib. brag g.yab] lamey came. The traya lamey has all these different .   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  The traya lamey is a person, or what?   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  A person, that&apos;s his name. And he died, and then his brother died, and he had a nephew that had come, and then they became . And then there was a lot of division in the khamtsen, all of this division I remember. So when these cases, big cases come, then the tsondu will discuss, and the tsondu will call the seniors between the nyerba and khamtsen gegen, whatever the amount of monks there were. They were called in the tsongdu.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  And what do they do?   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  They end it among discussion. The tsondu body becomes enlargened. Then the sh&#xF6;ndre will meet separately now. So the sh&#xF6;ndre gemba ... the sh&#xF6;ndre will meet down somewhere separately, and the sh&#xF6;ndre gemba still can go into the tsondu as well as down there. They are sort of double-sided, half here, half there.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  What about the ones who are not sh&#xF6;ndre, the ... what do you call them ... the ones who are not sh&#xF6;ndre, what about them?   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  They don&apos;t go into tsondu also. They are not really important. One is a senior and one is a junior. They cannot be individually .   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  So if there are two-thousand monks in a khamtsen, lets say, so then all the monks who are sh&#xF6;ndre, and some time they need to move up.   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  They need.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  And then, when do you become sh&#xF6;ndre gemba, I mean, after a couple of years, or how does it work?   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  Several years. Every year four monks go on, so then you have to wait your turn.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  I see.   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  So, in the case of Nyare Khamtsen, you have these big monks, probably Nyare was one of the biggest number of monks in Loseling. Nyare was the biggest of them.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  Really?   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  Yes. Number one. Trehor also had a lot. So they will have, Nyare I think they take about thirteen to fifteen years to become a sh&#xF6;ndre gemba. And then tsondu.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  Every year four people become sh&#xF6;ndre gemba, and from the sh&#xF6;ndre gemba every year four people become nyerba and four people go to tsondu?   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  That&apos;s right. In-between the tsondu and the nyerba ... coming out of the sh&#xF6;ndre is the nyerba, and giving into the tsondu is the khamtsen.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  I see. So all the ... in Loseling it&apos;s the same as Gomang too?   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  I think so, almost the same as in Loseling.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  So all of the khamtsen are structured this way?   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  All the khamtsen are.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  And then ... that&apos;s the khamtsen structure. So are there any other officials in the khamtsen?   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  Umm ... there are not other officials, I don&apos;t know. Among a khamtsen, some will become tratsang officials.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  No, no, lets leave that. Of the khamtsen ... lets say, during the Tengyeling [Tib. bstan ryas gling] trouble, I&apos;m sure all the khamtsen met to discuss should they fight or not fight, what they should do, right? So on one level, the lowest level, is the mitsen or khamtsen as to what to do.   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  Yes. sh&#xF6;ndre of the khamtsen will meet, they make their decision, they let tsondu know, they discuss together. Then the sh&#xF6;ndre gemba will go up to the tsondu, express the views of the sh&#xF6;ndre, and the sh&#xF6;ndre gemba will come down to the sh&#xF6;ndre, express the views of the tsondu. They meet like that. I don&apos;t know why. Because it takes a lot of ... its long. They go up and down, do these things. And then the khamtsen will express their views into the tratsang tsondu. It depends, sometimes they go one representative, sometimes they go two representatives, sometimes they go even seven or eight or twenty representatives.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  The khamtsen?   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  Sometimes the tratsang will call the tsondu of all the khamtsens to meet in the tratsang.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  So then, as you said, in the tsondu then there are the bungdz&#xF6;, and in the tratsang the chabu, uch&#xF6;, khempo, plus the ex-</p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  And then in the tratsang there is a nyertsang. Two nyertsang in Loseling.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  This is in Loseling?   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  In Loseling, there is one called jama [Tib. ja ma] and there was also Lama K&#xF6;nyer [Tib. bla ma dkon gnyer].   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  He does what?   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  He is responsible for looking after the tratsang&apos;s images and things inside the chapel. But their official position also had some income. And there was the tratsang chabril and the uch&#xF6; under the geg&#xF6; .   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  Under the geg&#xF6; is what?   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  It is chabril.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  What do they do?   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  Chabril is responsible for the discipline. In the tratsang gathering, when there are tea etc served, chabril will come. But, when there are not tea served, instead of chabril, the ch&#xF6;sungwa [Tib. chos srung ba] will come. He has not much power, but he can beat people.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  Now if the khamtsen has its own shiga, does the khamtsen have its own shiga?   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  Yes, there were many khamtsen having shiga.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  Then who is in charge of those?   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  In some khamtsen, the tsondu will do the depa [Tib. sde pa]. In Nyare Khamtsen&apos;s case there is a lot of business involved.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  What do you mean business?   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  There is a lot of business.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  Like what?   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  Nyare Khamtsen has a lot of money. And they give money to the business people in Lhasa.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  Loans, like?   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  Not loans. They give investments, matsa [Tib. ma rtsa] to the businessmen, and then they accept </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  Some profit?   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  Profit. More than the interest.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  I see. Then who is in charge of tsondu? But there must be somebody who looks after it. It can&apos;t be </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  No, not a , no. Everything is decided by tsondu. tsondu may accept from some important people some ... you know ... that is totally unofficially. All of the most efficient men will be the sort of hired, and he adds, and he goes down to do calculations. You know, he decides .   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  I see. So really </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  Or jigen. jigen can contribute their independent .   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  So really its like exactly the same. What goes on in the khamtsen level, you have mangja, you have the tsog, prayers, they save money, then its exactly the same at the tratsang level, its just that there are different estates. Some estates belong to tratsang, some estates belong to khamtsen.   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  Yes, some of them belonged to the tsogchen.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  That means the monastery, gompa [Tib. dgon pa]   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  Yes, tsogchen.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  Tsogchen means the gompa?   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  Yes, below the gompa, then there are a lot of divisions. Some belong to jiso, some belong to laji.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  Ok, let&apos;s then hold up a second. [What about the] tratsang?   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  Tratsang ... the highest of the positions, the top, is the khempo, the abbot of the tratsang is the top. And he is assisted by the four chabu.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  Who assisted him, they would be under him?   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  Under him. Four chabu, four bungdz&#xF6;, and three uch&#xF6;.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  Four chabu, that&apos;s right. That&apos;s where we started off.   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  I think. It should be.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  I&apos;m assuming they are under him. We didn&apos;t go into it entirely. Then there is the three uch&#xF6;?   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  Officially I think the uch&#xF6; are above the chabu and bungdz&#xF6;. Consisting of the umdze, gegen, and lama shunglenba [Tib. bla ma gzhung len pa]. And they each have responsibilities. Of the chabu, they are generally responsible for the tratsang&apos;s economic affairs. Both chabu. Chabu and bungdz&#xF6;. Then there are the nyertsang.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  Bungdz&#xF6; is spelled how?   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  [Tib. sbug mdzod].   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  And this is a new post?   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  A new post. I think it was created only after when the Dalai Lama started appointing the bungdz&#xF6;.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  Right, right. 1920-1921.   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  After that then the Tibetan government started appointing chabu so that the governments interests would be safe. So then tratsang started appointing bungdz&#xF6; I think.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  But they had to give them space, to look after them.   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  Yes, the bungdz&#xF6; have a lot of space.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  So the monastery had to give them </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  The monastery didn&apos;t give out of chabu. Whatever they could give was new thereafter. I think they did it instead of giving to the chabu. And the top level remained Phara Khempo period.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  Where does he come from?   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  He came from dewashung, I don&apos;t know where he comes from.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  So who is in charge of discipline in ...   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  Geg&#xF6;.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  So the geg&#xF6; ... that&apos;s in tratsang?   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  That&apos;s in tratsang.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  And who appoints those?   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  Khempo.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  Geg&#xF6; is spelled?   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  [Tib. dge bskos]   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  How many of those are there?   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  Only one or one year.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  Appointed by khempo for one year.   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  You know, what happened ... let me tell you what happened. The khempo started appointing the geg&#xF6; for six years. So it was six years. So what happened is as soon as the khempo appointed a geg&#xF6;, they would come and the new khempo would start appointing, and other than for about two or three years they all would have been appointed by the khempo before.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  And then ... then there are you said, and lama k&#xF6;nyer.   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  Lama K&#xF6;nyer, jama, chabril. There is only one chabril and two jama.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  Then ... yeah ... and you said the bungdz&#xF6; are not from the four big khamtsen?   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  No. Four big khamtsen. Three big khamtsen ...   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  Three big khamtsen?   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  Three big khamtsen, they are kind of a lifetime appointment. Unless they are demoted, otherwise they remain for a lifetime.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  And this labrang chandz&#xF6; does </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  The labrang chandz&#xF6; will change every khempo time.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  What&apos;s the distribution of authority? What does the khempo do?   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  Khempo has over all in charge. Over all in charge on  , examinations, demotions, promotions, and seeing that ... keeping everything at optimum. You know, the monks, from junior to senior, there are a lot of things. Like tshoglang [Tib. tshogs lang]. Tshoglang means eliminated sort of examinations. There are different tshoglang every on every subject. So, like, for instance, pharchin [Tib. phar phyin] takes 3 years, d&#xFC;wa [Tib. &apos;dul ba] takes 4 years and uma [Tib. dbu ma] takes 2 years. Pharchin has 6 divisions and uma has 3 divisions and d&#xFC;wa has one.  These are the tshoglang. The final examination is given by the . And then there is the tratsang umdze and lama shunglenpa. All of those were appointed by the abbot.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  Bungdz&#xF6; are appointed for how long?   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  I think six years. Yes, that&apos;s it. One khempo appointed one bungdz&#xF6;. So that would be six years. I think bungdz&#xF6; are  by different khamtsen.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  So then, when there are big issues, then they have </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  When the bigger issues come, the chabu will contact individually the khempo, and bungdz&#xF6; will contact individually the khempo. They both start to contact him. And then chabu will consult each other when the bigger issues come, or when chabu will discuss the matter with the khempo and the khempo cannot decide alone, the chabu ... khempo will come , and then they become . bungdz&#xF6; will discuss the matter with the khempo, khempo cannot decide alone. Then, even then if they cannot decide, then go to tratsang tsondu. That is aided by the uch&#xF6;. When that is not decided, then they are aided by the representatives of the khamtsen. In addition to that, the representatives of the khamtsens, were specially invited. Specially invited like an expert. Like Urgyen La and. They will become like the people under the khempo. And then, in addition to the very openly invited .   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  So that&apos;s how the tratsang functions?   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  That&apos;s how the tratsang functions.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  So, basically then, the people from the big khamtsen ... like your loyalty as a monk is primarily to your khamtsen first?   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  Yes.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  And they are the people you work with, right?   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  Yes.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  And you interact with them?   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  Yes. And you defend your khamtsen in any tratsang.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  So the big khamtsen therefore have the most influence?   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  Khamtsen have more influence. And then there are 23 khamtsen in Loseling, there are 23 different influences there .   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  So if you think of it in terms of power, since Gomang and Loseling are mostly like</p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  Equal.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  People from far away, the wages, subsistence, are in the hands of the of the thagringa And they are the real power-houses, they have the money.   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  But when government matters come up, then the representatives choose one chabu, and chabu will go. And whatever happened, I don&apos;t think the monks bothered. Unless it was objecting to his own tratsang or khamtsen. Until then, they don&apos;t even bother with what happened. When issues like the Reting case, it is a different matter. When it&apos;s Tengyeling case. When it is affecting to you, then they will go all-out. Exercise their influence, power, and monks living there ... And the khempo has to act almost like a defender. Otherwise the khempo will get in trouble. Like in Sera Je. And if the khempo refuses to act according to the tratsang he could be killed.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  Now what about the tr&#xFC;paiku [Tib. sprul pa&apos;i sku] [the reincarnated lamas]? Like the tr&#xFC;paiku in khamtsen. Are there trulpaiku in khamtsen?   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  Tr&#xFC;paiku are everybody lives in khamtsen.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  Khamtsen, tratsang ... so, like, do tr&#xFC;paiku&apos;s representatives ... do they try to go to tsondu or anything?   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  No. None. They can&apos;t. The tr&#xFC;paiku&apos;s interests are in ... very strongly protected by khamtsen and tratsang and the tsogchen. Tsogchen not much, but the tratsang very strongly protected. And tr&#xFC;paiku will also see to it that they get strong support from khamtsen and tratsang, and khamtsen and tratsang will see to it ... according to the level of the tr&#xFC;paiku, he really will be protected very strongly. I forgot to mention one thing about khamtsen. I mentioned to you that khamtsen has business. Not only does khamtsen have business, there is something more than that. They also protect your almost sponsor, Jindag [Tib. sbyin bdag] dependent lay people who belong to your, sort of, side, or an ex-monk who tries to do business, or a big family who is part of the khamtsen ... part of the khamtsen in the sense of wherever the tragy&#xFC;n comes from, and wherever that area is the khamtsen will look to them as their own.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  That&apos;s why they give them tonggo?   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  Yes, they will. Originally, that&apos;s why. Like that.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  They have their own ?   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  They have their own sort of interests. So Tengyeling, and Demo, and Reting, goes beyond the khamtsen&apos;s interests. They become ... never get involved. If it becomes too big and all that, khamtsen has no way to cover. And interested in keeping peace at home. For example, Nyare Khamtsen. The tsondu would see to it anybody that ... of ex-monk, or any of the khamtsen&apos;s Jindag, if they are not doing, khamtsen will help.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  Not doing what?   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  When they are not doing, the khamtsen will see to it.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  Well, what do you mean by they are not doing?   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  If that his business is falling down, not doing good, not doing well. Khamtsen will come out with an interest-free loan and the khamtsen will ask the business man of the khamtsen to help with a small loan. And they do this. They protect that very strongly. They watch over it in a very strong way. And then with agreement, they will see that they recovered their loan and all this. And that was what they do. And according to the monks these business people will also remain indebted to you. They make a lot of offerings and distribution. That&apos;s how the relation is built in-between.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  If a monk have a trouble of the monastery, then he becomes the monastery&apos;s miser or what?   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  No, no. He remains as a monk.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  I mean if they were expelled.   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  I don&apos;t think they become miser anybody. Maybe some of them goes to Soman Lekhung [Tib. so nam las khungs] [Agriculture Office], I really don&apos;t know. But most of these monks who lost their celibacy are more or less belonged to Khamba Traders [Tib. tshong pa] and they become like Khamba Tshongpa. And they even send them ... you know, if there is a minor child </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  There&apos;s a what?   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  If there is a minor child and the old people died and there&apos;s some children. And then the khamtsen sends somebody there to sit in the family. To look after the child, to bring them up, until the man is old enough to look after himself.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  They do that to the jindag?   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  Yes. Nyare Khamtsen did that very much.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  So that makes close relations?   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  That makes a lot of close relations.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  Now, that&apos;s within Loseling Tratsang. Now what about Gomang?   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  Gomang doesn&apos;t seem like that.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  The big ones are what?   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  Now, I don&apos;t know much about Gomang really. Hamdong and Samlo are big and there are Gungru. I wonder how many khamtsen the Gomang have. The khamtsen gegen of Hamdong and Samlo have the title of the tsogchen shengo, but they don&apos;t have the power. The power rest with only Drepung tsogchen shengo. And there was also one called the Kyomolung [Tib. skor mo lung] shengo and the Drepung shengo and the Hamdong Khamtsen gegen and the Samlo khamtsen gegen. [unclear] and whoever comes to the goverment ceremony [unclear], but the power rest with only Drepung tsogchen shengo.  Another question is what are the ex-abbots of the tratsang and other abbots of the tratsang like Loseling, Shagor and Gyepa and what happens. So traditionally, in Loseling, they are not involved and in functions of Loseling, they don&apos;t exist there. The ex-abbots are not counted and no power and nothing. They don&apos;t even attend the tratsang. If they do so, they cannot function. Similarly, Gyepa Khempo and the Shagor Khempo are part of Loseling and they enjoy the title of the Loseling abbot and they may become Loseling Khempo. It is possible. [unclear] Loseling has only khempo that is the Loseling Khempo.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  And then the tsogchen level has the shengo, right?   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  Yeah, shengo is responsible of the discipline and tsogchen is controlled by laji. Drepung is headed by the khempo tripa, the senior most abbot who is mostly an ex-abbot. The ex-abbots enjoy the title in the tsogchen and they don&apos;t enjoyed in the tratsang at all.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  The khempo tripa is part of laji or no?   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  Khempo tripa has the main responsibility in the laji and he calls the laji he has to do everything.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  How many people in the laji are there?   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  All the ex-abbots and the present abbots and offial rank called phodrang depa.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  Is he appointed as the government representative?   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  Yes, he has the tsidrung title. [unclear] and there are also two shengo, tsogchen umdze and these were probably the big laji [Tib. che khag]. There are three laji, big, middle and small laji. Among the middle laji, there are two ch&#xF6;khang depa [Tib. mchod khang sde pa] in charge the chapels of Drepung one from Loseling ans one from Gomang and Parkhang Depa, [Tib. par khang sde pa] the in charge of the Printing House.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  What is the function of these depa?   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  The two ch&#xF6;khang depa are for over seeing the tsogchen dukhang and taking care of the statues, scriptures and stups [Tib. sku gsung thugs rten] of Drepung. Parkhang Depa takes care of the Printing House.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  Was it a blue printing or block?   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  They only have the block. It was like a library.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  Who appoints the ch&#xF6;khang depa?   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  Probably, the tratsang would submit the name list and the government would approve it and they have a tsidrung titile. Drepung tsogchen umdze is also appointed by the government. Probably, ch&#xF6;khang depa and parkhang depa were also appointed by the government. Phodrang depa is appointed by the government and anything the government comminicate with Drepung, they comminicate with the laji and they comminicate with the phodrang Depa. Phodrang depa informs the khempo tripa and he [unclear]. It is always phodrang Depa involved. [unclear]   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  So the phodrang depa intervened alot, right?   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  Yes, they do alot and phodrang depa is the depa of Ganden Phodrang which acts like the representative of the government. In the small laji [Tib. chung khag], there are the two shengo and the two nangma.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  What nangma does?   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  Under the shengo there are two called nangma and there are two chabril. Each shengo has a chabril and the there are two jama. Probably, the tratsang has only on jama and the tsogchen had two.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  Who handles the estates and like that? Was it chabu?   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  There is no chabu in the laji and all is done by the khempo like giving loans and collectin interests of the loans. When they had a trouble with cases, they send the representative of the laji like the people like Ugyen la would go to see the government officials and Ugyen la would tell me that when he goes to see the Surkhang Sawang Chemo, he would tell him, &quot;Oh chagdampa la have come [Tib. phyag phebs gnang byung]. Today, who are you going to represent for?&quot; Ugyen la would represent the laji, labrang and sometimes the tratsang also.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  Chagdampa is a post, right?   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  Yes, they are sent from Drepung for the M&#xF6;nlam.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  Let&apos;s finish the small laji.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  What about the ex-nangma and ex-shengo?   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  There was no ex-nangma and ex-shengo. The only one who has the ex is the khempo. Some shengo are given the title to enjoy the tsidrung rank and invited into like Tsom&#xF6;nling [Tib. tshe smon gling]. In the case of the 13th Dalai Lama, he has given two shengo the tsidrung rank offcially and then also there are ex-jindag [Tib. sbyin bdag] [sponsor] and who ever enjoy the governmental tsidrung post was also invited into the laji.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  If they come back to the monastery, right?   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  If they are living in the monastery with the rank.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  So it is quite confusing because the abbots were also representing the tratsang, right?   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  Yes. The tratsang abbot will represent the tratsang while he is in office, but the ex-khempo is not put in the tratsang. And there are also the rigji.   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  Rigji have 6 abbots, right?   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  What they come from?   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  They also have a certain land and they have certain business to do. They will give loans and they collect money. Sometimes they hire people.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  What about the [unclear]?   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  Every six years, as I told you during the long break, ch&#xF6;ntsam [Tib. chos mtshams], one khempo is responsible for the tonggo. That period, tratsang has nothing to do. In tsogchen there is an additional mangja. And everyday, the monks are given one dre of tsampa and the chandz&#xF6; will also give a big tonggo. That is the rigtra and each khempo every 6 years....  and there are 6 khempo excluding Ngagpa.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  Is there tonggo every year?   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  Yes.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  That is at the break, ch&#xF6;ntsam [Tib. chos mtshams]?   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  Yes, at the ch&#xF6;ntsam chenmo [Tib. chen mo] which is one and half month.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  When is that?   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  This is the time of the summer retreat from the 17th of 6th lunar month till the 17th of 8th lunar month. I think they give the tonggo for 16 days not during all the time.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  Do the individual khempo make profit of these things?   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  I think the khempo will spend more money on that rather than doing that.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  How do they spend more money?   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  The khempo has a tremendous income of money. If you are appointed as Loseling khempo, you will become multi-millioniar over a time.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  How?   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  Loseling khempo has a shiga. Number two, Whenever Loseling has a traja, the Loseling khempo gets half skin/bag load of butter and half box of tea. It is called, &quot;day tea and day butter&quot;, nyinja nyinmar [Tib. nyin ja nyin mar]. During the ch&#xF6;ntsam, there is no traja.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  Traja means mangja?   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  Mangja is in the tsogchen and traja is in the tratsang. The khamtsen tea is called tsomja [Tib. tshoms ja]. Except during the ch&#xF6;ntsam almost everyday, there is traja like 80% of the year. Now addition to that, every distribution of the monks, the khempo has 11 shares. In addition to that, the Dalai Lama&apos;s throne has 41 shares which goes to the khempo.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  If everyone gets 1 dayang, the khempo gets 11 dayang for oneself and 41 dayang from the Dalai Lama&apos;s throne.   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  This is the amount at least the khempo gets and similarly whenever there is thukpa [unclear] the abbot gets in line where others get mix ed.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  But not the ex-abbot, right?   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  The ex-abbots gets nothing. I am not sure whether the ex-abbots get any other shares other than the tratsang.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  They only get the shares from the tsogchen and the M&#xF6;nlam?   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  Yes.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  Is it possible that the mangja and the tsomja comes on the same day?   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  No. Maybe the same day but not the same time. Mangja is always early in the morning like 6-7 am. And there is another dry tsog [without tea] in the ch&#xF6;ra and the traja is served at about 9.30 till 11.30. The tsomja only starts only at 3 o&apos;clock in the afternoon.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  The monks don&apos;t get the tea if they don&apos;t go?   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  Yes, but the khempo and tr&#xFC;ku would get the share and I am a new tr&#xFC;ku and don&apos;t go to the tsog in the tsogchen I get three shares and if I go, I get four shares. [laughter] In the tratsang, if I go, I get 6 shares and if I don&apos;t, I get 5 shares.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  How do the chandz&#xF6; make the money like the phucha [Tib. phu phyag] and the kongchag [Tib. kong phyag]?   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong> 
 They had many shiga and all the depa were appointed by them and they were also in charge of the nyertsang they send people to some big monasteries like Urgyenla was sent to the labrang of big monastery called Ganden Ch&#xF6;nkhor Ling [Tib. dga&apos; ldan chos &apos;khor gling]. Then the Loseling Tratsang appoints the Tawang Nyerpa [Tib. rta dbang gnyer pa].   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  Was this the nyerpa or the abbot?   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  They have separate abbot. They send both the abbot and the nyerpa.   </p>
