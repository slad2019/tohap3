<p><strong>Q:</strong>  Let&apos;s talk a little bit about <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. &#xF62;&#xFA9;&#xF7A;&#xF0B;&#xF51;&#xFB2;&#xF74;&#xF44;] A monk official in the Tibetan government.">tsidrung</span> (monk officials). I want to get this straight now. You can become a tsidrung through a <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. &#xF64;&#xF42;&#xF0B;&#xF5A;&#xF44;] 1. The household or family of a monk that consisted of multiple monks. 2. The apartment of a monk household.">shagtsang</span>. Can you explain what shagtsang means to you and give some examples, things like that?   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  A <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. &#xF64;&#xF42;&#xF0B;&#xF5A;&#xF44;] 1. The household or family of a monk that consisted of multiple monks. 2. The apartment of a monk household.">shagtsang</span> is such a ... it sort of becomes an institute. A set up sort of system, institutionalized in Tibetan monastic tradition. By having almost an adoption of a junior monk to their own sort of ... a concept of family, after all, how to say?   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  Its like a family then?   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  Yeah, in their social livelihood, whatever, the right sort of livelihood they share together. In other words, they adopt them. The senior people adopt some junior monk, many of them are their nephews, many of them are total strangers. Many of them related, many may not be related. Total strangers are adopted in their house. By adoption it means that the senior has taken total responsibility for their livelihood.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  They look after the young kids?   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  They look after the young ones, try to give them an education, and then they try to feed them and give them clothes.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  They call them <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. &#xF51;&#xF42;&#xF7A;&#xF0B;&#xF55;&#xFB2;&#xF74;&#xF42;] 1. Student. 2. Disciple. 3. Commonly the name for monks living with a gegen or teacher. These are more like wards than real disciples.">gidru</span>, usually?   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  Shagtsang <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. &#xF51;&#xF42;&#xF7A;&#xF0B;&#xF55;&#xFB2;&#xF74;&#xF42;] 1. Student. 2. Disciple. 3. Commonly the name for monks living with a gegen or teacher. These are more like wards than real disciples.">gidru</span> [Tib. &#xF64;&#xF42;&#xF0B;&#xF5A;&#xF44;&#xF0B;&#xF51;&#xF42;&#xF7A;&#xF0B;&#xF55;&#xFB2;&#xF74;&#xF42;]. Shagtsang gidru; the moment you add the gidru in addition you get a <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. &#xF64;&#xF42;&#xF0B;&#xF5A;&#xF44;] 1. The household or family of a monk that consisted of multiple monks. 2. The apartment of a monk household.">shagtsang</span> gidru, it indicates they are sharing their pockets (financially). But a <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. 1. &#xF64;&#xF42;, 2. &#xF5E;&#xF42;] 1. The apartment/room of a monk. 2. The butter fat that coagulates on the top of butter-tea when the tea is left to sit for some time. If the tea had been made with a lot of butter, this layer could be thick enough to scoop off and save to later sell or eat separately. The senior monks are usually served tea with a lot of shag.">shag</span> gi gidru [Tib. &#xF64;&#xF42;&#xF0B;&#xF42;&#xF72;&#xF0B;&#xF51;&#xF42;&#xF7A;&#xF0B;&#xF55;&#xFB2;&#xF74;&#xF42;], if it&apos;s a shag gi gidru, its not necessarily meaning a shagtsang gidru. First, many of them are kept as shag gi gidru.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  And what does that mean, <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. 1. &#xF64;&#xF42;, 2. &#xF5E;&#xF42;] 1. The apartment/room of a monk. 2. The butter fat that coagulates on the top of butter-tea when the tea is left to sit for some time. If the tea had been made with a lot of butter, this layer could be thick enough to scoop off and save to later sell or eat separately. The senior monks are usually served tea with a lot of shag.">shag</span> gi <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. &#xF51;&#xF42;&#xF7A;&#xF0B;&#xF55;&#xFB2;&#xF74;&#xF42;] 1. Student. 2. Disciple. 3. Commonly the name for monks living with a gegen or teacher. These are more like wards than real disciples.">gidru</span>?   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  They, sort of, live in that house, and they are fed by them, but you have no rights over their property or anything. And when you prove that you are good, then they may make you <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. &#xF64;&#xF42;&#xF0B;&#xF5A;&#xF44;] 1. The household or family of a monk that consisted of multiple monks. 2. The apartment of a monk household.">shagtsang</span> gidru without any official declaration, automatically.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  There is no letter or anything? No written contract?   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  No letter or anything. No written contract or anything. Sort of automatically picked out.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  Now these <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. &#xF64;&#xF42;&#xF0B;&#xF5A;&#xF44;] 1. The household or family of a monk that consisted of multiple monks. 2. The apartment of a monk household.">shagtsang</span> have names, or do they not have names?   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  No, no. Or the senior monks, they take it.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  Its their names of senior monks?   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  Their names.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  Like what would be an example?   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  For example, Ugyen La [Tib. &#xF68;&#xF7C;&#xF0B;&#xF62;&#xF92;&#xFB1;&#xF53;&#xF0B;&#xF63;], we have interviewed Ugyen La. Ugyen La had a <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. &#xF64;&#xF42;&#xF0B;&#xF5A;&#xF44;] 1. The household or family of a monk that consisted of multiple monks. 2. The apartment of a monk household.">shagtsang</span> called Thamak Shimpo [Tib. &#xF50;&#xF0B;&#xF58;&#xF0B;&#xF5E;&#xF72;&#xF58;&#xF0B;&#xF54;&#xF7C;]. Thamag Shimpo is not a related to Ugyen La. That was his nickname, Thamak Shimpo was kept by Ugyen La. And so people nicknamed him, he had a good taste in tobacco. Thamak Shimpo this name is also called in <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. &#xF56;&#xFB3;&#xF7C;&#xF0B;&#xF42;&#xF66;&#xF63;&#xF0B;&#xF42;&#xFB3;&#xF72;&#xF44;] One of the main colleges in Drepung Monastery.">Loseling</span> too. Neither Ugyen La nor Thamag Shimpo became shengo.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  Now how did he find that boy? Do you have any idea?   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  Well, then in the monastery there were a lot of young boys. Sometimes you meet them and they just stay.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  But Ugyen La was not like a regular monk, or was he?   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  He is a regular monk.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  That&apos;s right, Ugyen La is in the monastery, he&apos;s not?   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  No, in the monastery. Regular monk, and so he meets.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  Now how about these families like?   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  Now, for instance, Ngawang Th&#xF6;ndup [Tib. &#xF44;&#xF42;&#xF0B;&#xF51;&#xF56;&#xF44;&#xF0B;&#xF51;&#xF7C;&#xF53;&#xF0B;&#xF42;&#xFB2;&#xF74;&#xF56;], he is the <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. &#xF64;&#xF42;&#xF0B;&#xF5A;&#xF44;] 1. The household or family of a monk that consisted of multiple monks. 2. The apartment of a monk household.">shagtsang</span> of Yeshe Lh&#xFC;ndup [Tib. &#xF61;&#xF7A;&#xF0B;&#xF64;&#xF7A;&#xF66;&#xF0B;&#xF63;&#xFB7;&#xF74;&#xF53;&#xF0B;&#xF42;&#xFB2;&#xF74;&#xF56;].   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  Yeshe Lh&#xFC;ndup?   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  Yeshe Lh&#xFC;ndup. They lived just behind our house in Lhasa, you know. They used to run a school in Lhasa. Yeshe Lh&#xFC;ndup ran a school, my brothers went there to learn calligraphy.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  Now Yeshe Lh&#xFC;ndup is what, a <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. &#xF62;&#xFA9;&#xF7A;&#xF0B;&#xF51;&#xFB2;&#xF74;&#xF44;] A monk official in the Tibetan government.">tsidrung</span>?   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  Yeshe Lh&#xFC;ndup is a <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. &#xF62;&#xFA9;&#xF7A;&#xF0B;&#xF51;&#xFB2;&#xF74;&#xF44;] A monk official in the Tibetan government.">tsidrung</span> and he was a tsendr&#xF6;n in Lhasa. Yeshe Lh&#xFC;ndup had two tsidrung, shabd&#xF6;pa [Tib. &#xF5E;&#xF56;&#xF66;&#xF0B;&#xF66;&#xFA1;&#xF7C;&#xF51;&#xF0B;&#xF54;] and the other is Dragten La [Tib. &#xF42;&#xFB2;&#xF42;&#xF66;&#xF0B;&#xF56;&#xF66;&#xF9F;&#xF53;&#xF0B;&#xF63;&#xF42;&#xF66;] in the shagtsang.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  Now, he&apos;s not a shabd&#xF6;pa, would you say? Because Yeshe Lh&#xFC;ndup is also an official. And then, when you said two people from a family are also   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  Dragten la is in Dharamsala and he worked for the Information Office, Dridrag [Tib. &#xF51;&#xFB2;&#xF72;&#xF63;&#xF0B;&#xF56;&#xF66;&#xF92;&#xFB2;&#xF42;&#xF66;] and he interviewed Phala and those people. Another one is Ngawang Th&#xF6;ndrup. But I do not know whether Ngawang Th&#xF6;ndrup is related to Yeshe Lh&#xFC;ndup. I don&apos;t think they are related. I don&apos;t think they are related at all. So he had become <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. &#xF64;&#xF42;&#xF0B;&#xF5A;&#xF44;] 1. The household or family of a monk that consisted of multiple monks. 2. The apartment of a monk household.">shagtsang</span>, but   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  So this <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. &#xF64;&#xF42;&#xF0B;&#xF5A;&#xF44;] 1. The household or family of a monk that consisted of multiple monks. 2. The apartment of a monk household.">shagtsang</span>, he may not have started it, Yeshe Lh&#xFC;ndup. He may have been the shagtsang&apos;s <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. &#xF51;&#xF42;&#xF7A;&#xF0B;&#xF55;&#xFB2;&#xF74;&#xF42;] 1. Student. 2. Disciple. 3.

<p><strong>A:</strong>  I don&apos;t know. He might have been, I don&apos;t know.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  But it continues? The property continues?   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  Continues, yes.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  So you would say that most of the <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. &#xF62;&#xFA9;&#xF7A;&#xF0B;&#xF51;&#xFB2;&#xF74;&#xF44;] A monk official in the Tibetan government.">tsidrung</span>?   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  Many. Most of them, most of them. And then, when you have a capable <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. &#xF62;&#xFA9;&#xF7A;&#xF0B;&#xF51;&#xFB2;&#xF74;&#xF44;] A monk official in the Tibetan government.">tsidrung</span>, then you get some, sort of stayed here and there. Like Jokteng <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. &#xF51;&#xFB2;&#xF74;&#xF44;&#xF0B;&#xF61;&#xF72;&#xF42;&#xF0B;&#xF46;&#xF7A;&#xF53;&#xF0B;&#xF58;&#xF7C;] The title of the four heads of the Yigtsang Office (Ecclesiastics Office).">drunyichemmo</span> Jokteng Talama [Tib. &#xF63;&#xF95;&#xF7C;&#xF42;&#xF0B;&#xF66;&#xF9F;&#xF7A;&#xF44;&#xF0B;&#xF4F;&#xF0B;&#xF56;&#xFB3;&#xF0B;&#xF58;], he was an ordinary monk, totally ordinary. And he had been working with <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. &#xF58;&#xF42;&#xFB2;&#xF7C;&#xF53;&#xF0B;&#xF42;&#xF49;&#xF7A;&#xF62;&#xF0B;&#xF46;&#xF7A;&#xF53;&#xF0B;&#xF58;&#xF7C;] 1. The Dalai Lama&apos;s Lord Chamberlain. He was one of the most important monk officials in the Tibetan government and was the head of the Tse ga, the Dalai Lama&apos;s secretariat. 2. A high economic managerial position in some large monasteries.">dr&#xF6;nyerchemmo</span> Absog [Tib. &#xF68;&#xF56;&#xF0B;&#xF66;&#xF7C;&#xF42;].   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  He had been working for him, you mean?   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  For him. Like a semi-servant type of thing. Later, he became Rong Namse, [Tib. &#xF62;&#xF7C;&#xF44;&#xF0B;&#xF62;&#xFA3;&#xF58;&#xF0B;&#xF66;&#xFB2;&#xF66;] and he got a big estate called Rong Namse. So officially known as Namse, rather than Jogteng.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  So what happens when somebody says he wants to become his <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. &#xF51;&#xF42;&#xF7A;&#xF0B;&#xF55;&#xFB2;&#xF74;&#xF42;] 1. Student. 2. Disciple. 3. Commonly the name for monks living with a gegen or teacher. These are more like wards than real disciples.">gidru</span>, they start to give him an education so he can go in and become gidru?   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  Yes, that&apos;s it. That is exactly how it happens.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  So what happens, then, is that what? They hire a private teacher first?   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  No, no. They send him to the school, normal regular school.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  But this is a private school?   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  Private school. But like Yeshe Lh&#xFC;ndub, he&apos;s running his own school. So, like that. And it&apos;s a funny way to say, you know, a lot of senior monks pick up, many of them pick up some junior.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  A boyfriend?   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  Sort of boyfriend, semi-boyfriend. A lot of people think its homosexual, but its not really homosexual.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  Then what is it?   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  It&apos;s a different system. Totally different.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  How can it be totally different?   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  Its totally different.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  Why?   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  They don&apos;t use any of those things that normal people use.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  What do they use, then?   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  They only use   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  Sort of like in-between the legs?   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  In-between, yes.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  But that&apos;s the same thing?   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  You call it the same, okay, but that&apos;s different. Anyway, so they sort of invite them.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  What is that called? What&apos;s the term to make love to somebody like that?   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  Normally refer to it as boy-boy [Tib. &#xF66;&#xFA4;&#xF74;&#xF0B;&#xF42;&#xF74;&#xF0B;&#xF66;&#xFA4;&#xF74;&#xF0B;&#xF42;&#xF74;], you know.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  No, but the doing of that   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  They don&apos;t really, you know, they don&apos;t have a big name for it. Sort of, you know, . In fact, many of the <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. &#xF64;&#xF42;&#xF0B;&#xF5A;&#xF44;] 1. The household or family of a monk that consisted of multiple monks. 2. The apartment of a monk household.">shagtsang</span> are like that. Another thing is senior officials, you know, like big officials, I do not know what sort of Jogteng relation to <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. &#xF58;&#xF42;&#xFB2;&#xF7C;&#xF53;&#xF0B;&#xF42;&#xF49;&#xF7A;&#xF62;&#xF0B;&#xF46;&#xF7A;&#xF53;&#xF0B;&#xF58;&#xF7C;] 1. The Dalai Lama&apos;s Lord Chamberlain. He was one of the most important monk officials in the Tibetan government and was the head of the Tse ga, the Dalai Lama&apos;s secretariat. 2. A high economic managerial position in some large monasteries.">dr&#xF6;nyerchemmo</span> Absog. But definitely helped Jogteng to work in the Dalai Lama&apos;s private secretary during the 13th Dalai Lama&apos;s period. There was also Tarala [Tib. &#xF62;&#xF9F;&#xF0B;&#xF62;&#xF0B;&#xF63;&#xF42;&#xF66;] who is in Dharamsala working under Jogteng in Lhasa. Jogteng also has the shabd&#xF6;pa and there were three of them; Nyima La, [Tib. &#xF49;&#xF72;&#xF0B;&#xF58;&#xF0B;&#xF63;&#xF42;&#xF66;] and Genla, [Tib. &#xF62;&#xF92;&#xF53;&#xF0B;&#xF63;&#xF42;&#xF66;] both in America and Kelsang La [Tib. &#xF66;&#xF90;&#xF63;&#xF0B;&#xF56;&#xF5F;&#xF44;&#xF0B;&#xF63;&#xF42;&#xF66;].   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  Now why would he have three?   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  They&apos;re his nephews, they&apos;re related, he picked his relatives. So he made it three because he&apos;s not rich. I don&apos;t think the <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. &#xF62;&#xFA9;&#xF7A;&#xF0B;&#xF51;&#xFB2;&#xF74;&#xF44;] A monk official in the Tibetan government.">tsidrung</span> really needed any sort of estate. But then maybe he hoped he would get an estate later, I don&apos;t know. But I don&apos;t think they really needed an estate like do.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  Then how do they live?   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  Well, the <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. &#xF64;&#xF42;&#xF0B;&#xF5A;&#xF44;] 1. The household or family of a monk that consisted of multiple monks. 2. The apartment of a monk household.">shagtsang</span> are rich.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  Yeah, but what are they rich from? What do they use for income?   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  Like you talk about estates, he goes to Namse, that&apos;s very big, a big estate. And then he&apos;s powerful, very powerful. So, you know, a little bit of visitors. So they all generate income through many ways. And whenever anybody had any problems in any office, the officials concerned are bound to give a lot of financial benefits, on both sides.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  But that only helps the big officers?   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  They have several means.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  But that&apos;s the big ones. How about the small ones? How do they make a living?   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  The small ones I think they have a little problem. Because I do remember and even heard that ... not even heard, but even I have seen it, some junior shabd&#xF6;pa they find it very difficult to manage. Many of them.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  Like, give some examples of that.   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  Like take for example. There&apos;s one <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. &#xF62;&#xFA9;&#xF7A;&#xF0B;&#xF51;&#xFB2;&#xF74;&#xF44;] A monk official in the Tibetan government.">tsidrung</span> called Thubten Rigchog [Tib. &#xF50;&#xF74;&#xF56;&#xF0B;&#xF56;&#xF66;&#xF9F;&#xF53;&#xF0B;&#xF62;&#xF72;&#xF42;&#xF0B;&#xF58;&#xF46;&#xF7C;&#xF42;] who later became the father of <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. &#xF66;&#xF9F;&#xF42;&#xF0B;&#xF56;&#xFB2;&#xF42;] The regent of Tibet who replaced Reting in 1941 and served until 1950 when the 14th Dalai Lama assumed power.">Taktra</span> reincarnation. He was from <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. &#xF56;&#xF5E;&#xF72;&#xF0B;&#xF66;&#xFA1;&#xF7A;] The monastery/labrang of Reting Rimpoche in Lhasa.">Shide</span> [Tib. &#xF56;&#xF5E;&#xF72;&#xF0B;&#xF66;&#xFA1;&#xF7A;], Reting Rimpoche&apos;s monastery. And he did one official post called Jimi [Tib. &#xF66;&#xFA4;&#xFB1;&#xF72;&#xF0B;&#xF58;&#xF72;] in Shide [Tib. &#xF56;&#xF5E;&#xF72;&#xF0B;&#xF66;&#xFA1;&#xF7A;] [monastery]. And after that I don&apos;t know what happened. He used to live in one of the outdoor houses on the outside of our house. He was a moyen [Tib. &#xF58;&#xF7C;&#xF0B;&#xF61;&#xF53;] (tenant), he doesn&apos;t even have a house. He had a little apartment bordered on house.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  Moyen is what?   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  Moyen is a tenant. It&apos;s not really a tenant in the western sense, because in the western sense the tenants will occupy the better and bigger and more important houses because they pay the rent. But in the Tibetan tradition, the moyen will not occupy the good and better houses. The better houses and everything will be kept for the families and they use it. They don&apos;t want anybody inside your own courtyard. So the outside courtyard, outside the walls, they rent it out to small families. Those are called moyen. And they have to pay minimum rent, very nominal rent, and they have a duty to clean the area out. And sometimes the family will ask them to help here, help there, so the moyen come and help.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  Now how did this guy get into become a <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. &#xF62;&#xFA9;&#xF7A;&#xF0B;&#xF51;&#xFB2;&#xF74;&#xF44;] A monk official in the Tibetan government.">tsidrung</span>?   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  I do not know how he became a tsidrung. But he is a tsidrung. And he is poor. Not very poor, there are more that are poorer than him, though he is poor. He used to borrow clothes and horses and things from us all the time because he didn&apos;t really have enough. And he and his family, wife, they are living together.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  He had a wife even though he was a <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. &#xF62;&#xFA9;&#xF7A;&#xF0B;&#xF51;&#xFB2;&#xF74;&#xF44;] A monk official in the Tibetan government.">tsidrung</span>?   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  Even though he was a <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. &#xF62;&#xFA9;&#xF7A;&#xF0B;&#xF51;&#xFB2;&#xF74;&#xF44;] A monk official in the Tibetan government.">tsidrung</span>, he had a wife. But later he became the father, so he was demoted. He was thrown out because it became open.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  What about ... can you think of any cases when ... let&apos;s say there are like <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. &#xF41;&#xF58;&#xF66;&#xF0B;&#xF54;] A person from the Kham region, a Tibetan from the Khamba (Khampa) sub-cultural group.">Khamba</span> traders and they want to make their kid, like better, so   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  Well, there are <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. &#xF41;&#xF58;&#xF66;&#xF0B;&#xF54;] A person from the Kham region, a Tibetan from the Khamba (Khampa) sub-cultural group.">Khamba</span> traders like <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. &#xF66;&#xF0B;&#xF60;&#xF51;&#xF74;&#xF63;&#xF0B;&#xF5A;&#xF44;] A Khamba trading family that became Tibetan government officials.">Sandutsang</span> Rinchen [Tib. &#xF66;&#xF0B;&#xF60;&#xF51;&#xF74;&#xF0B;&#xF5A;&#xF44;&#xF0B;&#xF62;&#xF72;&#xF53;&#xF0B;&#xF46;&#xF7A;&#xF53;] and there was a Sumdo Gyentsen Y&#xF6;nten [Tib. &#xF66;&#xF74;&#xF58;&#xF0B;&#xF58;&#xF51;&#xF7C;&#xF0B;&#xF62;&#xF92;&#xFB1;&#xF63;&#xF0B;&#xF58;&#xF5A;&#xF53;&#xF0B;&#xF61;&#xF7C;&#xF53;&#xF0B;&#xF4F;&#xF53;] and even <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. &#xF66;&#xF0B;&#xF60;&#xF51;&#xF74;&#xF63;] Abbr. A Khamba trading family that became Tibetan government officials.">Sandu</span> Gyurmey la [Tib. &#xF60;&#xF42;&#xFB1;&#xF74;&#xF62;&#xF0B;&#xF58;&#xF7A;&#xF51;&#xF0B;&#xF63;&#xF42;&#xF66;] and all these, they have the rank.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  They were all <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. &#xF62;&#xFA9;&#xF7A;&#xF0B;&#xF51;&#xFB2;&#xF74;&#xF44;] A monk official in the Tibetan government.">tsidrung</span>?   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  No, they are all lay official, drungkhor [Tib. &#xF51;&#xFB2;&#xF74;&#xF44;&#xF0B;&#xF60;&#xF41;&#xF7C;&#xF62;].   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  No, I&apos;m talking about <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. &#xF41;&#xF58;&#xF66;&#xF0B;&#xF54;] A person from the Kham region, a Tibetan from the Khamba (Khampa) sub-cultural group.">Khamba</span> traders. I mean, like, you know, middle-class people who have some money but no status. So they want their kids to have status.   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  Then they can contact any one of those big <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. &#xF62;&#xFA9;&#xF7A;&#xF0B;&#xF51;&#xFB2;&#xF74;&#xF44;] A monk official in the Tibetan government.">tsidrung</span> or something. Under the protection of the <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. &#xF64;&#xF42;&#xF0B;&#xF5A;&#xF44;] 1. The household or family of a monk that consisted of multiple monks. 2. The apartment of a monk household.">shagtsang</span> they can get the tsidrung.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  They would then say ... they would probably have to give the <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. &#xF64;&#xF42;&#xF0B;&#xF5A;&#xF44;] 1. The household or family of a monk that consisted of multiple monks. 2. The apartment of a monk household.">shagtsang</span> something, I don&apos;t know?   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  I don&apos;t think they do. It depends on their relations. Some close friends, they give ... I think they ... What really happens is the <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. &#xF62;&#xFA9;&#xF7A;&#xF0B;&#xF51;&#xFB2;&#xF74;&#xF44;] A monk official in the Tibetan government.">tsidrung</span> in the <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. &#xF64;&#xF42;&#xF0B;&#xF5A;&#xF44;] 1. The household or family of a monk that consisted of multiple monks. 2. The apartment of a monk household.">shagtsang</span>, or whoever, I think he has to guarantee the character and the obedience has to be guaranteed. And I believe tsidrung have more commitment than the drungkhor to the government. They have to guarantee, wherever they send them they will go, wherever they put them they will stay [Tib. &#xF56;&#xF4F;&#xF44;&#xF0B;&#xF60;&#xF42;&#xFB2;&#xF7C;&#xF0B;&#xF56;&#xF5E;&#xF42;&#xF0B;&#xF66;&#xFA1;&#xF7C;&#xF51;&#xF0B;&#xF60;&#xF55;&#xF7A;&#xF62;&#xF0B;&#xF56;].   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  Can you spell that again?   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  [Tib. &#xF56;&#xF4F;&#xF44;&#xF0B;&#xF60;&#xF42;&#xFB2;&#xF7C;&#xF0B;&#xF56;&#xF5E;&#xF42;&#xF0B;&#xF66;&#xFA1;&#xF7C;&#xF51;&#xF0B;&#xF60;&#xF55;&#xF7A;&#xF62;&#xF0B;&#xF56;]. I don&apos;t think the drungkhor have that. How do I know this? Because when Ph&#xFC;nkhang Jedrung La [Tib. &#xF55;&#xF74;&#xF53;&#xF0B;&#xF41;&#xF44;&#xF0B;&#xF62;&#xF97;&#xF7A;&#xF0B;&#xF51;&#xFB2;&#xF74;&#xF44;&#xF0B;&#xF63;&#xF42;&#xF66;] was demoted, one of the excuses, or the reason why, they used is he&apos;s a <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. &#xF62;&#xFA9;&#xF7A;&#xF0B;&#xF51;&#xFB2;&#xF74;&#xF44;] A monk official in the Tibetan government.">tsidrung</span>. the tsidrung, they ask for, you know, they have the more things because they are not supposed to be a family. So they are supposed be isolated, and wherever they are sent they will go and stay. And the lay officials, drungkhor [Tib. &#xF51;&#xFB2;&#xF74;&#xF44;&#xF0B;&#xF60;&#xF41;&#xF7C;&#xF62;] have a little excuse because they are from family and all this. The tsidrung don&apos;t have that.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  So the <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. &#xF64;&#xF42;&#xF0B;&#xF5A;&#xF44;] 1. The household or family of a monk that consisted of multiple monks. 2. The apartment of a monk household.">shagtsang</span> has to guarantee this person?   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  Guarantee this person. I think that&apos;s why the <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. &#xF64;&#xF42;&#xF0B;&#xF5A;&#xF44;] 1. The household or family of a monk that consisted of multiple monks. 2. The apartment of a monk household.">shagtsang</span> has to guarantee. As long as they have good officials who have guaranteed you, and I think anybody can become <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. &#xF62;&#xFA9;&#xF7A;&#xF0B;&#xF51;&#xFB2;&#xF74;&#xF44;] A monk official in the Tibetan government.">tsidrung</span> if you know how to read and write.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  If you know how to read and write?   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  If you know how to read and write. But there are examples of <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. &#xF62;&#xFA9;&#xF7A;&#xF0B;&#xF51;&#xFB2;&#xF74;&#xF44;] A monk official in the Tibetan government.">tsidrung</span> who don&apos;t know how to write and read.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  In modern times?   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  Yes.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  Who?   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  Khenjung Lobsang Gyentsen [Tib. &#xF56;&#xFB3;&#xF7C;&#xF0B;&#xF56;&#xF5F;&#xF44;&#xF0B;&#xF62;&#xF92;&#xFB1;&#xF63;&#xF0B;&#xF58;&#xF5A;&#xF53;].   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  Really?   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  Yes. He can barely write. I was really shocked. Because, you know why, when I was first working in the Tibet House, that was in 65, we had a meeting and I was acting secretary, and Maya [Tib. &#xF62;&#xFA8;&#xF0B;&#xF56;&#xFB1;] was there and three other <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. &#xF62;&#xFA9;&#xF7A;&#xF0B;&#xF51;&#xFB2;&#xF74;&#xF44;] A monk official in the Tibetan government.">tsidrung</span> were there. So I thought Lobsang Gyentsen was the senior-most because he was the Khenjung, so I brought writing paper and a pen to him and said &quot;please take notes down&quot;. And he kept on saying, &quot;how can I do it&quot; [Tib. &#xF63;&#xF0B;&#xF51;&#xF54;&#xF7A;&#xF0B;&#xF66;&#xFB2;&#xF72;&#xF51;&#xF0B;&#xF54;&#xF66;]. So I didn&apos;t know about it, and then Maya volunteered instead and took all the notes. So I was not aware of it. And later they told me that he does not write. It was true. But he had become <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. &#xF58;&#xF41;&#xF53;&#xF0B;&#xF46;&#xF74;&#xF44;] A rank/title for monk officials that was equal to 4th rank (tib. &#xF62;&#xF72;&#xF58;&#xF0B;&#xF56;&#xF5E;&#xF72;) officials in the lay aristocratic side of the traditional government bureaucracy.">khenjung</span>. But his case is different. Because he was a servant of Jigyab Khempo, who went down to collect this Dalai Lama. And he had served very gratefully to His Holiness and brought him to Lhasa. And as a reward he was given the status of a shungshab. And then he had been promoted to become a khenjung, and then became the Shigatse <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. &#xF66;&#xFA4;&#xFB1;&#xF72;&#xF0B;&#xF62;&#xFAB;&#xF7C;&#xF44;] Refers to Shigatse dzong as well as the 2 heads of the Shigatse dzong while the Panchen Lama was in exile. After he returned in 1952, the 2 heads of Shigatse dzong were just called Dzongp&#xF6;n.">Jidzong</span> [Tib. &#xF42;&#xF5E;&#xF72;&#xF66;&#xF0B;&#xF40;&#xF0B;&#xF62;&#xFA9;&#xF7A;&#xF0B;&#xF66;&#xFA4;&#xFB1;&#xF72;&#xF0B;&#xF62;&#xFAB;&#xF7C;&#xF44;] and then became the Head of the Trade Mission [Tib. &#xF5A;&#xF7C;&#xF44;&#xF0B;&#xF66;&#xFA4;&#xFB1;&#xF72;] in India. Up to that much he went.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  Now these guys, they don&apos;t have to go in through the tse <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. &#xF66;&#xFB3;&#xF7C;&#xF56;&#xF0B;&#xF42;&#xFB2;&#xFAD;] School.">labdra</span>?   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  Not necessary. I think <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. &#xF62;&#xFA9;&#xF7A;&#xF0B;&#xF51;&#xFB2;&#xF74;&#xF44;] A monk official in the Tibetan government.">tsidrung</span> come in through three different ways: one through the <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. &#xF64;&#xF42;&#xF0B;&#xF5A;&#xF44;] 1. The household or family of a monk that consisted of multiple monks. 2. The apartment of a monk household.">shagtsang</span>, one through the tse <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. &#xF66;&#xFB3;&#xF7C;&#xF56;&#xF0B;&#xF42;&#xFB2;&#xFAD;] School.">labdra</span>, and the third one is when the officials are short, then they have the collection, <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. &#xF42;&#xFB2;&#xFAD;&#xF0B;&#xF60;&#xF55;&#xFB1;&#xF42;&#xF66;] 1.

Boys conscripted to becomes monks in a monastery.">trachag</span> [Tib. &#xF42;&#xFB2;&#xFAD;&#xF0B;&#xF60;&#xF55;&#xFB1;&#xF42;&#xF66;]   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  Trachag&apos;s spelling is?   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  [Tib. &#xF42;&#xFB2;&#xFAD;&#xF0B;&#xF60;&#xF55;&#xFB1;&#xF42;&#xF66;] When they did the <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. &#xF42;&#xFB2;&#xFAD;&#xF0B;&#xF60;&#xF55;&#xFB1;&#xF42;&#xF66;] 1. Monks conscripted by the government to undergo training to become monk officials in the traditional Tibetan government. 2. Boys conscripted to becomes monks in a monastery.">trachag</span>, I think the trachag are normally put through the tselabdra, unless there is an exceptional thing.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  But that must be ... in your lifetime you don&apos;t remember any time that happened?   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  I do.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  You do?   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  Yes. When the Reform Office, Legj&#xF6; [Tib. &#xF63;&#xF7A;&#xF42;&#xF66;&#xF0B;&#xF56;&#xF45;&#xF7C;&#xF66;] was established in Lhasa ...   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  Legj&#xF6; was 1954, right?   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  1954. At that time there was a shortage of government staff and they did that, they collected. But when they collected them, they didn&apos;t put people into the tse labdra. They collected a senior official, <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. &#xF62;&#xFA9;&#xF7A;&#xF0B;&#xF51;&#xFB2;&#xF74;&#xF44;] A monk official in the Tibetan government.">tsidrung</span>, a few of them, semi-government officials, semi-monastery representatives sort of combined with the they give the tsidrung rank. That I do remember.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  But other than that, what happens in the old society?   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  Other than that, what happens is they collect <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. &#xF42;&#xFB2;&#xFAD;&#xF0B;&#xF60;&#xF55;&#xFB1;&#xF42;&#xF66;] 1. Monks conscripted by the government to undergo training to become monk officials in the traditional Tibetan government. 2. Boys conscripted to becomes monks in a monastery.">trachag</span> as young monks and put them in the tse labdra.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  No, but in your experience?   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  No.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  I think what happened is that in modern times <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. &#xF62;&#xFA9;&#xF7A;&#xF0B;&#xF51;&#xFB2;&#xF74;&#xF44;] A monk official in the Tibetan government.">tsidrung</span> became totally separate from the monastery. In other words, not mainly monks from the monastery, but a separate group of people.   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  A separate group. But what happened is from the monastery point of view, they really feel that <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. &#xF62;&#xFA9;&#xF7A;&#xF0B;&#xF51;&#xFB2;&#xF74;&#xF44;] A monk official in the Tibetan government.">tsidrung</span> are part and parcel of the monastery because they have to join either one of the monasteries before they become tsidrung.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  Yeah, but they don&apos;t have to stay in the monastery?   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  They don&apos;t have to stay, but they have to join in. So after that, whether they became a monk or not, it doesn&apos;t matter, they don&apos;t really bother to put their name or take up their name or anything. They don&apos;t even ... they totally ignore the monastery. But from the monastery point of view they still keep. They say &quot;he&apos;s ours&quot;. They even give share of alms [Tib. &#xF66;&#xF90;&#xF63;&#xF0B;&#xF56;]. So, you know, not all the alms, but some important they give, even during the M&#xF6;nlam they the give them the tea to taste, tshabsi [Tib. &#xF5A;&#xFAD;&#xF0B;&#xF42;&#xF5F;&#xF72;&#xF42;&#xF66;], because they even set their teas and all this sort of thing. Yeah, they do it, monks they do it. But from the officials side they ignore. They sort of already moved.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  Even the poorer <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. &#xF62;&#xFA9;&#xF7A;&#xF0B;&#xF51;&#xFB2;&#xF74;&#xF44;] A monk official in the Tibetan government.">tsidrung</span>?   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  It depends mostly on the individual. Some very high officials, like Jogteng sort of thing, they will really sort of bind themselves with the monastery very strongly, because they get the support. But then, you know, in-between people, they will ignore the monastery. They will sort of over-look them and laugh and, you know, sort of funny things they will do.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  So that&apos;s the tse labra, the second one is <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. &#xF64;&#xF42;&#xF0B;&#xF5A;&#xF44;] 1. The household or family of a monk that consisted of multiple monks. 2. The apartment of a monk household.">shagtsang</span>, and the third one is   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  The <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. &#xF42;&#xFB2;&#xFAD;&#xF0B;&#xF60;&#xF55;&#xFB1;&#xF42;&#xF66;] 1. Monks conscripted by the government to undergo training to become monk officials in the traditional Tibetan government. 2. Boys conscripted to becomes monks in a monastery.">trachag</span>, the trachag was too.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  But the tse <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. &#xF66;&#xFB3;&#xF7C;&#xF56;&#xF0B;&#xF42;&#xFB2;&#xFAD;] School.">labdra</span> was, just like   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  Tselabdra was also established at about the 13th Dalai Lama&apos;s period, I think, not before that.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  Oh really?   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  I think so. Because <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. &#xF62;&#xFA9;&#xF7A;&#xF0B;&#xF51;&#xFB2;&#xF74;&#xF44;] A monk official in the Tibetan government.">tsidrung</span> are not really good at the language and writing. Writing and all this are not so good as drungkhor, so in order to improve that, I think he established the tse labdra. If I&apos;m not mistaken, I think he did.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  The tse <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. &#xF66;&#xFB3;&#xF7C;&#xF56;&#xF0B;&#xF42;&#xFB2;&#xFAD;] School.">labdra</span> is just a school to teach people?   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  A school.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  Then you have to go to the mibab janshu [Tib. &#xF58;&#xF72;&#xF0B;&#xF56;&#xF56;&#xF0B;&#xF66;&#xFA4;&#xFB1;&#xF53;&#xF0B;&#xF5E;&#xF74;] [to show how you look]?   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  Then you have to go to the mibab janshu.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  But if you are <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. &#xF64;&#xF42;&#xF0B;&#xF5A;&#xF44;] 1. The household or family of a monk that consisted of multiple monks. 2. The apartment of a monk household.">shagtsang</span>, you can go to the mibab janshu, or if you go through the tse <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. &#xF66;&#xFB3;&#xF7C;&#xF56;&#xF0B;&#xF42;&#xFB2;&#xFAD;] School.">labdra</span> you can do?   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  I think mibab janshu both can be done. Both can be done, yes.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  I mean, basically everybody has go to mibab janshu?   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  Yes.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  But then, the avenues to get in, if you&apos;re in tse <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. &#xF66;&#xFB3;&#xF7C;&#xF56;&#xF0B;&#xF42;&#xFB2;&#xFAD;] School.">labdra</span>, people in the government know you?   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  Yes.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  And how do you get to the tse <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. &#xF66;&#xFB3;&#xF7C;&#xF56;&#xF0B;&#xF42;&#xFB2;&#xFAD;] School.">labdra</span>? Is that easy or is that hard? Ngawang Th&#xF6;ndrup was in tse labdra.   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  To get into tse <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. &#xF66;&#xFB3;&#xF7C;&#xF56;&#xF0B;&#xF42;&#xFB2;&#xFAD;] School.">labdra</span> may not be so hard. But to get from tse labdra into to become the <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. &#xF62;&#xFA9;&#xF7A;&#xF0B;&#xF51;&#xFB2;&#xF74;&#xF44;] A monk official in the Tibetan government.">tsidrung</span> is hard, because there are many very old tse labdra. They all want that, you know, you couldn&apos;t even get to tsidrung at all, and all most their lives to remain at tse labdra.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  So what do they do when they get old?   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  Well they just sit there and remain students at the tse <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. &#xF66;&#xFB3;&#xF7C;&#xF56;&#xF0B;&#xF42;&#xFB2;&#xFAD;] School.">labdra</span>, you know.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  They must do some kind of work or something, no?   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  I don&apos;t think so. They just attend regular classes, keep on attending all the time. They have an exam, an exam that I think they keep on taking all the time. I don&apos;t think they have a limit, like if you take it three times you throw it out or something like that, you don&apos;t have that. And many of them remain a long, long time.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  So the   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  Even the tse <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. &#xF66;&#xFB3;&#xF7C;&#xF56;&#xF0B;&#xF42;&#xFB2;&#xFAD;] School.">labdra</span>, to become a shabd&#xF6;gpa you have to have a lot of exercise too.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  But what&apos;s the origin of, like Lhalungpa [Tib. &#xF63;&#xFB7;&#xF0B;&#xF63;&#xF74;&#xF44;&#xF0B;&#xF54;], what does he come from?   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  Yes, Lhalungpa, I think he is related to Drumpa Ch&#xF6;sur [Tib. bhrum pa chos zur].   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  Not the one from the 14th Dalai Lama, not that, the 13th Dalai Lama?   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  No, the 13th Dalai Lama died.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  That one?   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  No, Gowo Ch&#xF6;sur [Tib. &#xF42;&#xF7C;&#xF0B;&#xF56;&#xF7C;&#xF0B;&#xF46;&#xF7C;&#xF66;&#xF0B;&#xF5F;&#xF74;&#xF62;] was the one who had trouble with the 13th Dalai Lama&apos;s death, and then I think thereafter is the Drumpa Ch&#xF6;sur. He has also become the ch&#xF6;sur. I don&apos;t know why, but Lhalungpa is related to the Drumpa Ch&#xF6;sur.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  Ch&#xF6;sur is?   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  Ch&#xF6;sur is the ex-oracle [Tib. ch&#xF6; rje zur pa]. So, Lhalungpa is, I think, from Drumpa Ch&#xF6;sur&apos;s shagtsang.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  I see. So, did they make money from their jobs? They get some money, some kind of rate or something? From the officers, they get something?   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  I think only later, I don&apos;t think they had much. I don&apos;t think they have much. Anything from the government, I don&apos;t think they get much. You know, originally, they get the <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. &#xF51;&#xFB2;&#xF74;&#xF44;&#xF0B;&#xF47;] The daily meeting of Tibetan government monk officials (tsedrung) at which tea was provided. However, unlike the collective meetings of monks in monasteries, there was no collective chanting of prayers at the Drungja. The event started at around 9 a.m. and lasted for about an hour. When the Tse ga (the Dalai Lama&apos;s Secretariat) was in the Potala, it was held there, and when it was in the Norbulinga Summer Palace, it was held there. All monk officials in Lhasa were expected to attend.">drungja</span> all the <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. &#xF62;&#xFA9;&#xF7A;&#xF0B;&#xF51;&#xFB2;&#xF74;&#xF44;] A monk official in the Tibetan government.">tsidrung</span> they attend drungja. They are supposed to eat there, you know. They are supposed to be monks, and they don&apos;t have much to worry about, they have drungja, they will give the tea, and they give the <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. &#xF62;&#xFA9;&#xF58;&#xF0B;&#xF54;] The traditional Tibetan staple food that consists of grain that is roasted (popped), usually in sand, and then ground into a flour.">tsampa</span> there, so you eat there.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  But that&apos;s only once a day?   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  That&apos;s only once a day, but the monks are supposed to eat only once a day. According to the Vinaya rules. Not only once a day, but before that they are supposed to. They are not supposed to eat after that.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  During the 13th Dalai Lama&apos;s time it was when, in the morning or in the afternoon?   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  He changed it in the afternoon, rather late afternoon, after the office hours because of the K&#xFC;nphela. [Tib. &#xF40;&#xF74;&#xF53;&#xF0B;&#xF60;&#xF55;&#xF7A;&#xF63;&#xF0B;&#xF63;&#xF42;&#xF66;] They have to wait until the K&#xFC;nphela, from Trapchi.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  So he made it in the afternoon?   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  He made it in the later afternoon. It became symbolic in any case by that time.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  And then later?   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  Later in the morning. What I remember it was always in the morning. Always in the morning.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  That makes sense because during the time of <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. &#xF63;&#xF74;&#xF44;&#xF0B;&#xF64;&#xF62;] The family name of a famous aristocratic lay official during the time of the 13th Dalai Lama and the Regent Reting.">Lungshar</span> [Tib. &#xF63;&#xF74;&#xF44;&#xF0B;&#xF64;&#xF62;] it must have been in the afternoon because then they would go home. Because in the morning then they would go to the office, right?   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  In case it was in order of anything, then they would hold the <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. &#xF51;&#xFB2;&#xF74;&#xF44;&#xF0B;&#xF47;] The daily meeting of Tibetan government monk officials (tsedrung) at which tea was provided. However, unlike the collective meetings of monks in monasteries, there was no collective chanting of prayers at the Drungja. The event started at around 9 a.m. and lasted for about an hour.

All monk officials in Lhasa were expected to attend.">drungja</span> for a longer period.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  If there was any   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  Any special ceremonies, or some promotion, demotion, all these things announcing anything. Then they would hold it for a little bit longer than usual. Otherwise, they would come in and sit down and have some tea first, and would eat the <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. &#xF66;&#xFA4;&#xF42;&#xF66;] A staple Tibetan dish of tsampa mixed with tea and kneaded into balls of dough-like consistency.">pag</span>, and then go. That&apos;s what the <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. &#xF51;&#xFB2;&#xF74;&#xF44;&#xF0B;&#xF47;] The daily meeting of Tibetan government monk officials (tsedrung) at which tea was provided.

All monk officials in Lhasa were expected to attend.">drungja</span> is. So the <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. &#xF62;&#xFA9;&#xF7A;&#xF0B;&#xF51;&#xFB2;&#xF74;&#xF44;] A monk official in the Tibetan government.">tsidrung</span>, they don&apos;t have to stay as long as the drungkhor do, because they are supposed to be monks, and the monks are not supposed to have so many things, so they are supposed to eat there, and back in the office. They don&apos;t have to go into town. The original idea I think goes back to .   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  Then it seems that there is another group of <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. &#xF62;&#xFA9;&#xF7A;&#xF0B;&#xF51;&#xFB2;&#xF74;&#xF44;] A monk official in the Tibetan government.">tsidrung</span> who are from the monasteries, like Tengyeling [Tib. &#xF56;&#xF66;&#xF9F;&#xF53;&#xF0B;&#xF62;&#xF92;&#xFB1;&#xF66;&#xF0B;&#xF42;&#xFB3;&#xF72;&#xF44;] or Reting and those, who become shabd&#xF6;pa?   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  Reting, we don&apos;t count that.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  So those are not really <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. &#xF64;&#xF42;&#xF0B;&#xF5A;&#xF44;] 1. The household or family of a monk that consisted of multiple monks. 2. The apartment of a monk household.">shagtsang</span>?   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  Not really <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. &#xF64;&#xF42;&#xF0B;&#xF5A;&#xF44;] 1. The household or family of a monk that consisted of multiple monks. 2. The apartment of a monk household.">shagtsang</span>, but then they&apos;re sort of   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  I assume they would be helped by people in <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. &#xF56;&#xF5E;&#xF72;&#xF0B;&#xF66;&#xFA1;&#xF7A;] The monastery/labrang of Reting Rimpoche in Lhasa.">Shide</span> [Tib. &#xF56;&#xF5E;&#xF72;&#xF0B;&#xF66;&#xFA1;&#xF7A;] or   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  Like, you mean those two examples, like, for instance, Thupten Tsering La [Tib. &#xF50;&#xF74;&#xF56;&#xF0B;&#xF56;&#xF66;&#xF9F;&#xF53;&#xF0B;&#xF5A;&#xF7A;&#xF0B;&#xF62;&#xF72;&#xF44;&#xF0B;&#xF63;&#xF42;&#xF66;] and Panden La [Tib. &#xF51;&#xF54;&#xF63;&#xF0B;&#xF63;&#xFA1;&#xF53;&#xF0B;&#xF63;&#xF42;&#xF66;], they are the Ling Labrang [Tib. &#xF42;&#xFB3;&#xF72;&#xF44;&#xF0B;&#xF56;&#xFB3;&#xF0B;&#xF56;&#xFB2;&#xF44;] people.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  Ling Labrang is ... what do you mean?   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  This is the <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. &#xF56;&#xFB3;&#xF0B;&#xF56;&#xFB2;&#xF44;] 1. The property/wealth owning corporate entity of an incarnate lama. 2. The property/wealth owning corporate entity of the Panchen Lama.">labrang</span> of the tutor to the Dalai Lama, Yongdzin. So it was called Ling Labrang and Thubten Tsering is from Ling Labrang and Panden la is from Trijang [Tib. &#xF41;&#xFB2;&#xF72;&#xF0B;&#xF56;&#xFB1;&#xF44;] Labrang.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  So, assuming in a case like that these people would learn how to read and write and then they would try do this mibab janshu.   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  Yeah.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  So they would go straight through?   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  They would go straight through. Yes, these people would go straight through.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  So, its like a <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. &#xF64;&#xF42;&#xF0B;&#xF5A;&#xF44;] 1. The household or family of a monk that consisted of multiple monks. 2. The apartment of a monk household.">shagtsang</span>, in a sense?   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  Yes, almost a shagtsang.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  And their loyalty is probably always with the <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. &#xF56;&#xFB3;&#xF0B;&#xF56;&#xFB2;&#xF44;] 1. The property/wealth owning corporate entity of an incarnate lama. 2. The property/wealth owning corporate entity of the Panchen Lama.">labrang</span>?   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  More so. It is the <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. &#xF56;&#xFB3;&#xF0B;&#xF56;&#xFB2;&#xF44;] 1. The property/wealth owning corporate entity of an incarnate lama. 2. The property/wealth owning corporate entity of the Panchen Lama.">labrang</span>&apos;s responsibility. For instance, Panden La live there.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  They live in the <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. &#xF56;&#xFB3;&#xF0B;&#xF56;&#xFB2;&#xF44;] 1. The property/wealth owning corporate entity of an incarnate lama. 2. The property/wealth owning corporate entity of the Panchen Lama.">labrang</span>?   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  They live in the <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. &#xF56;&#xFB3;&#xF0B;&#xF56;&#xFB2;&#xF44;] 1. The property/wealth owning corporate entity of an incarnate lama. 2. The property/wealth owning corporate entity of the Panchen Lama.">labrang</span>. And then in the labrang also they have a very important position. Almost next to the chandz&#xF6;.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  And sometimes when you become a high post like a <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. &#xF51;&#xFB2;&#xF74;&#xF44;&#xF0B;&#xF61;&#xF72;&#xF42;&#xF0B;&#xF46;&#xF7A;&#xF53;&#xF0B;&#xF58;&#xF7C;] The title of the four heads of the Yigtsang Office (Ecclesiastics Office).">drunyichemmo</span>, you get thapten [Tib. &#xF50;&#xF56;&#xF0B;&#xF62;&#xF9F;&#xF7A;&#xF53;]. thapten means, like a salary estate or position?   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  Method.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  Method?   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  Method on which you can live on.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  So the example was?   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  The example is Lh&#xFC;ndup Dzong [Tib. &#xF63;&#xFB7;&#xF74;&#xF53;&#xF0B;&#xF42;&#xFB2;&#xF74;&#xF56;&#xF0B;&#xF62;&#xFAB;&#xF7C;&#xF44;]. When we had the trouble with Lh&#xFC;ndup Dzong it was <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. &#xF51;&#xFB2;&#xF74;&#xF44;&#xF0B;&#xF61;&#xF72;&#xF42;&#xF0B;&#xF46;&#xF7A;&#xF53;&#xF0B;&#xF58;&#xF7C;] The title of the four heads of the Yigtsang Office (Ecclesiastics Office).">drunyichemmo</span>&apos;s thapten.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  The <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. &#xF51;&#xFB2;&#xF74;&#xF44;&#xF0B;&#xF61;&#xF72;&#xF42;&#xF0B;&#xF46;&#xF7A;&#xF53;&#xF0B;&#xF58;&#xF7C;] The title of the four heads of the Yigtsang Office (Ecclesiastics Office).">drunyichemmo</span>, which one?   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  Bumdang [Tib. &#xF60;&#xF56;&#xF74;&#xF58;&#xF0B;&#xF50;&#xF44;].   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  Bumdang?   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  Yes, Bumdang. That was his thabten.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  O.K., that means   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  Maybe <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. &#xF51;&#xFB2;&#xF74;&#xF44;&#xF0B;&#xF61;&#xF72;&#xF42;&#xF0B;&#xF46;&#xF7A;&#xF53;&#xF0B;&#xF58;&#xF7C;] The title of the four heads of the Yigtsang Office (Ecclesiastics Office).">drunyichemmo</span>, they don&apos;t leave it. I think they take them with them. I don&apos;t think they return them. Although they are supposed to, I don&apos;t think they return them.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  Because then there is also <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. &#xF58;&#xF51;&#xF60;&#xF0B;&#xF51;&#xF54;&#xF7C;&#xF53;] A commander or general in charge of a regiment in the traditional Tibetan Army. If a regiment had only 500 troops, there was usually only one dep&#xF6;n, but if there were 1,000 troops, there were usually two.">dep&#xF6;n</span> had the estate called dashi [Tib. &#xF58;&#xF51;&#xF60;&#xF0B;&#xF42;&#xF5E;&#xF72;&#xF66;], right?   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  They don&apos;t return. And the kal&#xF6;n also had the same called kashi [Tib. &#xF56;&#xF40;&#xF60;&#xF0B;&#xF42;&#xF5E;&#xF72;&#xF66;].   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  They always bring them? Are you sure?   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  I remember <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. &#xF41;&#xFB2;&#xF72;&#xF0B;&#xF66;&#xFA8;&#xF7C;&#xF53;] The name of the aristocratic family of an important lay official .">Trim&#xF6;n</span> [Tib. &#xF41;&#xFB2;&#xF72;&#xF0B;&#xF66;&#xFA8;&#xF7C;&#xF53;] had so much debt at the end, and one of the children&apos;s big estate which was the kal&#xF6;n&apos;s thabten. Later Trim&#xF6;n gave it to K&#xFC;ndeling [Tib. &#xF40;&#xF74;&#xF53;&#xF0B;&#xF56;&#xF51;&#xF7A;&#xF0B;&#xF42;&#xFB3;&#xF72;&#xF44;] to settle his debt.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  So it&apos;s not quite sure whether they actually give back these thapten, so like   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  On the other hand, whenever they became the <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. &#xF62;&#xFAB;&#xF7C;&#xF44;] A district in the traditional Tibetan governmental structure. This large administrative unit was headed by one or two district heads (tib. dzongp&#xF6;n [&#xF62;&#xFAB;&#xF7C;&#xF44;&#xF0B;&#xF51;&#xF54;&#xF7C;&#xF53;]) appointed by the Tibetan government. Typically there was one lay official and one monk official who were jointly sent from Lhasa for three year terms. They were responsible for collecting taxes and adjudicating disputes in their district. These dzong were equivalent to counties (ch. &#x53BF;) in the current Chinese system of administration.">dzong</span> like that, and then later the it became the dzongshi shungzdin [Tib. &#xF62;&#xFAB;&#xF7C;&#xF44;&#xF0B;&#xF42;&#xF5E;&#xF72;&#xF66;&#xF0B;&#xF42;&#xF5E;&#xF74;&#xF44;&#xF0B;&#xF60;&#xF5B;&#xF72;&#xF53;]   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  Dzongshi Shungdzin?   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  Yes, you know, later, the <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. &#xF62;&#xFAB;&#xF7C;&#xF44;] A district in the traditional Tibetan governmental structure. This large administrative unit was headed by one or two district heads (tib. dzongp&#xF6;n [&#xF62;&#xFAB;&#xF7C;&#xF44;&#xF0B;&#xF51;&#xF54;&#xF7C;&#xF53;]) appointed by the Tibetan government. Typically there was one lay official and one monk official who were jointly sent from Lhasa for three year terms. They were responsible for collecting taxes and adjudicating disputes in their district. These dzong were equivalent to counties (ch. &#x53BF;) in the current Chinese system of administration.">dzong</span> and estates didn&apos;t belong to the individual and it was under the Legj&#xF6; and run by the government.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  Yeah, under the Legj&#xF6;.   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  Yes, not given to an individual, but all the income goes to the government.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  Not given to who?   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  To the individual. Whatever income they have goes to the government. They call it bumpa siblu [Tib. &#xF56;&#xF74;&#xF58;&#xF0B;&#xF54;&#xF0B;&#xF66;&#xF72;&#xF56;&#xF0B;&#xF56;&#xFB3;&#xF74;&#xF42;] . Whatever the income comes and goes into the government, whatever expenditures and also spent the same way, and the person who is responsible, they get part of it. So that was <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. &#xF62;&#xFAB;&#xF7C;&#xF44;&#xF0B;&#xF42;&#xF5E;&#xF72;&#xF66;] A government estate; an estate that belonged to a dzong (district).">dzongshi</span> shungdzin. And I think   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  So earlier they probably just kept it?   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  Kept it.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  O.k., let&apos;s go through some of the ... another way of coming into   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  Coming into the government official is through the Dalai Lama&apos;s kitchen, tse s&#xF6;lthab [Tib. &#xF62;&#xFA9;&#xF7A;&#xF0B;&#xF42;&#xF66;&#xF7C;&#xF63;&#xF0B;&#xF50;&#xF56;] and they become Dalai Lama&apos;s cook, s&#xF6;thabpa [Tib. &#xF42;&#xF66;&#xF7C;&#xF63;&#xF0B;&#xF50;&#xF56;&#xF0B;&#xF54;], they enjoy certain rank. Some young people, they come there. Then, from the s&#xF6;lthabpa, they get promoted. Sometimes they promote someone else.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  How do you spell s&#xF6;thabpa?   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  [Tib. &#xF42;&#xF66;&#xF7C;&#xF63;&#xF0B;&#xF50;&#xF56;&#xF0B;&#xF54;]. So, normally, from the s&#xF6;lthab, they are promoted to the position of two <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. &#xF51;&#xF54;&#xF7C;&#xF53;&#xF0B;&#xF54;&#xF7C;] 1. A lord. 2. A local chief.">p&#xF6;npo</span>; p&#xF6;npo drepa [Tib. &#xF51;&#xF54;&#xF7C;&#xF53;&#xF0B;&#xF54;&#xF7C;&#xF0B;&#xF56;&#xF42;&#xFB2;&#xF7A;&#xF66;&#xF0B;&#xF54;] [the senior in charge of preparing the food for the Dalai Lama] and p&#xF6;npo sh&#xF6;npa [Tib. &#xF51;&#xF54;&#xF7C;&#xF53;&#xF0B;&#xF54;&#xF7C;&#xF0B;&#xF42;&#xF5E;&#xF7C;&#xF53;&#xF0B;&#xF54;] [the junior in charge of preparing the food for the Dalai Lama]. Those normally should have been promoted. But in case of certain s&#xF6;lthabpa, they came out of the s&#xF6;ltabpa life and then goes into the official rank.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  Becomes a government official?   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  Government official. They, many of them become. And then another one is certain who have a lot of rewards, they have been powerful, something doing during the trouble period, becomes sort of powerful and then given a government rank. An example is Chamdo Khenjung Dawala [Tib. &#xF46;&#xF56;&#xF0B;&#xF58;&#xF51;&#xF7C;&#xF0B;&#xF58;&#xF41;&#xF53;&#xF0B;&#xF46;&#xF74;&#xF44;&#xF0B;&#xF5F;&#xFB3;&#xF0B;&#xF56;&#xF0B;&#xF63;&#xF42;&#xF66;]]. He was a <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. &#xF41;&#xF58;&#xF66;&#xF0B;&#xF54;] A person from the Kham region, a Tibetan from the Khamba (Khampa) sub-cultural group.">Khamba</span>, he was living always Chamdo. He has become ... he is for the Tibetan.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  In 1980?   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  In 1980. Chamdo Khenjung Dawala. He was there even later on.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  In 1950 he was in Kham?   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  He was in Kham. That was Chamdo Khenjung Dawala. These are the examples.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  Now, is it your ... what my recollection is that in the government, all requests and that first go to the Kashag? So the Kashag sends it to <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. &#xF61;&#xF72;&#xF42;&#xF0B;&#xF5A;&#xF44;] The highest office dealing with monastic and religious affairs in the traditional Tibetan government. It is often called the Ecclesiastic Office. It was headed by 4 fourth rank monk officials called Trunyichemmo. The senior Trunyichemmo was called Ta Lama.">Yigtsang</span>, or to <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. &#xF56;&#xFB3;&#xF0B;&#xF55;&#xFB1;&#xF42;] 1. The abbreviation of bla brang phyag mdzod, a major treasury/supply office that was located on the second floor of the Tsuglagang Temple and collected taxes annually from various parts of Tibet. 2. A monastic official/manager who worked for the Labrang of the abbots or incarnate lamas. For example, in Loseling College in Drepung, the Laja worked for the abbot who appointed him.">Laja</span> Office?   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  Even the cases?   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  Cases or requests from its own <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. &#xF62;&#xFAB;&#xF7C;&#xF44;] A district in the traditional Tibetan governmental structure. This large administrative unit was headed by one or two district heads (tib. dzongp&#xF6;n [&#xF62;&#xFAB;&#xF7C;&#xF44;&#xF0B;&#xF51;&#xF54;&#xF7C;&#xF53;]) appointed by the Tibetan government. Typically there was one lay official and one monk official who were jointly sent from Lhasa for three year terms.

<p><strong>A:</strong>  I don&apos;t think so. They can send to Kashag, they can send to Tsikhang.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  You think so?   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  Yes, for sure. And then if it is something to do with the monastery then they will definitely send to Yigtshang. I mean, in <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. &#xF62;&#xFAB;&#xF7C;&#xF44;] A district in the traditional Tibetan governmental structure. This large administrative unit was headed by one or two district heads (tib. dzongp&#xF6;n [&#xF62;&#xFAB;&#xF7C;&#xF44;&#xF0B;&#xF51;&#xF54;&#xF7C;&#xF53;]) appointed by the Tibetan government.

They were responsible for collecting taxes and adjudicating disputes in their district. These dzong were equivalent to counties (ch. &#x53BF;) in the current Chinese system of administration.">dzong</span>, in the dzong they had monastery troubles. Then that goes to the Yigtsang.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  No, I mean, <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. &#xF61;&#xF72;&#xF42;&#xF0B;&#xF5A;&#xF44;] The highest office dealing with monastic and religious affairs in the traditional Tibetan government. It is often called the Ecclesiastic Office. It was headed by 4 fourth rank monk officials called Trunyichemmo. The senior Trunyichemmo was called Ta Lama.">Yigtsang</span>, I know its that, but I&apos;m talking about in the government things. Requests about this or that, about information requests. I think it have to go to Kashag.   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  I doubt it. I really doubt it, because Tsikhang comes first. Some may even go to the Laja.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  I&apos;ll have to find out. Talking about now Drepung, that, so we&apos;re talking then about in Drepung which monks are in which khamtsen. Kongpo Khamtsen has monks from Konpo and has monks from nearby Lhasa, and has some of the people from some different regions, some people from Shotar Lhosum [Tib. &#xF64;&#xF7C;&#xF0B;&#xF66;&#xF9F;&#xF62;&#xF0B;&#xF63;&#xFB7;&#xF7C;&#xF0B;&#xF42;&#xF66;&#xF74;&#xF58;] also, but not everybody.   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  Not everybody.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  I&apos;m not sure how it goes.   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  Well, nearby Lhasa also not everybody.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  And it has the status of a big <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. &#xF41;&#xF44;&#xF0B;&#xF5A;&#xF53;] A monastic residential unit in which monks from specific geographic areas lived. These were corporate entities with property and internal officials. Some large khamtsen had smaller subordinate units called mi tshan. Khamtsen were part of tratsang (colleges). For example, Hamdong Khamtsen was part of Gomang College in Drepung Monastery.">khamtsen</span>, but not necessarily that many people?   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  Not very many people, yes.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  Then what about Tsa Khamtsen [Tib. &#xF5A;&#xF0B;&#xF56;]?   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  Tsha is mostly monks from J&#xFC; [Tib. &#xF60;&#xF47;&#xF74;] area in Kham.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  Kham J&#xFC;? I&apos;ve never even heard of J&#xFC;.   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  This is place from where Juchen Thubten [Tib. &#xF60;&#xF47;&#xF74;&#xF0B;&#xF46;&#xF7A;&#xF53;&#xF0B;&#xF50;&#xF74;&#xF56;&#xF0B;&#xF56;&#xF66;&#xF9F;&#xF53;] came.   </p>

<p><strong>Q:</strong>  So J&#xFC; is an area near Dege?   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  Near Dege some where. And there is a mountain called Tsha Karpo [Tib. &#xF5A;&#xF0B;&#xF56;&#xF0B;&#xF51;&#xF40;&#xF62;&#xF0B;&#xF54;&#xF7C;].   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  And J&#xFC; is spelled what?   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  [Tib. &#xF60;&#xF47;&#xF74;]   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  So mostly from there?   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  There, and also from Pagsh&#xF6; [Tib. &#xF51;&#xF54;&#xF60;&#xF0B;&#xF64;&#xF7C;&#xF51;] I think.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  And Phukhang?   </p>

<p><strong>Q:</strong>  I heard also that Ba Lithang [Tib. &#xF60;&#xF56;&#xF60;&#xF0B;&#xF63;&#xF72;&#xF0B;&#xF50;&#xF44;] in there?   </p>

<p><strong>Q:</strong>  No?   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  Litang goes to Pompora [Tib. &#xF66;&#xFA4;&#xF7C;&#xF58;&#xF0B;&#xF54;&#xF7C;&#xF0B;&#xF62;] and Kongtserawa goes to Phukhang.   </p>

<p><strong>Q:</strong>  And Chamdo?   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  Chamdo goes to Lhopa [Tib. &#xF63;&#xFB7;&#xF7C;&#xF0B;&#xF54;].   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  Like, what other is there like Khyungpo [Tib. &#xF41;&#xFB1;&#xF74;&#xF44;&#xF0B;&#xF54;&#xF7C;]?   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  I am not sure.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  Let&apos;s see, what other regions are there in Markham [Tib. &#xF66;&#xFA8;&#xF62;&#xF0B;&#xF41;&#xF58;&#xF66;]?   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  Some of them goes to Phara and some of them goes to Phukhang also. Now, the teacher on the Dialectics School, Tsenyi Lobdra [Tib. &#xF58;&#xF5A;&#xF53;&#xF0B;&#xF49;&#xF72;&#xF51;&#xF0B;&#xF66;&#xFB3;&#xF7C;&#xF56;&#xF0B;&#xF42;&#xFB2;&#xFAD;] probably is from Markham [Tib. &#xF66;&#xFA8;&#xF62;&#xF0B;&#xF41;&#xF58;&#xF66;].   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  What about Gyethang [Tib. &#xF62;&#xF92;&#xFB1;&#xF63;&#xF0B;&#xF50;&#xF44;]?   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  Gyethang is Pombora.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  So where do the Mongolians, sogpo go?   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  They go to Gomang.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  And Amdos?   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  There are all different kinds of Amdo. Most of them are <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. &#xF66;&#xF92;&#xF7C;&#xF0B;&#xF58;&#xF44;] One of the large colleges in Drepung Monastery.">Gomang</span> and few of them are Loseling.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  So <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. &#xF56;&#xFB3;&#xF7C;&#xF0B;&#xF42;&#xF66;&#xF63;&#xF0B;&#xF42;&#xFB3;&#xF72;&#xF44;] One of the main colleges in Drepung Monastery.">Loseling</span> then is what, mostly   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  And then there are also some other belonged to Tsha. There are two <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. &#xF58;&#xF72;&#xF0B;&#xF5A;&#xF53;] A sub-unit of a khamtsen.">mitsen</span> in Tsha; &#xDC;t&#xF6; [Tib. &#xF51;&#xF56;&#xF74;&#xF0B;&#xF66;&#xF9F;&#xF7C;&#xF51;] and Tsomai [Tib. &#xF58;&#xF5A;&#xF7C;&#xF0B;&#xF66;&#xFA8;&#xF51;&#xF0B;&#xF68;&#xF7C;&#xF62;&#xF0B;&#xF60;&#xF5A;&#xF7C;&#xF0B;&#xF66;&#xFA8;&#xF51;&#xF84;] both located in the T&#xF6;lung [Tib. &#xF66;&#xF9F;&#xF7C;&#xF51;&#xF0B;&#xF63;&#xF74;&#xF44;]   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  O.K. then. Let me get this now. So Tsa has two <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. &#xF58;&#xF72;&#xF0B;&#xF5A;&#xF53;] A sub-unit of a khamtsen.">mitsen</span>?   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  Yes, the near by, nyekora and long distance, thagringa.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  How do you spell?   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  The near by, nyekora [Tib. &#xF49;&#xF7A;&#xF0B;&#xF60;&#xF41;&#xF7C;&#xF62;&#xF0B;&#xF56;] and long distance, thagringa [Tib. &#xF50;&#xF42;&#xF0B;&#xF62;&#xF72;&#xF44;&#xF0B;&#xF56;] They were Khambas.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  So when you say that <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. &#xF5A;&#xF0B;&#xF56;&#xF0B;&#xF41;&#xF44;&#xF0B;&#xF5A;&#xF53;] One of the main residential units (khamtsen) in Drepung Monastery.">Tsha Khamtsen</span> has two <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. &#xF58;&#xF72;&#xF0B;&#xF5A;&#xF53;] A sub-unit of a khamtsen.">mitsen</span>, that means that of all of the monks, a lot of the monks are just in Tsha Khamtsen, but then there were also two mitsen?   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  Yes. But all the Tsha are not included in the mitsen.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  Just some of them are?   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  Just &#xDC;t&#xF6; and Tshomai.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  So what difference does it make if you&apos;re in a <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. &#xF58;&#xF72;&#xF0B;&#xF5A;&#xF53;] A sub-unit of a khamtsen.">mitsen</span>?   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  No difference.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  No difference?   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  Sometimes the <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. &#xF58;&#xF72;&#xF0B;&#xF5A;&#xF53;] A sub-unit of a khamtsen.">mitsen</span> has separate meetings, separate distributions that you can benefit from. But then these two mitsen; &#xDC;t&#xF6; and Tshomai, they are eligible to be shengo. And <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. &#xF5A;&#xF0B;&#xF56;&#xF0B;&#xF41;&#xF44;&#xF0B;&#xF5A;&#xF53;] One of the main residential units (khamtsen) in Drepung Monastery.">Tsha Khamtsen</span> is not eligible to be shengo.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  Oh really?   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  Yes, only two of them are eligible to be shengo.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  So <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. &#xF66;&#xFA1;&#xF7A;&#xF0B;&#xF61;&#xF44;&#xF66;] One of the colleges in Drepung Monastery.">Deyang</span> [Tib. &#xF66;&#xFA1;&#xF7A;&#xF0B;&#xF61;&#xF44;&#xF66;] and Ngagpa [Tib. &#xF66;&#xF94;&#xF42;&#xF66;&#xF0B;&#xF54;].   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. &#xF66;&#xFA1;&#xF7A;&#xF0B;&#xF61;&#xF44;&#xF66;] One of the colleges in Drepung Monastery.">Deyang</span> and Ngagpa are very small. But their monks are now mostly from nearby. So they don&apos;t really have anybody come from a distance.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  And Treu <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. &#xF41;&#xF58;&#xF66;&#xF0B;&#xF54;] A person from the Kham region, a Tibetan from the Khamba (Khampa) sub-cultural group.">Khamba</span> [Tib. &#xF4F;&#xFB2;&#xF7A;&#xF0B;&#xF67;&#xF7C;&#xF62;&#xF0B;&#xF41;&#xF58;&#xF66;&#xF0B;&#xF54;], where are they from?   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  They are from Ganzi [Tib. &#xF51;&#xF40;&#xF62;&#xF0B;&#xF58;&#xF5B;&#xF7A;&#xF66;] and Drango [Tib. &#xF56;&#xFB2;&#xF42;&#xF0B;&#xF60;&#xF42;&#xF7C;] and Dargye [Tib. &#xF51;&#xF62;&#xF0B;&#xF62;&#xF92;&#xFB1;&#xF66;] are all goes to Treu Khamtsen.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  And Golog [Tib. &#xF58;&#xF42;&#xF74;&#xF0B;&#xF63;&#xF7C;&#xF42;]?   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  Some of them goes to Rongpo [Tib. &#xF62;&#xF7C;&#xF44;&#xF0B;&#xF54;&#xF7C;].   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  Rongbo is another one?   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  Yes.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  That&apos;s a small one?   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  Small one, but there were also <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. &#xF68;&#xF0B;&#xF58;&#xF51;&#xF7C;] One of the three main Tibetan sub-ethnic areas. It is located in the northeast of the Tibetan Plateau mostly in today&apos;s Qinghai Province. A person from Amdo is called an Amdowa.">Amdo</span> in there and also Gulog. I heard that some Amdo comes to Loseling.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  O.K, now this is all automatic? If you come and you want to join <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. &#xF56;&#xFB3;&#xF7C;&#xF0B;&#xF42;&#xF66;&#xF63;&#xF0B;&#xF42;&#xFB3;&#xF72;&#xF44;] One of the main colleges in Drepung Monastery.">Loseling</span>, which <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. &#xF41;&#xF44;&#xF0B;&#xF5A;&#xF53;] A monastic residential unit in which monks from specific geographic areas lived.

<p><strong>A:</strong>  Automatic.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  You have no authority?   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  In my case a lot of trouble came up.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  Why?   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  Because I, being the son of Demo [Tib. &#xF51;&#xF7A;&#xF0B;&#xF58;&#xF7C;] Rimpoche, the Kongpo Khamtsen demanded that I go in their khamtsen. And my previous reincarnation was Nyare.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  Nyare is spelled what?   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  Nyare [Tib. &#xF49;&#xF42;&#xF0B;&#xF62;&#xF7A;]. So it was obvious that I should go to Nyare. So they had trouble, and I think then they chose to call me Nyare Khentr&#xFC; [Tib. &#xF49;&#xF42;&#xF0B;&#xF62;&#xF7A;&#xF0B;&#xF58;&#xF41;&#xF53;&#xF0B;&#xF66;&#xFA4;&#xFB2;&#xF74;&#xF63;] by Nyare Khamtsen.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  I see. That was a new thing?   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  It was a new thing.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  So you were actually in Nyare?   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  In Nyare, and I don&apos;t want to shift.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  So you were physically where?   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  Nyare.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  In Nyare?   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  Yes.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  So would you say you joined Kongpo Khamtsen, what does that mean?   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  That means you can also list your name in Kongpo too.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  So you can do that, or was that special?   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  You can&apos;t do that.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  They just made a special case?   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  Special case. Although Demo Rimpoche came to join Drepung, and he joined Sera. And in then in Ganden. He joined all the three monasteries. Big Lamas are like that. Like Traya [Tib. &#xF56;&#xFB2;&#xF42;&#xF0B;&#xF42;&#xF61;&#xF56;] Rimpoche, he had to join in Drepung as a Nyare, he had to join Rat&#xF6; [Tib. &#xF62;&#xF0B;&#xF66;&#xF9F;&#xF7C;&#xF51;] as a Nyare, he had to joined Ganden as a Nyare. And I think he doesn&apos;t join Sera. Mostly come from Traya. All the Traya monks go to Nyare.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  Nyare goes to Traya.   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  Traya goes to Nyare. And the Gonjo [Tib. &#xF42;&#xF7C;&#xF0B;&#xF60;&#xF47;&#xF7C;] too. Not much, I don&apos;t think there is much from Markham comes in Nyare.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  So what would the percent be, do you think, of the monks in Drepung, what would the percent be of Khambas versus &#xDC;tsangpa [Tib. &#xF51;&#xF56;&#xF74;&#xF66;&#xF0B;&#xF42;&#xF59;&#xF44;&#xF0B;&#xF54;]? Say 80 percent?   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  In the case of <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. &#xF56;&#xFB3;&#xF7C;&#xF0B;&#xF42;&#xF66;&#xF63;&#xF0B;&#xF42;&#xFB3;&#xF72;&#xF44;] One of the main colleges in Drepung Monastery.">Loseling</span>, I really think it is about, if not 70, then 60 percent is Khambas.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  60 to 70 percent?   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  60 to 70 percent.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  And the rest would be &#xDC;tsangpa, or Amdos   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  Um, Amdos are not the rest. Mostly <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. &#xF51;&#xF56;&#xF74;&#xF66;&#xF0B;&#xF42;&#xF59;&#xF44;] The two major sections of Central Tibet: &#xDC; and Tsang.

<p><strong>A:</strong>  His own gegen.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  I see.   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  Now ... there is a very interesting case now. Below <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. &#xF42;&#xF49;&#xF7A;&#xF62;&#xF0B;&#xF54;] A steward or manager. In some monasteries, the nyerba was in charge of storerooms under the authority of a higher manager called a chandz&#xF6;.">nyerba</span>, junior ... every year four monks will go, in the case of Nyare Khamtsen, every year four monks will be transferred from the sh&#xF6;ndre.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  Sh&#xF6;ndre is what?   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  Sh&#xF6;ndre is the junior monks who are not exempt from the monastery tax. So they are not exempted. Every year four monks will be, seniority-wise, exempted from the work obligation as a junior monk. Out of four, by lottery, two will become <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. &#xF42;&#xF49;&#xF7A;&#xF62;&#xF0B;&#xF54;] A steward or manager.

<p><strong>Q:</strong>  I see. They are just exempted.   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  Yes, four names they will roll it.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  So.   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  Now these four - whoever is going to be exempted for - the <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. &#xF42;&#xF49;&#xF7A;&#xF62;&#xF0B;&#xF54;] A steward or manager. In some monasteries, the nyerba was in charge of storerooms under the authority of a higher manager called a chandz&#xF6;.">nyerba</span> have a lot of expenditures also. Personally they have a lot of expenditures. So in order to meet that, in the case of Nyare Khamtsen we have the chapel called Dr&#xF6;lma Lhakhang [Tib. &#xF66;&#xF92;&#xFB2;&#xF7C;&#xF63;&#xF0B;&#xF58;&#xF0B;&#xF63;&#xFB7;&#xF0B;&#xF41;&#xF44;] in <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. &#xF47;&#xF7C;&#xF0B;&#xF41;&#xF44;] A most famous temple in Lhasa that houses a holy statue of the Buddha.

For example, Hamdong Khamtsen was part of Gomang College in Drepung Monastery.">khamtsen</span>, they make these four monks ... they allow these four monks to collect.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  So like   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  They allow these four monks to go.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  To use that income?   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  To use that income.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  From Dr&#xF6;lma Lhakhang?   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  Yes, from Dr&#xF6;lma Lhakhang. They go there and sit four months for each.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  Three months?   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  Yeah, three months each. So three months each, and during the three months whatever income you got is your personal income. Whichever, anybody who offers anything to Dr&#xF6;lma, you know, the Lhasa seniors they give money, they throw money and offerings, all this will go to the monks there. It&apos;s yours to keep.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  I see. And that&apos;s just the way it is?   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  That&apos;s ... every year they go and change. Every three months they go and change.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  And these are under the <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. &#xF42;&#xF49;&#xF7A;&#xF62;&#xF0B;&#xF54;] A steward or manager. In some monasteries, the nyerba was in charge of storerooms under the authority of a higher manager called a chandz&#xF6;.">nyerba</span>?   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  These ... these four monks who are keeping the Dr&#xF6;lma Lhakhang this year will be rolled their names. And two will become <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. &#xF42;&#xF49;&#xF7A;&#xF62;&#xF0B;&#xF54;] A steward or manager.

<p><strong>Q:</strong>  But they still go and get their money?   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  They still go and get their income. That&apos;s good luck for them.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  So who appoints the <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. &#xF42;&#xF49;&#xF7A;&#xF62;&#xF0B;&#xF54;] A steward or manager. In some monasteries, the nyerba was in charge of storerooms under the authority of a higher manager called a chandz&#xF6;.">nyerba</span>?   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  They roll their names, four names.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  No, but this is after the fact. The <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. &#xF42;&#xF49;&#xF7A;&#xF62;&#xF0B;&#xF54;] A steward or manager.

<p><strong>A:</strong>  Yes.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  So how does the <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. &#xF42;&#xF49;&#xF7A;&#xF62;&#xF0B;&#xF54;] A steward or manager. In some monasteries, the nyerba was in charge of storerooms under the authority of a higher manager called a chandz&#xF6;.">nyerba</span> get picked?   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  You see, that&apos;s what I mean. Every year four monks exempted from the junior work obligations.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  Oh, I see.   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  When they are examining that year, they get the Dr&#xF6;lma Lhakhang, they roll their names, and two become <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. &#xF42;&#xF49;&#xF7A;&#xF62;&#xF0B;&#xF54;] A steward or manager.

Now between the nyerba and the <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. &#xF41;&#xF44;&#xF0B;&#xF5A;&#xF53;&#xF0B;&#xF51;&#xF42;&#xF7A;&#xF0B;&#xF62;&#xF92;&#xF53;] The head official of a khamtsen.">khamtsen gegen</span>, every year there is one monk who becomes a khamtsen gegen, in between that period there is a <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. &#xF42;&#xF5E;&#xF7C;&#xF53;&#xF0B;&#xF41;&#xFB2;&#xF63;] The work obligations all young monks have to do for the monastery (it literally means &quot;youth tax&quot;).">sh&#xF6;ndre</span> gemba [Tib. &#xF62;&#xF92;&#xF53;&#xF0B;&#xF54;] which is the senior sh&#xF6;ndre or junior tsondu.

<p><strong>Q:</strong>  Ok, let&apos;s then hold up a second. [What about the] <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. &#xF42;&#xFB2;&#xFAD;&#xF0B;&#xF5A;&#xF44;] A &quot;college&quot; within a monastery, for example, in Drepung Monastery there were four main tratsang: Gomang, Loseling, Deyang and Ngagpa.

<p><strong>Q:</strong>  Who assisted him, they would be under him?   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  Under him.

<p><strong>A:</strong>  I think. It should be.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  I&apos;m assuming they are under him. We didn&apos;t go into it entirely. Then there is the three uch&#xF6;?   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  Officially I think the uch&#xF6; are above the <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. &#xF55;&#xFB1;&#xF42;&#xF0B;&#xF66;&#xFA6;&#xF74;&#xF42;] A manager (of estates and endowments) of a monastic college or monastic khamtsen.">chabu</span> and bungdz&#xF6;.

In monastic settings it also refers to an adult monk who acted as a guardian to a younger monk. In such cases, the younger monk typically lived in the gegen&apos;s apartment (shag). In monasteries, however, it could also mean a real teacher, or the monk who served as the guarantor for a new monk.">gegen</span>, and lama shunglenba [Tib. &#xF56;&#xFB3;&#xF0B;&#xF58;&#xF0B;&#xF42;&#xF5E;&#xF74;&#xF44;&#xF0B;&#xF63;&#xF7A;&#xF53;&#xF0B;&#xF54;].

<p><strong>Q:</strong>  And this is a new post?   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  A new post. I think it was created only after when the Dalai Lama started appointing the bungdz&#xF6;.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  Right, right. 1920-1921.   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  After that then the Tibetan government started appointing <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. &#xF55;&#xFB1;&#xF42;&#xF0B;&#xF66;&#xFA6;&#xF74;&#xF42;] A manager (of estates and endowments) of a monastic college or monastic khamtsen.">chabu</span> so that the governments interests would be safe.

<p><strong>Q:</strong>  But they had to give them space, to look after them.   </p>

<p><strong>Q:</strong>  So the monastery had to give them   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  The monastery didn&apos;t give out of chabu. Whatever they could give was new thereafter. I think they did it instead of giving to the chabu. And the top level remained Phara Khempo period.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  Where does he come from?   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  He came from <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. &#xF66;&#xFA1;&#xF7A;&#xF0B;&#xF56;&#xF0B;&#xF42;&#xF5E;&#xF74;&#xF44;] The name of the traditional Tibetan government.">dewashung</span>, I don&apos;t know where he comes from.   </p>

So what happened is as soon as the khempo appointed a geg&#xF6;, they would come and the new khempo would start appointing, and other than for about two or three years they all would have been appointed by the khempo before.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  And then ... then there are you said, and lama k&#xF6;nyer.   </p>

<p><strong>A:</strong>  Khempo has over all in charge. Over all in charge on , examinations, demotions, promotions, and seeing that ... keeping everything at optimum. You know, the monks, from junior to senior, there are a lot of things. Like tshoglang [Tib. &#xF5A;&#xF7C;&#xF42;&#xF66;&#xF0B;&#xF63;&#xF44;]. Tshoglang means eliminated sort of examinations. There are different tshoglang every on every subject. So, like, for instance, pharchin [Tib. &#xF55;&#xF62;&#xF0B;&#xF55;&#xFB1;&#xF72;&#xF53;] takes 3 years, d&#xFC;wa [Tib. &#xF60;&#xF51;&#xF74;&#xF63;&#xF0B;&#xF56;] takes 4 years and uma [Tib. &#xF51;&#xF56;&#xF74;&#xF0B;&#xF58;] takes 2 years.

<p><strong>Q:</strong>  So, basically then, the people from the big <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. &#xF41;&#xF44;&#xF0B;&#xF5A;&#xF53;] A monastic residential unit in which monks from specific geographic areas lived. These were corporate entities with property and internal officials. Some large khamtsen had smaller subordinate units called mi tshan. Khamtsen were part of tratsang (colleges).

<p><strong>A:</strong>  Yes.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  And you interact with them?   </p>

<p><strong>Q:</strong>  So the big <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. &#xF41;&#xF44;&#xF0B;&#xF5A;&#xF53;] A monastic residential unit in which monks from specific geographic areas lived. These were corporate entities with property and internal officials. Some large khamtsen had smaller subordinate units called mi tshan. Khamtsen were part of tratsang (colleges).

<p><strong>A:</strong>  Khamtsen have more influence. And then there are 23 <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. &#xF41;&#xF44;&#xF0B;&#xF5A;&#xF53;] A monastic residential unit in which monks from specific geographic areas lived.

<p><strong>Q:</strong>  So if you think of it in terms of power, since <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. &#xF66;&#xF92;&#xF7C;&#xF0B;&#xF58;&#xF44;] One of the large colleges in Drepung Monastery.">Gomang</span> and <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. &#xF56;&#xFB3;&#xF7C;&#xF0B;&#xF42;&#xF66;&#xF63;&#xF0B;&#xF42;&#xFB3;&#xF72;&#xF44;] One of the main colleges in Drepung Monastery.">Loseling</span> are mostly like   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  Equal.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  People from far away, the wages, subsistence, are in the hands of the of the thagringa And they are the real power-houses, they have the money.   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  But when government matters come up, then the representatives choose one <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. &#xF55;&#xFB1;&#xF42;&#xF0B;&#xF66;&#xFA6;&#xF74;&#xF42;] A manager (of estates and endowments) of a monastic college or monastic khamtsen.">chabu</span>, and chabu will go. And whatever happened, I don&apos;t think the monks bothered. Unless it was objecting to his own <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. &#xF42;&#xFB2;&#xFAD;&#xF0B;&#xF5A;&#xF44;] A &quot;college&quot; within a monastery, for example, in Drepung Monastery there were four main tratsang: Gomang, Loseling, Deyang and Ngagpa. These tratsang were property owning corporate entities and included monks who were organized into residential dormitories called Khamtsen.">tratsang</span> or khamtsen. Until then, they don&apos;t even bother with what happened. When issues like the Reting case, it is a different matter. When it&apos;s Tengyeling case. When it is affecting to you, then they will go all-out. Exercise their influence, power, and monks living there ... And the <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. &#xF58;&#xF41;&#xF53;&#xF0B;&#xF54;&#xF7C;] The abbot of a monastery or monastic college.">khempo</span> has to act almost like a defender. Otherwise the khempo will get in trouble. Like in Sera Je. And if the khempo refuses to act according to the tratsang he could be killed.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  Now what about the tr&#xFC;paiku [Tib. &#xF66;&#xFA4;&#xFB2;&#xF74;&#xF63;&#xF0B;&#xF54;&#xF60;&#xF72;&#xF0B;&#xF66;&#xF90;&#xF74;] [the reincarnated lamas]?

And tr&#xFC;paiku will also see to it that they get strong support from khamtsen and tratsang, and khamtsen and tratsang will see to it ... according to the level of the tr&#xFC;paiku, he really will be protected very strongly. I forgot to mention one thing about khamtsen. I mentioned to you that khamtsen has business. Not only does khamtsen have business, there is something more than that. They also protect your almost sponsor, Jindag [Tib. &#xF66;&#xFA6;&#xFB1;&#xF72;&#xF53;&#xF0B;&#xF56;&#xF51;&#xF42;] dependent lay people who belong to your, sort of, side, or an ex-monk who tries to do business, or a big family who is part of the khamtsen ... part of the khamtsen in the sense of wherever the <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. &#xF42;&#xFB2;&#xFAD;&#xF0B;&#xF62;&#xF92;&#xFB1;&#xF74;&#xF53;] Monks who came to Drepung, Ganden and Sera from far distances such as Kham and Amdo.">tragy&#xFC;n</span> comes from, and wherever that area is the khamtsen will look to them as their own.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  That&apos;s why they give them <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. &#xF42;&#xF4F;&#xF7C;&#xF44;&#xF0B;&#xF66;&#xF92;&#xF7C;] A monastic obligation to provide the food and other necessary items served at a monastic prayer assembly meeting or some other rite; this was often a required obligation for monastic officials at the end of their term of office.">tonggo</span>?   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  Yes, they will. Originally, that&apos;s why. Like that.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  They have their own ?   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  They have their own sort of interests.

<p><strong>Q:</strong>  Well, what do you mean by they are not doing?   </p>

And according to the monks these business people will also remain indebted to you. They make a lot of offerings and distribution. That&apos;s how the relation is built in-between.   </p>

<p><strong>A:</strong>  Yes, they are sent from Drepung for the M&#xF6;nlam.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  Let&apos;s finish the small laji.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  What about the ex-nangma and ex-shengo?   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  There was no ex-nangma and ex-shengo. The only one who has the ex is the khempo.

<p><strong>Q:</strong>  If they come back to the monastery, right?   </p>

And there are also the rigji.   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  Rigji have 6 abbots, right?   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  What they come from?   </p>
