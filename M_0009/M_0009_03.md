**Q:**  This is a continuation of the tape on Depung monastery by Gelek Rimpoche on Septermber 5th 1985. The question is (when getting alms at a prayer assembly session) who goes around and gets extra <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. འགྱེ] Alms given to monks.">gye</a> (alms)?   

**A:**  That mostly is the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཞལ་ངོ] 1. a junior officer in the traditional Tibetan Army in charge of a unit of 25 soldiers (same as dingpön). 2. the two head disciplinary officials for all of Drepung monastery and for the Mönlam Prayer Festival.">sheyngo</a> and the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. དགེ་སྐོས] The main disciplinary official in a monastic college (tratsang).">gegö</a> in the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. གྲྭ་ཚང] A &quot;college&quot; within a monastery, for example, in Drepung Monastery there were four main tratsang: Gomang, Loseling, Deyang and Ngagpa. These tratsang were property owning corporate entities and included monks who were organized into residential dormitories called Khamtsen.">tratsang</a> and the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ནང་མ] A minor monk assistant to the Shengo at the Mönlam Chemmo Prayer Festival. These nangma ranked below the Chagdampa.">nangma</a> [Tib. ནང་མ] <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཆབ་རིལ] The Chabril&#x27;s main work was overseeing serving the traja. He was also the servant of the gegö and khempo. It had a middle status of the types of lene. The chabril was also the one responsible for beating the gong at the tsog and chöra. The chabril got an extra share of gye in the tratsang.">chabril</a> in the tratsang and the chagdampa [Tib. ཕྱག་དམ་པ] at the Mönlam. The chösungwa [Tib. ཆོས་སྲུང་བ] also goes. The shanggo shingnyer [Tib. ཞང་གོ་ཤིང་གཉེར] in the Mönlam Festival also goes in addition to that.   

**Q:**  Then in Mönlam, there were specials officials like the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. དགེ་གཡོག] Monk assistant to the disciplinary official (gegö) in monasteries.">geyog</a> and those stuffs. That kind of control all over Drepung or just <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. བློ་གསལ་གླིང] One of the main colleges in Drepung Monastery.">Loseling</a> and <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. སྒོ་མང] One of the large colleges in Drepung Monastery.">Gomang</a> [Tib. སྒོ་མང]?   

**A:**  For <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. བློ་གསལ་གླིང] One of the main colleges in Drepung Monastery.">Loseling</a>, all of them would go and sometimes, Loseling and Ngagpa [Tib. སྔགས་པ] would be the sheyngo. In the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. གྲྭ་ཚང] A &quot;college&quot; within a monastery, for example, in Drepung Monastery there were four main tratsang: Gomang, Loseling, Deyang and Ngagpa. These tratsang were property owning corporate entities and included monks who were organized into residential dormitories called Khamtsen.">tratsang</a>, <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. བླ་མ་གཞུང་ལེན་པ] A sort of deputy abbot who was in charge of the scholastic monks (the pechewa).">lama shunglenpa</a> [Tib. བླ་མ་གཞུང་ལེན་པ] doesn't really have much income except those officially in the tratsang, they get only 2 shares. So does the umdze. The <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. དགེ་སྐོས] The main disciplinary official in a monastic college (tratsang).">gegö</a> get a little more and they would say, "give me the reply" [Tib. ལན་ཁྱེར་ཤོག་ཨ].   

**Q:**  What does that mean?   

**A:**  That means if you are involved or make mistakes, you have to tell the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. དགེ་སྐོས] The main disciplinary official in a monastic college (tratsang).">gegö</a>. The gegö get a lot of money out of that. Any case that comes according to the discipline in the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. གྲྭ་ཚང] A &quot;college&quot; within a monastery, for example, in Drepung Monastery there were four main tratsang: Gomang, Loseling, Deyang and Ngagpa. These tratsang were property owning corporate entities and included monks who were organized into residential dormitories called Khamtsen.">tratsang</a>, it goes to the gegö and in the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཚོགས་ཆེན] The main assembly hall of a monastery. The assembly hall for the monastery as a whole.">tsogchen</a> it goes to sheyngo. They get a lot of money out of them. They also get a lot of money from the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. མཁན་པོ] Abbot of a monastery or monastic college.">khembo</a>   

**Q:**  How do people become officials? What is the process?   

**A:**  The process is normally, the monks who have a certain degree on the religious they don't become officials. They were categorized to become <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. དགེ་ཤེས] An advanced degree earned by scholar monks.">geshe</a> and abbot of the tratsang.   

**Q:**  The abbots always comes from the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. དགེ་ཤེས] An advanced degree earned by scholar monks.">geshe</a>?   

**A:**  Yes because the abbot is responsible for the monk's study also. The abbots don't become official at all.   

**Q:**  The abbots don't have involved?   

**A:**  The abbots don't get involved at all. Some of the monks were called dönsang [Tib. འདོན་བཟང] or kesang [Tib. སྐད་བཟང]. Those were the monks who have a good voice and they were socialized in chanting and they were performing the rituals and the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. དཔེ་ཆ་བ] A monk studying the monastic philosophical curriculum. A scholar monk.">pechawa</a> memorize the scriptures. Now, another group of monks would neither do the pechawa nor do the dönsang and sometimes they would go little bit here and there and also they know how to read and write. They also knew how to deal with the officials in Lhasa some sort of connections here and there through blood relation or through friends or any thing. They were little bit good at calculation and they have a little bit good relations and little bit of political strategy and little bit business mind. There was a group of them and they become officials and depends on the individual. Some how they were involved in any of the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. གྲྭ་ཚང] A &quot;college&quot; within a monastery, for example, in Drepung Monastery there were four main tratsang: Gomang, Loseling, Deyang and Ngagpa. These tratsang were property owning corporate entities and included monks who were organized into residential dormitories called Khamtsen.">tratsang</a>'s estate as a depa [Tib. སྡེ་པ] [shidü] and then they become little bigger, they sort of   

**Q:**  How do they have to ask for the position?   

**A:**  All of the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཕྱག་མཛོད] A senior manager/treasurer of an aristocratic or monastic estate, or the senior manager/treasurer of an aristocratic family or a monastic unit. Generally chandzö handled both internal and external issues and were considered higher in power and status than nyerpa (stewards), who typically only handled the storerooms.">chandzö</a> would decide and some of them had the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཕྱག་སྦུག] A manager (of estates and endowments) of a monastic college or monastic khamtsen.">chabu</a> or the chandzö who were their friends and they would decide. I don't believe that sort of they really applied for that. The chabu just asked them to do that. And sometimes, the abbot asked them to do that. The <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. སྦུག་མཛོད] A manager/steward who was in charge of the estates of a monastery or monastic college.">bungdzö</a> [Tib. སྦུག་མཛོད] and the chabu also were led by the abbot and those people would make the decision. Then when they become little more permanent, then it is possible that they they may go into the chabu list and become chabu. The chabu's term is life time. The bungdzö are also done by turn. The bungdzö are also sometimes done by geshes. Some of the small <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཁང་ཚན] A monastic residential unit in which monks from specific geographic areas lived. These were corporate entities with property and internal officials. Some large khamtsen had smaller subordinate units called mi tshan. Khamtsen were part of tratsang (colleges). For example, Hamdong Khamtsen was part of Gomang College in Drepung Monastery.">khamtsen</a> are short of people. So when they came to the turn of bungdzö, they ask the people in other khamtsen to be the bungdzö. Phara Khamtsen also had one bungdzö and one <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. བླ་བྲང] 1. The property/wealth owning corporate entity of an incarnate lama. 2. The property/wealth owning corporate entity of the Panchen Lama.">labrang</a> chandzö [Tib. བླ་བྲང་ཕྱག་མཛོད] and they were belonged to Phara Khamtsen. There was one doing the Phara Nyertsang [Tib. གཉེར་ཚང] pluss one Phara Bungdzö who was almost to become a geshe. that is more and less the line of Bungdzö. As for the chabu has to be permanent and well accepted and knows writing and reading which is more important, but their reading and writing is poor and especially their writing is very poor. Among the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. དཔེ་ཆ་བ] A monk studying the monastic philosophical curriculum. A scholar monk.">pechawa</a>, they didn't have problem on reading, but they don't become chabu. Even during when they show how they look, mibab janshu [Tib. མི་བབ་སྤྱན་ཞུ], to test them properly, [in front] of the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. དྲུང་ཡིག་ཆེན་མོ] The title of the four heads of the Yigtsang Office (Ecclesiastics Office).">drunyichemmo</a> they can't read properly and just say "la la la". When they could read and write a little bit, they could become the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཆབ་རིལ] The Chabril&#x27;s main work was overseeing serving the traja. He was also the servant of the gegö and khempo. It had a middle status of the types of lene. The chabril was also the one responsible for beating the gong at the tsog and chöra. The chabril got an extra share of gye in the tratsang.">chabril</a> and they had a lot of responsibility under the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. དགེ་སྐོས] The main disciplinary official in a monastic college (tratsang).">gegö</a> and the gegö would get changed and the chabril remains there so they had a lot of experience. <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. བློ་གསལ་གླིང] One of the main colleges in Drepung Monastery.">Loseling</a> Tratsang chabril is responsible when there is the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. གཏོང་སྒོ] A monastic obligation to provide the food and other necessary items served at a monastic prayer assembly meeting or some other rite; this was often a required obligation for monastic officials at the end of their term of office.">tonggo</a> for thousands of monks. They have to cover everything like the distribution and everything and they are personally responsible. If they can't do it properly, the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. གྲྭ་ཇ] The prayer session sponsored by the tratsang (college) at which tea was served to its monks who attended.">traja</a> will be so long and it would become totally disorganized because there is the afternoon khamtsen tsomja and all of those things. In addition to that, the chabril also had the responsibility for coordinating the dignitaries like the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. གྲྭ་ཚང] A &quot;college&quot; within a monastery, for example, in Drepung Monastery there were four main tratsang: Gomang, Loseling, Deyang and Ngagpa. These tratsang were property owning corporate entities and included monks who were organized into residential dormitories called Khamtsen.">tratsang</a> uchö and the incarnated Lamas and they have to coordinate. The incarnated lamas don't come under the gegö. In addition to that, there are the Mönlam period, there are a lot of disciplines and additional disciplines. So the chabril had a lot of responsibility on the discipline. They are not necessary to become chabril, but there are chances .   

**Q:**  Did they become the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཆབ་རིལ] The Chabril&#x27;s main work was overseeing serving the traja. He was also the servant of the gegö and khempo.

It had a middle status of the types of lene. The chabril was also the one responsible for beating the gong at the tsog and chöra. The chabril got an extra share of gye in the tratsang.">chabril</a> in the tratsang.

**A:**  Yes, they were not depa [Tib. སྡེ་པ] they were depa [Tib. འདེད་པ] who go to collect and push them [to pay the loan]. Then they become the depa and then they become <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. བླ་བྲང] 1. The property/wealth owning corporate entity of an incarnate lama. 2.

When the Dalai Lama came to Drepung, Ngagpa started doing it from Gomang. Nendrön influenced Sera Ngagpa and Sera Ngagpa asked Gomang to do it. So Deyang came to Loseling and it became three [laughter] .   

**Q:**  Were there arguments in the monastery after hearing about this?
