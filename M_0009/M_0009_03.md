**Q:**  This is a continuation of the tape on Depung monastery by Gelek Rimpoche on Septermber 5th 1985. The question is (when getting alms at a prayer assembly session) who goes around and gets extra <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. འགྱེ] Alms given to monks.">gye</span> (alms)?   

**A:**  That mostly is the <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. ཞལ་ངོ] 1. a junior officer in the traditional Tibetan Army in charge of a unit of 25 soldiers (same as dingpön). 2. the two head disciplinary officials for all of Drepung monastery and for the Mönlam Prayer Festival.">sheyngo</span> and the <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. དགེ་སྐོས] The main disciplinary official in a monastic college (tratsang).">gegö</span> in the <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. གྲྭ་ཚང] A &quot;college&quot; within a monastery, for example, in Drepung Monastery there were four main tratsang: Gomang, Loseling, Deyang and Ngagpa. These tratsang were property owning corporate entities and included monks who were organized into residential dormitories called Khamtsen.">tratsang</span> and the <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. ནང་མ] A minor monk assistant to the Shengo at the Mönlam Chemmo Prayer Festival. These nangma ranked below the Chagdampa.">nangma</span> [Tib. ནང་མ] <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. ཆབ་རིལ] The Chabril&#x27;s main work was overseeing serving the traja. He was also the servant of the gegö and khempo. It had a middle status of the types of lene. The chabril was also the one responsible for beating the gong at the tsog and chöra. The chabril got an extra share of gye in the tratsang.">chabril</span> in the tratsang and the chagdampa [Tib. ཕྱག་དམ་པ] at the Mönlam. The chösungwa [Tib. ཆོས་སྲུང་བ] also goes. The shanggo shingnyer [Tib. ཞང་གོ་ཤིང་གཉེར] in the Mönlam Festival also goes in addition to that.   

**Q:**  Then in Mönlam, there were specials officials like the <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. དགེ་གཡོག] Monk assistant to the disciplinary official (gegö) in monasteries.">geyog</span> and those stuffs. That kind of control all over Drepung or just <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. བློ་གསལ་གླིང] One of the main colleges in Drepung Monastery.">Loseling</span> and <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. སྒོ་མང] One of the large colleges in Drepung Monastery.">Gomang</span> [Tib. སྒོ་མང]?   

**A:**  For <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. བློ་གསལ་གླིང] One of the main colleges in Drepung Monastery.">Loseling</span>, all of them would go and sometimes, Loseling and Ngagpa [Tib. སྔགས་པ] would be the sheyngo. In the <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. གྲྭ་ཚང] A &quot;college&quot; within a monastery, for example, in Drepung Monastery there were four main tratsang: Gomang, Loseling, Deyang and Ngagpa. These tratsang were property owning corporate entities and included monks who were organized into residential dormitories called Khamtsen.">tratsang</span>, <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. བླ་མ་གཞུང་ལེན་པ] A sort of deputy abbot who was in charge of the scholastic monks (the pechewa).">lama shunglenpa</span> [Tib. བླ་མ་གཞུང་ལེན་པ] doesn't really have much income except those officially in the tratsang, they get only 2 shares. So does the umdze. The <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. དགེ་སྐོས] The main disciplinary official in a monastic college (tratsang).">gegö</span> get a little more and they would say, "give me the reply" [Tib. ལན་ཁྱེར་ཤོག་ཨ].   

**Q:**  What does that mean?   

**A:**  That means if you are involved or make mistakes, you have to tell the <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. དགེ་སྐོས] The main disciplinary official in a monastic college (tratsang).">gegö</span>. The gegö get a lot of money out of that. Any case that comes according to the discipline in the <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. གྲྭ་ཚང] A &quot;college&quot; within a monastery, for example, in Drepung Monastery there were four main tratsang: Gomang, Loseling, Deyang and Ngagpa. These tratsang were property owning corporate entities and included monks who were organized into residential dormitories called Khamtsen.">tratsang</span>, it goes to the gegö and in the <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. ཚོགས་ཆེན] The main assembly hall of a monastery. The assembly hall for the monastery as a whole.">tsogchen</span> it goes to sheyngo. They get a lot of money out of them. They also get a lot of money from the <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. མཁན་པོ] Abbot of a monastery or monastic college.">khembo</span>   

**Q:**  How do people become officials? What is the process?   

**A:**  The process is normally, the monks who have a certain degree on the religious they don't become officials. They were categorized to become <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. དགེ་ཤེས] An advanced degree earned by scholar monks.">geshe</span> and abbot of the tratsang.   

**Q:**  The abbots always comes from the <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. དགེ་ཤེས] An advanced degree earned by scholar monks.">geshe</span>?   

**A:**  Yes because the abbot is responsible for the monk's study also. The abbots don't become official at all.   

**Q:**  The abbots don't have involved?   

**A:**  The abbots don't get involved at all. Some of the monks were called dönsang [Tib. འདོན་བཟང] or kesang [Tib. སྐད་བཟང]. Those were the monks who have a good voice and they were socialized in chanting and they were performing the rituals and the <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. དཔེ་ཆ་བ] A monk studying the monastic philosophical curriculum. A scholar monk.">pechawa</span> memorize the scriptures. Now, another group of monks would neither do the pechawa nor do the dönsang and sometimes they would go little bit here and there and also they know how to read and write. They also knew how to deal with the officials in Lhasa some sort of connections here and there through blood relation or through friends or any thing. They were little bit good at calculation and they have a little bit good relations and little bit of political strategy and little bit business mind. There was a group of them and they become officials and depends on the individual. Some how they were involved in any of the <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. གྲྭ་ཚང] A &quot;college&quot; within a monastery, for example, in Drepung Monastery there were four main tratsang: Gomang, Loseling, Deyang and Ngagpa. These tratsang were property owning corporate entities and included monks who were organized into residential dormitories called Khamtsen.">tratsang</span>'s estate as a depa [Tib. སྡེ་པ] [shidü] and then they become little bigger, they sort of   

**Q:**  How do they have to ask for the position?   

**A:**  All of the <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. ཕྱག་མཛོད] A senior manager/treasurer of an aristocratic or monastic estate, or the senior manager/treasurer of an aristocratic family or a monastic unit. Generally chandzö handled both internal and external issues and were considered higher in power and status than nyerpa (stewards), who typically only handled the storerooms.">chandzö</span> would decide and some of them had the <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. ཕྱག་སྦུག] A manager (of estates and endowments) of a monastic college or monastic khamtsen.">chabu</span> or the chandzö who were their friends and they would decide. I don't believe that sort of they really applied for that. The chabu just asked them to do that. And sometimes, the abbot asked them to do that. The <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. སྦུག་མཛོད] A manager/steward who was in charge of the estates of a monastery or monastic college.">bungdzö</span> [Tib. སྦུག་མཛོད] and the chabu also were led by the abbot and those people would make the decision. Then when they become little more permanent, then it is possible that they they may go into the chabu list and become chabu. The chabu's term is life time. The bungdzö are also done by turn. The bungdzö are also sometimes done by geshes. Some of the small <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. ཁང་ཚན] A monastic residential unit in which monks from specific geographic areas lived. These were corporate entities with property and internal officials. Some large khamtsen had smaller subordinate units called mi tshan. Khamtsen were part of tratsang (colleges). For example, Hamdong Khamtsen was part of Gomang College in Drepung Monastery.">khamtsen</span> are short of people. So when they came to the turn of bungdzö, they ask the people in other khamtsen to be the bungdzö. Phara Khamtsen also had one bungdzö and one <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. བླ་བྲང] 1. The property/wealth owning corporate entity of an incarnate lama. 2. The property/wealth owning corporate entity of the Panchen Lama.">labrang</span> chandzö [Tib. བླ་བྲང་ཕྱག་མཛོད] and they were belonged to Phara Khamtsen. There was one doing the Phara Nyertsang [Tib. གཉེར་ཚང] pluss one Phara Bungdzö who was almost to become a geshe. that is more and less the line of Bungdzö. As for the chabu has to be permanent and well accepted and knows writing and reading which is more important, but their reading and writing is poor and especially their writing is very poor. Among the <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. དཔེ་ཆ་བ] A monk studying the monastic philosophical curriculum. A scholar monk.">pechawa</span>, they didn't have problem on reading, but they don't become chabu. Even during when they show how they look, mibab janshu [Tib. མི་བབ་སྤྱན་ཞུ], to test them properly, [in front] of the <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. དྲུང་ཡིག་ཆེན་མོ] The title of the four heads of the Yigtsang Office (Ecclesiastics Office).">drunyichemmo</span> they can't read properly and just say "la la la".

If they can't do it properly, the <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. གྲྭ་ཇ] The prayer session sponsored by the tratsang (college) at which tea was served to its monks who attended.">traja</span> will be so long and it would become totally disorganized because there is the afternoon khamtsen tsomja and all of those things.

The incarnated lamas don't come under the gegö. In addition to that, there are the Mönlam period, there are a lot of disciplines and additional disciplines.
