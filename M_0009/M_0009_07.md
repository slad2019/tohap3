**Q:**  From Lhasa?   

**A:**  Yes and a lot of cases that have been pending in Lhasa for years, sometimes <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཞལ་ངོ] 1. a junior officer in the traditional Tibetan Army in charge of a unit of 25 soldiers (same as dingpön). 2. the two head disciplinary officials for all of Drepung monastery and for the Mönlam Prayer Festival.">sheyngo</a> will decide that within two weeks.   

**Q:**  They can do that?   

**A:**  Oh, yes, they have twenty-one days they have all the right to do.   

**Q:**  I see, I see, you mean even like over <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. གཞིས་ཀ] A manorial estate.">shiga</a> and <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཕ་གཞིས] A manorial estate that passes from father to son (patrilineally).">phashi</a> and that.   

**A:**  Oh yes they can do any sort of thing but the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཞལ་ངོ] 1. a junior officer in the traditional Tibetan Army in charge of a unit of 25 soldiers (same as dingpön). 2. the two head disciplinary officials for all of Drepung monastery and for the Mönlam Prayer Festival.">sheyngo</a>'s decision may be overturned but, but they can.   

**Q:**  I see, so that is a lot of power.   

**A:**  Oh, its too lot power and the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཞལ་ངོ] 1. a junior officer in the traditional Tibetan Army in charge of a unit of 25 soldiers (same as dingpön). 2. the two head disciplinary officials for all of Drepung monastery and for the Mönlam Prayer Festival.">sheyngo</a> will say even they say-- Above the two of us there's only one and a half man -- the regent they'll count it as half person. so even true today.   

**Q:**  One is Dalai Lama?   

**A:**  Yes, one is Dalai Lama and the other one's the regent...one and half persons, that's all.   

**Q:**  How do they say that in Tibetan?   

**A:**  [Tib. མི་ང་གཉིས་ཀྱི་གོང་ལ་མི་གཅིག་དང་ཕྱེད་ཀ་མ་གཏོགས་མེད].   

**Q:**  That's hysterical.   

**A:**  They don't care diplomat relations, they don't care anything, that's why they say the Nepalese, you remember in the history we have this incident of some one [called] Nyima [Tib. ཉི་མ] something and the thief called Kuma Kangtsug [Tib. རྐུན་མ་རྐང་བཙུགས].   

**Q:**  [called] Gyepo [Tib. རྒྱལ་པོ] something.   

**A:**  Gyepo something and all this, they broke into the Nepalese Office and they even turned down the Nepalese down a couple times and they go and complain to the foreign office and all this but every decisions over. <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཞལ་ངོ] 1. a junior officer in the traditional Tibetan Army in charge of a unit of 25 soldiers (same as dingpön). 2. the two head disciplinary officials for all of Drepung monastery and for the Mönlam Prayer Festival.">sheyngo</a>'s are strange, you know, one of the sheyngo's beats up this interpreter for Tan Guansan, the Chinese General, he lashed the interpreter of the Tan Guansan. I think this is 1950, not so late, I think 1955 or 56, somewhere around there.   

**Q:**  During the Mönlam?   

**A:**  During the Mönlam, Tan Guansan's probably number two or three persons in the Chinese whole setup. And he started riding bicycling near the courtyard, [of the Jokhang] khyamra [Tib. འཁྱམས་ར] and he got a hold of him and straightway, without talk, straightaway 50 lashes. By the time they complain goes up and down, he's already lashed down. And the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. སྡེ་བ་གཞུང] The name of the traditional Tibetan government.">dewashung</a> can say "oh monks do all sorts of rash things." [Tib. གྲྭ་པས་ཐོ་ལོང་མོ་ལོང་བྱས་པ་རེད] That's all, what can they do?   

**Q:**  And that's what the thirteenth Dalai Lama told Sir Charles Bell, the monks are hard to control them, they do what they do.   

**A:**  Yes, they're really hard to control sometimes, they do whatever they want to do, even t the secretary, the cabinent secretary, Dumra's [Tib. ལྡུམ་ར] daughter was lashed by one of the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཞལ་ངོ] 1. a junior officer in the traditional Tibetan Army in charge of a unit of 25 soldiers (same as dingpön). 2. the two head disciplinary officials for all of Drepung monastery and for the Mönlam Prayer Festival.">sheyngo</a> just for wearing some...I don't know...some shoes or something, some foreign made shoes [hin. jur ta].   

**Q:**  When was that?   

**A:**  Ah. sometime in the fifties, I think in the fifties, and by the time Dumra came to know about it, he started to run to <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. མགྲོན་གཉེར་ཆེན་མོ] 1. The Dalai Lama&#x27;s Lord Chamberlain. He was one of the most important monk officials in the Tibetan government and was the head of the Tse ga, the Dalai Lama&#x27;s secretariat. 2. A high economic managerial position in some large monasteries.">drönyerchemmo</a> and drönyerchemmo didn't have time to do his tea as he had to rush and run to <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཞལ་ངོ] 1. a junior officer in the traditional Tibetan Army in charge of a unit of 25 soldiers (same as dingpön). 2. the two head disciplinary officials for all of Drepung monastery and for the Mönlam Prayer Festival.">sheyngo</a> to get stopped. You know, later in the fifties, the drönyerchemmo has a lot of control over sheyngo, where he really tried to control sheyngo very tight. Because, otherwise, sheyngo misbehave a lot. So he have to run, personally, rather than send a message, or something, and by the time drönyerchemmo, reached, the poor girl is already lashed 200 already out.   

**Q:**  On her buttoks?   

**A:**  Yes, 200 hundred, so, thats, I mean you can't take that back. What else can you do? <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཞལ་ངོ] 1. a junior officer in the traditional Tibetan Army in charge of a unit of 25 soldiers (same as dingpön). 2. the two head disciplinary officials for all of Drepung monastery and for the Mönlam Prayer Festival.">sheyngo</a> also knew that they are going to run [to stop them] so they do it quickly, decision quickly, lashed out quickly, throw it out quickly, finished by the time someone comes to.   

**Q:**  So the disciplinary officer in the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. གྲྭ་ཚང] A &quot;college&quot; within a monastery, for example, in Drepung Monastery there were four main tratsang: Gomang, Loseling, Deyang and Ngagpa. These tratsang were property owning corporate entities and included monks who were organized into residential dormitories called Khamtsen.">tratsang</a> is the gegö.   

**A:**  Gegö, <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཚོགས་ཆེན] The main assembly hall of a monastery. The assembly hall for the monastery as a whole.">tsogchen</a> is the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཞལ་ངོ] 1. a junior officer in the traditional Tibetan Army in charge of a unit of 25 soldiers (same as dingpön). 2. the two head disciplinary officials for all of Drepung monastery and for the Mönlam Prayer Festival.">sheyngo</a>, and in the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཁང་ཚན] A monastic residential unit in which monks from specific geographic areas lived. These were corporate entities with property and internal officials. Some large khamtsen had smaller subordinate units called mi tshan. Khamtsen were part of tratsang (colleges). For example, Hamdong Khamtsen was part of Gomang College in Drepung Monastery.">khamtsen</a> is khamtsen gegen.   

**Q:**  But under the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཞལ་ངོ] 1. a junior officer in the traditional Tibetan Army in charge of a unit of 25 soldiers (same as dingpön). 2. the two head disciplinary officials for all of Drepung monastery and for the Mönlam Prayer Festival.">sheyngo</a> is the geyog.   

**A:**  There are two systems, during the Mönlam and <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཚོགས་མཆོད] The large religious prayer festival held in Lhasa in the 2nd Tibetan lunar month.">Tsongjö</a>, there are extended <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཞལ་ངོ] 1. a junior officer in the traditional Tibetan Army in charge of a unit of 25 soldiers (same as dingpön). 2. the two head disciplinary officials for all of Drepung monastery and for the Mönlam Prayer Festival.">sheyngo</a> staff and everyday is a lesser staff; and when the extended period under sheyngo, two <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཕྱག་དམ་པ] The powerful assistant to the Shengo during the Mönlam Chemmo Prayer Festival.">chagdamba</a> [Tib. ཕྱག་དམ་པ] will come and under the chagdamba, two <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ནང་མ] A minor monk assistant to the Shengo at the Mönlam Chemmo Prayer Festival. These nangma ranked below the Chagdampa.">nangma</a> will come and under the nangma, two <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཆབ་རིལ] The Chabril&#x27;s main work was overseeing serving the traja. He was also the servant of the gegö and khempo. It had a middle status of the types of lene. The chabril was also the one responsible for beating the gong at the tsog and chöra. The chabril got an extra share of gye in the tratsang.">chabril</a> will come. So that is one set. So then parallel to chagdamba, there's the shanggo shingnyer [Tib. ཞང་གོ་ཤིང་གཉེར] comes. Its a parallel to chagdamba, but under sheyngo. So, if you draw tree, sheyngo will be here, and then comes chagdamba and then shanggo shingnyer . So under shanggo shingnyer, which actually is a fire wood <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. གཉེར་པ] A steward or manager. In some monasteries, the nyerba was in charge of storerooms under the authority of a higher manager called a chandzö.">nyerba</a>, there are 19 <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. དགེ་གཡོག] Monk assistant to the disciplinary official (gegö) in monasteries.">geyog</a> come. Under chagdamba, there are two nangma, under two nangma, there are two chabril. And under chabril...I don't know...jama and things like that, I think. So and all the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཐབ་གཡོག] Monks or laymen who work as servants/manual laborers in kitchens (normally monastic kitchens).">thabyog</a> will come under here when it is extended, it comes under geyog. So, this is the kitchen staff, actually.   

**Q:**  The <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. དགེ་གཡོག] Monk assistant to the disciplinary official (gegö) in monasteries.">geyog</a>? or what's the kitchen staff?   

**A:**  <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཤིང་གཉེར] The monk in charge of firewood at the Mönlam Prayer Festival.">Shingnyer</a> is in kitchen, so the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. དགེ་གཡོག] Monk assistant to the disciplinary official (gegö) in monasteries.">geyog</a> are have to based in the kitchen. So, t<a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཞྭ་མོ; ch. 戴帽] 1. A regular hat, cap. 2. A common political slang term (label) used for people who were classified as class enemies or reactionaries. It was used politically as, &quot;They put the hat on him,&quot; or &quot;They never took his hat off.&quot;">hat</a> is,.. and during the normal period, everyday period, the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཕྱག་དམ་པ] The powerful assistant to the Shengo during the Mönlam Chemmo Prayer Festival.">chagdamba</a> are not there. So the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ནང་མ] A minor monk assistant to the Shengo at the Mönlam Chemmo Prayer Festival. These nangma ranked below the Chagdampa.">nangma</a> and <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཆབ་རིལ] The Chabril&#x27;s main work was overseeing serving the traja. He was also the servant of the gegö and khempo. It had a middle status of the types of lene. The chabril was also the one responsible for beating the gong at the tsog and chöra. The chabril got an extra share of gye in the tratsang.">chabril</a> will stay. <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཞལ་ངོ] 1. a junior officer in the traditional Tibetan Army in charge of a unit of 25 soldiers (same as dingpön). 2. the two head disciplinary officials for all of Drepung monastery and for the Mönlam Prayer Festival.">sheyngo</a> and nangma and... each sheyngo will bring each nangma, there will be two nangma and each nangma will bring each chabril, there will be two chabril. So the nangma is the sort of, you know, normally the sheyngo will bring their own personal person, a <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཤག་ཚང] 1. The household or family of a monk that consisted of multiple monks. 2. The apartment of a monk household.">shagtsang</a> fellow. And the young ones, the younger ones were chabril, whose job is to carry his stick and hat and shout "Oh chojo" [Tib. ?] when the sheyngo is going around. 2 sheyngo, 2 chagdamba, 2 shanggo shingyer, 2 nangma, 19 geyog, 2 chabril.   

**Q:**  He has to shout that everywhere?   

**A:**  Everywhere <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཞལ་ངོ] 1. a junior officer in the traditional Tibetan Army in charge of a unit of 25 soldiers (same as dingpön). 2. the two head disciplinary officials for all of Drepung monastery and for the Mönlam Prayer Festival.">sheyngo</a> goes they shout. [yes] "Oh Chojo" they shout all the time, everywhere. Wherever he is going.   

**Q:**  Even in Lhasa, during Mönlam?   

**A:**  Oh yes, more so. Yes, they try to show off too.   

**Q:**  And he's got this big long thing. What's it called?   

**A:**  Jagyug [Tib. ལྕགས་རྒྱུག], iron stick. Big long Jagyug. And the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཆབ་རིལ] The Chabril&#x27;s main work was overseeing serving the traja. He was also the servant of the gegö and khempo. It had a middle status of the types of lene. The chabril was also the one responsible for beating the gong at the tsog and chöra. The chabril got an extra share of gye in the tratsang.">chabril</a> will carry it on the shoulder like this, sort of like you're carrying the gun. Soldiers carry the gun type of thing. And put the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཞྭ་མོ; ch. 戴帽] 1. A regular hat, cap. 2. A common political slang term (label) used for people who were classified as class enemies or reactionaries. It was used politically as, &quot;They put the hat on him,&quot; or &quot;They never took his hat off.&quot;">hat</a> of the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཞལ་ངོ] 1. a junior officer in the traditional Tibetan Army in charge of a unit of 25 soldiers (same as dingpön). 2. the two head disciplinary officials for all of Drepung monastery and for the Mönlam Prayer Festival.">sheyngo</a> on top of the jagyug and then they go walk, that's how they walk. And they keep on shouting "Oh, chojo" all the time. I think in Lhasa, during the Mönlam period, I think <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. དགེ་གཡོག] Monk assistant to the disciplinary official (gegö) in monasteries.">geyog</a> will carry rather than the chabril, this stick, geyog will carry rather than chabril.

Everything sheyngo, I think, sheyngo appoints, --chagdamba, Im not sure-- but I think sheyngo appoints. I don't think it is a government appointment, I think it is sheyngo appointment. Normally, once you get a <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. དགེ་གཡོག] Monk assistant to the disciplinary official (gegö) in monasteries.">geyog</a>, you are likely to get every year, but every year you have to get a new approved by each sheyngo. But most likely sheyngo will take you, unless he is unhappy. Either your financial contribution to him or some personal reasons, but most probably geyog will be there, mostly.   

**Q:**  So, when a new <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཞལ་ངོ] 1. a junior officer in the traditional Tibetan Army in charge of a unit of 25 soldiers (same as dingpön). 2. the two head disciplinary officials for all of Drepung monastery and for the Mönlam Prayer Festival.">sheyngo</a> is picked then, all the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. དགེ་གཡོག] Monk assistant to the disciplinary official (gegö) in monasteries.">geyog</a> have to give like gift?

In the evening, and every time at the confess session, the geyog have to pay money to shanggo shingnyer. The four senior geyog sitting there and the shanggo shingnyer sitting face down and the shanggo shingnyer will say, "you did something something, you did something." They have some kind of note, somebody get information, --you made some mistake your hat has fall down, your...robe they tied it here, has slipped out, you have forgotten to collect so and so, and you have no reach there, you have not done that, and hundreds of these come. And everytime they have to put one money on the table.   

**Q:**  Can you swear by the three Jewels?   

**A:**  Yes. And then they don't have enough money, they sort of send hands out like this, and the next one will put money in hands like this. So they keep on paying it there and then they finally he is through and the next one will come and then he goes back and with additionally money starts the same thing with another. And afterwards he says "You owe me this, you owe me that -- I'll owe you this, I'll give you that money and you'll owe me this."   

**Q:**  That's everyday?

**A:**  During Mönlam and <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཚོགས་མཆོད] The large religious prayer festival held in Lhasa in the 2nd Tibetan lunar month.">Tsongjö</a>, its everyday.   

**Q:**  Now, <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཚོགས་མཆོད] The large religious prayer festival held in Lhasa in the 2nd Tibetan lunar month.">Tsongjö</a> is separate from Mönlam but Drepung is in charge of that too?

**Q:**  How many days?   

**A:**  About 12 days.   

**Q:**  Nobody really talks about that... people only say that its Mönlam that   

**A:**  Because Mönlam overpowers <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཚོགས་མཆོད] The large religious prayer festival held in Lhasa in the 2nd Tibetan lunar month.">Tsongjö</a> ...but Tsongjö is equal... <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཞལ་ངོ] 1. a junior officer in the traditional Tibetan Army in charge of a unit of 25 soldiers (same as dingpön). 2. the two head disciplinary officials for all of Drepung monastery and for the Mönlam Prayer Festival.">sheyngo</a> make more money in Tsongjö than Mönlam.

**A:**  Mönlam is busy, rushed, there are a lot of things happening, so that they don't get deep down to something and <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཚོགས་མཆོད] The large religious prayer festival held in Lhasa in the 2nd Tibetan lunar month.">Tsongjö</a>, the days are much longer and they have a lot of time, they are not that busy like in Mönlam, so they go around and dig a lot of cases and disputes and try to catch thieves...things like that, they do more...so because everytime whatever they can do, they get something too... I mean, like, if you catch thief, you can gobble up all the property.   

**Q:**  Whose? the thief's?   

**A:**  The thief's property, <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཞལ་ངོ] 1. a junior officer in the traditional Tibetan Army in charge of a unit of 25 soldiers (same as dingpön). 2. the two head disciplinary officials for all of Drepung monastery and for the Mönlam Prayer Festival.">sheyngo</a> gets all of it, straightaway.   

**Q:**  How does you know he's a thief?   

**A:**  Well, there is a complaint here and there. it comes from here and there and you know some stolen this and that...and somebody else will come and say "I'm quite sure the thief is so and so." Probably They arrest so and so and lashed out. And lash them out and they say I'm not alone...who else with you... and they go and catch all of them. So that's how they catch all the thieves. And the moment they catch the thief, more or less they get approved and they just gobble up all their property. The whole property.   

**Q:**  You mean like rugs and pots?   

**A:**  Rugs, pots, money, clothes, <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཕྱུ་པ] The traditional Tibetan men and women&#x27;s dress. It is like a robe that is tied at the waist. Both men and women wear such dresses, although they differ slightly in color and in style.">chupa</a>, amulets [Tib. གའུ] gold, silver whatever, well they take it with them, then afterwards they sell it. There's no time to sell at that moment. They just store it, that's all. And the moment you enter in the house, you know what the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. དགེ་གཡོག] Monk assistant to the disciplinary official (gegö) in monasteries.">geyog</a> will do? Whatever they can see they start putting it in their pockets, including geyog and <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཐབ་གཡོག] Monks or laymen who work as servants/manual laborers in kitchens (normally monastic kitchens).">thabyog</a> and chagmamba. That's what they do. Thats what they do.   

**Q:**  You mean, if they go to a monks house?   

**A:**  Whoever it is , if you happen to be a thief, they have to be a thief. Everything is going to be taken anyway so will be take.   

**Q:**  But they couldn't go to just a regular person's house and take the stuffs?   

**A:**  No, no, not like that. Unless its a complaint in the court and confirmed. Then they do that very often. Then, if the thief is caught, first thing they remove are the watches and then their thumbring and earing and everything they take it away. And the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཞལ་ངོ] 1. a junior officer in the traditional Tibetan Army in charge of a unit of 25 soldiers (same as dingpön). 2. the two head disciplinary officials for all of Drepung monastery and for the Mönlam Prayer Festival.">sheyngo</a> will inquire "Where did earring go?" Someone says "I don't know, the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. དགེ་གཡོག] Monk assistant to the disciplinary official (gegö) in monasteries.">geyog</a> get it. That's what happens.   

**Q:**  So that can be very profitable.   

**A:**  Oh yes, Very profitable. They make more money in Tsongjö. And then they also go through this protectors [Tib. ལྷ], they will go the protectors and say, "oh there are a lot of theives, so please help us to catch them. We heard there's a lot of thieves going on there so please we've got a few days left, please help us to catch them". Sometimes, those, they will offer advise you know, saying why don't you do this, this and this.   

**Q:**  Protectors, meaning the,   

**A:**  The oracle.   

**Q:**  The ones who go into trance?   

**A:**  Yes. some of them will say, "Yes, do this and do that" and they help a lot.   

**Q:**  I see, are different <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. གྲྭ་ཚང] A &quot;college&quot; within a monastery, for example, in Drepung Monastery there were four main tratsang: Gomang, Loseling, Deyang and Ngagpa. These tratsang were property owning corporate entities and included monks who were organized into residential dormitories called Khamtsen.">tratsang</a> associated with different oracles? Or is it just personal?   

**A:**  More personal, more personal...a little more personal. But Drepung associated with <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. གནས་ཆུང] 1.

These tratsang were property owning corporate entities and included monks who were organized into residential dormitories called Khamtsen.">tratsang</a> really different here and there, you know. This is another total set of all this, a total different world there again at work.   

**Q:**  So that's Drepung, or did you say <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. བློ་གསལ་གླིང] One of the main colleges in Drepung Monastery.">Loseling</a>?   

**A:**  Drepung.   

**Q:**  And like Sera would have different ones?   

**A:**  Sera would have different ones, Sera will have Thawo [Tib. ཐུབ་འོག], whole different set up there.   

**Q:**  Like Shungden [Tib. ཤུགས་ལྡན] and that, who   

**A:**  Shungden doesn't belong to any one of those big monasteries, no...new comer.   

**Q:**  New comer . But these ones like Gadong. Say they are supposed to be monks too but they're not monks?   

**A:**  You mean the oracle?   

**Q:**  Yes.   

**A:**  Sometimes they're monks, sometimes they're not. Doesn't matter but...whether you are monk or not monk, you wear monks robes.   

**Q:**  When you do this?   

**A:**  No, everyday.   

**Q:**  Well, can they get married?   

**A:**  Yes, the famous Gadong Oracle has four or five sons.   

**Q:**  And then he has like a <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. བླ་བྲང] 1. The property/wealth owning corporate entity of an incarnate lama. 2. The property/wealth owning corporate entity of the Panchen Lama.">labrang</a> or what? I mean that he inherits or what?   

**A:**  No, nothing, nothing.   

**Q:**  How is someone like that picked? Is that under the control of the monastery?   

**A:**  No, whoever get the trance and the correct trance. And that one can be picked it up, it doesn't matter, whoever you meet, you have nothing to do with that monastery. You get a trance and it proves to be the correct one.   

**Q:**  How would you prove it?   

**A:**  Well, there are under lot of different tests for that. Another already approved oracle, a different lamas, different, like a <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. གནས་ཆུང] 1. One of the main protector deities of the Tibetan government and the Dalai Lama. 2. The monastery in which the medium of Nechung resides that is located just east of Drepung Monastery.">Nechung</a> and Gadong, I think has to be approved by the Dalai Lama and others, I don't think they have to be approved by the Dalai Lama. But in the case of the Tenma it is hereditary-- always the daughters of the family got Tenma.   

**Q:**  So the oracle is a female?   

**A:**  The oracle is female in the Tenma case, the oracle is a female. I think Thamba Simkhang [Tib. དན་འབག་གཟིམ་ཁང].   

**Q:**  Tenma is spelled how?   

**A:**  [Tib. བསྟན་མ] Ah...in Drepung, up there, there is a little, now I believe there's a little garden, there, that's Tenma house.   

**Q:**  Outside the wall?   

**A:**  Outside, quite a way out. Sort of upper part there, on the other side of...that's hereditary, Tenma.   

**Q:**  Is that the only woman?   

**A:**  No, Pushar [Tib. ཕུ་ཤར], another one of them called Pushar, that's also a woman. There are quite a lot of women there now.   

**Q:**  Okay, so that's a little bit about the discipline, let me get back to the shöndre. So, I still am not quite sure how this goes. You (enter) the monastery about eight or nine years old...just a regular monk...now how would you usually do it, let's say, ummm, why don't you explain if you were a parent and you had a son, how this would all work?   

**A:**  You want to enter monastery?   

**Q:**  Yes.   

**A:**  The way you enter is first you look for somebody who take you, a gegen. Not necessarily the teacher who'll teach you, but who'll be responsible for you in the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཁང་ཚན] A monastic residential unit in which monks from specific geographic areas lived. These were corporate entities with property and internal officials. Some large khamtsen had smaller subordinate units called mi tshan. Khamtsen were part of tratsang (colleges). For example, Hamdong Khamtsen was part of Gomang College in Drepung Monastery.">khamtsen</a> or tratsang.   

**Q:**  You have to have one of those.   

**A:**  You have to have one of those. So that fellow will say well, he's been one of my <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. དགེ་ཕྲུག] 1. Student. 2. Disciple. 3. Commonly the name for monks living with a gegen or teacher. These are more like wards than real disciples.">gidru</a> and I'm going to enter him.   

**Q:**  Well, how would you find someone like that?   

**A:**  Through friends, through families, and then also there are systems like you know, different villages belongs to different khamtsen. You know, through the different contacts. That's a very very strong system. Like in Nyare Khamtsen, the whole Traya [Tib. བྲག་གཡབ], Gonjo [Tib. གོ་འཇོ], belongs to Nyare. Mangkham [Tib. སྨར་ཁམས] belongs to Phukang [Tib. ཕུ་ཁང]. And sertain portions belongs to Tsha [Tib. ཚ་བ], or <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཨ་མདོ] One of the three main Tibetan sub-ethnic areas. It is located in the northeast of the Tibetan Plateau mostly in today&#x27;s Qinghai Province. A person from Amdo is called an Amdowa.">Amdo</a> goes to <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. སྒོ་མང] One of the large colleges in Drepung Monastery.">Gomang</a> and also divide where which part of the Amdo they go.   

**Q:**  So Nyare Khamtsen is all Khampas then?   

**A:**  Mostly Khampas, and then are are like from the central Tibet, Üba [Tib. དབུས་པ], who comes into Nyare Khamtsen, actually have a personal friend, somebody, and who is will say, "Alright, I'll take your son." And then, they say "OK, I'm going to join the Nyare Khamtsen."   

**Q:**  I see.   

**A:**  You can do that.   

**Q:**  Even if you are not from the normal area?   

**A:**  Even if you are not from that area...you can do that if you choose...provided that the other side does not really raise hell out of it.   

**Q:**  The other side, like normally the Üba would be from where?   

**A:**  Depends. Like if you are from <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. གཙང] One of the major sub-areas of Tibet that is located in southwest Tibet.

**Q:**  Oh yea.   

**A:**  Yea. Each one of those.   

**Q:**  No kidding.   

**A:**  Everybody has his own.   

**Q:**  Only one <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཁང་ཚན] A monastic residential unit in which monks from specific geographic areas lived. These were corporate entities with property and internal officials. Some large khamtsen had smaller subordinate units called mi tshan. Khamtsen were part of tratsang (colleges). For example, Hamdong Khamtsen was part of Gomang College in Drepung Monastery.">khamtsen</a>, one in each monastery?   

**A:**  One in each monastery.   

**Q:**  I see, so Surkhang [Tib. ཟུར་ཁང] would have one and   

**A:**  I think Surkhang probably belongs to Tsangpa.   

**Q:**  There is Ngari [Tib. མངའ་རིས] Khamtsen?   

**A:**  Yes, there is Ngari in Gomang. In <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. བློ་གསལ་གླིང] One of the main colleges in Drepung Monastery.">Loseling</a> there must be Tsangba. Tsarong [Tib. ཚ་རོང] is Tsangba, Surkhang maybe not.   

**Q:**  But there isn't anything called like Üba?   

**A:**  No, there is no <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཁང་ཚན] A monastic residential unit in which monks from specific geographic areas lived. These were corporate entities with property and internal officials. Some large khamtsen had smaller subordinate units called mi tshan. Khamtsen were part of tratsang (colleges).

**A:**  No, you don't, you don't. You go ahead and do it and don't say. If they want to complain, they complain. And they you try to settle later.   

**Q:**  Why would they care?   

**A:**  Depends, if the family's a wealthy family and sort of, you are losing your support. That's why they care. And Labrang, they a lot because there is a considerable benefit to the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཁང་ཚན] A monastic residential unit in which monks from specific geographic areas lived.

So, the monk who is responsible, will tell the khamtsen gegen that I'm entering so and so and please enter his name on the list and then he puts his seal on the list.   

**Q:**  The teacher?   

**A:**  The teacher. That means under his seal. So he'll be responsible.   

**Q:**  But isn't there something where the abbot or somebody has to say "Are you from a good family?" or you know   

**A:**  Not in this time.   

**Q:**  Not in this time.   

**A:**  Not in this time.   

**Q:**  I see   

**A:**  This becomes a sort of vinaya rule, the monk's rules, that comes much later or even before. That's different matter.   

**Q:**  So this is, he puts the seal on?   

**A:**  He puts his seal on the list when he comes into the entrance and so and so gidrü and then he is responsible thereafter. Thereafter you become a monk whether you are a vinaya monk rule or not [i.e. whether you have vows] You shave your head, put a robe on and start enjoying it.   

**Q:**  What are you called then?   

**A:**  They call them new monks [Tib. གྲྭ་པ་གསར་པ].   

**Q:**  Like <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. དགེ་ཚུལ] 1. The novice vows that Buddhist monks and nuns take. 2. A monk who has taken such vows.">getsül</a>, they don't call them?   

**A:**  No...don't call that, that is the technical name for...I don't know...   

**Q:**  So you're just called new monk?   

**A:**  Just new monk.   

**Q:**  But he wouldn't have any vows? I mean   

**A:**  It doesn't matter.   

**Q:**  Well, if somebody gave him vows, would he   

**A:**  Not immediately.   

**Q:**  No?   

**A:**  Not necessarily.   

**Q:**  So he'd just go to live with his teacher?   

**A:**  Yea, with his teacher or maybe he has his own set-up..who knows? If you are wealthy people you can have your own set-up and start living there.

**Q:**  Is there a book?   

**A:**  Not really a written book. It is unwritten understanding there. Any Thopkhung that comes in and anybody, let's say, when you have, I remember that very often, 15-20 or 30 young [from] Traya, Gonjo, all the type they come and sits down there and then they, some monks like <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. གཉེར་པ] A steward or manager. In some monasteries, the nyerba was in charge of storerooms under the authority of a higher manager called a chandzö.">nyerba</a>, go up and down and they say "Hey, you have anybody, any letter to anybody, anything like that?" And they say, "Yes, I have my uncle is here, my aunt and something here and there's a letter for the nyerba to read the letter and call the monk and that monk will pick up. And those who have not been picked it up were left there and then they will say...you know 20 more left there. Here's now twenty more. And who are they and then you said last time up to here and now its your turn. They go from the beginning and start.   

**Q:**  It starts from seniority.   

**A:**  Seniority, it comes from the seniority. This is the senior tax. There escape the seven more probably [the highest 7 seniors]. And after the seven, then it will start, sometimes it will go from the top. And it comes up to the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཚོགས་འདུ] 1. The general name for the various types of Tibetan government assemblies. 2. Any assembly, e.g., the assembly (meeting) of monks in a college.">tsondu</a> and they doesn't go below the tsondu. It all has to be tsondu people. And they will come and then they say there are twenty of them and will call 20 monk who are in their turn. And 20 will come out, so "Who gets whom?" So <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. གཉེར་པ] A steward or manager. In some monasteries, the nyerba was in charge of storerooms under the authority of a higher manager called a chandzö.">nyerba</a> will say "OK, take off your shoe lace," and they will take off everybody's one shoe lace out and they will be left there and they each one of them pick up a shoe lace. That's how they pick it.   

**Q:**  I see... And they have to keep them for how long?   

**A:**  Well, supposed to be forever, but...then   

**Q:**  Well these guys, I mean these people from Traya don't stay for long, do they?   

**A:**  Oh, they do. Some of them, many of them stay for a lifetime.   

**Q:**  Some of them go back after a few years?   

**A:**  Some of them go back after a few years but most of them stay for lifetime.   

**Q:**  So they become what, like servants for the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. དགེ་རྒན] 1. Teacher in a school. 2. In monastic settings it also refers to an adult monk who acted as a guardian to a younger monk. In such cases, the younger monk typically lived in the gegen&#x27;s apartment (shag). In monasteries, however, it could also mean a real teacher, or the monk who served as the guarantor for a new monk.">gegen</a>?   

**A:**  No, you can't be really servant either, you become <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. དགེ་ཕྲུག] 1. Student. 2. Disciple. 3. Commonly the name for monks living with a gegen or teacher. These are more like wards than real disciples.">gidru</a> and you start helping a little bit in the house...he'll probably say sweep the floor or...but whatever he eats he has to share with him...all of a sudden you've got extra expenses, that's what happens.   

**Q:**  I see, even if you already have gidru.   

**A:**  Yes, even you already have <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. དགེ་ཕྲུག] 1. Student. 2. Disciple. 3. Commonly the name for monks living with a gegen or teacher. These are more like wards than real disciples.">gidru</a> and then some big...some big <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཤག་ཚང] 1. The household or family of a monk that consisted of multiple monks. 2. The apartment of a monk household.">shagtsang</a> will volunteer or they want more people, more workers, more helpers, that's very few cases. When they have volunteers, they really select, then you can't do that type, you can do it later...but not that time much, but that's very few.   

**Q:**  When the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཤག་ཚང] 1. The household or family of a monk that consisted of multiple monks. 2. The apartment of a monk household.">shagtsang</a> needs people?   

**A:**  Yea, they really look for them.   

**Q:**  How do they look, I really don't understand how they do this, do they interview people?   

**A:**  No..not that way, you know say there are 800 or 900 monks in the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཁང་ཚན] A monastic residential unit in which monks from specific geographic areas lived. These were corporate entities with property and internal officials. Some large khamtsen had smaller subordinate units called mi tshan. Khamtsen were part of tratsang (colleges). For example, Hamdong Khamtsen was part of Gomang College in Drepung Monastery.">khamtsen</a>, right? Everybody knows everybody...so you become friends okay, would you like to join me now, sometimes they just join the shagtsang.   

**Q:**  Somebody else's gidru.   

**A:**  Somebody else's <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. དགེ་ཕྲུག] 1. Student. 2. Disciple. 3. Commonly the name for monks living with a gegen or teacher. These are more like wards than real disciples.">gidru</a> will go and into someone else's <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཤག་ཚང] 1. The household or family of a monk that consisted of multiple monks. 2. The apartment of a monk household.">shagtsang</a>; very often that happens.   

**Q:**  See, because I found in Ladakh, when I was in that monastery, that some of the monks became very rich through being painters [Tib. ལྷ་བྲིས] for the Indian army painting pictures of dragons and that, very wealthy. You know, they didn't know what to do with their money basically, much and so they were the ones taking in two or three <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. དགེ་ཕྲུག] 1. Student. 2. Disciple. 3. Commonly the name for monks living with a gegen or teacher. These are more like wards than real disciples.">gidru</a> because they had a lot of money so they'd spend it on gidru. But if somebody had three or four already they'd still make them take one more?   

**A:**  Oh, yes...that's turn by turn whether you have two or three or ten or none, doesn't matter, it's your turn.   

**Q:**  Is this a pattern in the monastery, that richer monks tend to take more <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. དགེ་ཕྲུག] 1. Student. 2. Disciple. 3. Commonly the name for monks living with a gegen or teacher. These are more like wards than real disciples.">gidru</a>?   

**A:**  No, no it's not, not in Drepung. Mostly the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཤག་ཚང] 1. The household or family of a monk that consisted of multiple monks. 2. The apartment of a monk household.">shagtsang</a> business they have their nephews or some of the other relations that come through.   

**Q:**  And then at some point, then you have to go to the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. མཁན་པོ] The abbot of a monastery or monastic college.">khempo</a>, the teacher takes you?   

**A:**  The teacher takes you to the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. མཁན་པོ] The abbot of a monastery or monastic college.">khempo</a>, no, teacher takes you to the --No, the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཁང་ཚན་དགེ་རྒན] The head official of a khamtsen.">khamtsen gegen</a> takes you to the khempo. For the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. གྲྭ་ཚང] A &quot;college&quot; within a monastery, for example, in Drepung Monastery there were four main tratsang: Gomang, Loseling, Deyang and Ngagpa. These tratsang were property owning corporate entities and included monks who were organized into residential dormitories called Khamtsen.">tratsang</a>, it is the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཁང་ཚན] A monastic residential unit in which monks from specific geographic areas lived.

For example, Hamdong Khamtsen was part of Gomang College in Drepung Monastery.">khamtsen</a> is the responsible. For khamtsen, your teacher is responsible, so that's what I think khamtsen gegen takes you to the khempo. They call it new audience, <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. མཁན་པོ] Abbot of a monastery or monastic college.">khembo</a> sanjey [Tib. gsar mjal---so khempo may have then 10, 20, 30 or 40 monks whatever that day.   

**Q:**  At the same time?   

**A:**  At the same time.   

**Q:**  And says the same thing to all of them?   

**A:**  I dont think they say too much. no, I don't think so... some <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. མཁན་པོ] The abbot of a monastery or monastic college.">khempo</a> will say "Well, you have come to this great monastery and you have to learn abd behave" and some khempo say not a word. (Just) touch their heads, whatever.   

**Q:**  Nobody asks them, "Are you from a good background or a bad background"   

**A:**  That was when you take a vow --that period..."Have you been killing somebody" then there's a set pattern of answers, "No, no, no, no, yes, yes, yes, yes" that sort of thing.   

**Q:**  I see, that's where you take the vows...that's separate still?   

**A:**  That's totally separate.   

**Q:**  That's before or have to be after, or anytime?   

**A:**  That can be before or after.   

**Q:**  So the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. མཁན་པོ] The abbot of a monastery or monastic college.">khempo</a>'s time is when you registered in the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. གྲྭ་ཚང] A &quot;college&quot; within a monastery, for example, in Drepung Monastery there were four main tratsang: Gomang, Loseling, Deyang and Ngagpa. These tratsang were property owning corporate entities and included monks who were organized into residential dormitories called Khamtsen.">tratsang</a>?

**Q:**  There's ten thousand monks.   

**A:**  Yes, there's ten thousand monks, whose gonna know who's who. There's no way. Even a non-monk can shave hair and wear a robe who'll know?

For example, Hamdong Khamtsen was part of Gomang College in Drepung Monastery.">khamtsen</a> level, and <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཚོགས་ཆེན] The main assembly hall of a monastery. The assembly hall for the monastery as a whole.">tsogchen</a> level. All three levels. And it is more sort of organized in <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. གྲྭ་ཚང] A &quot;college&quot; within a monastery, for example, in Drepung Monastery there were four main tratsang: Gomang, Loseling, Deyang and Ngagpa. These tratsang were property owning corporate entities and included monks who were organized into residential dormitories called Khamtsen.">tratsang</a> and tsogchen, less in khamtsen but it's there. It's there.   

**Q:**  When you say they are at all three levels, its the same people though. No?   

**Q:**  Not necessary. Some are in the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. གྲྭ་ཚང] A &quot;college&quot; within a monastery, for example, in Drepung Monastery there were four main tratsang: Gomang, Loseling, Deyang and Ngagpa. These tratsang were property owning corporate entities and included monks who were organized into residential dormitories called Khamtsen.">tratsang</a> level dönsang kesang but not in the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཚོགས་ཆེན] The main assembly hall of a monastery. The assembly hall for the monastery as a whole.">tsogchen</a> dönsang kesang...tape goes blank.   

**Q:**  Not necessarily in the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཁང་ཚན] A monastic residential unit in which monks from specific geographic areas lived. These were corporate entities with property and internal officials. Some large khamtsen had smaller subordinate units called mi tshan. Khamtsen were part of tratsang (colleges). For example, Hamdong Khamtsen was part of Gomang College in Drepung Monastery.">khamtsen</a>?   

**A:**  No, also tratsang.   

**Q:**  So how are people recuited into it?   

**A:**  Actually they say the umdze will do it mostly.   

**Q:**  Now these umdze are in <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཚོགས་ཆེན] The main assembly hall of a monastery. The assembly hall for the monastery as a whole.">tsogchen</a>, <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. གྲྭ་ཚང] A &quot;college&quot; within a monastery, for example, in Drepung Monastery there were four main tratsang: Gomang, Loseling, Deyang and Ngagpa. These tratsang were property owning corporate entities and included monks who were organized into residential dormitories called Khamtsen.">tratsang</a> umdze, <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཁང་ཚན] A monastic residential unit in which monks from specific geographic areas lived.

For example, Hamdong Khamtsen was part of Gomang College in Drepung Monastery.">khamtsen</a> umdze.   

**A:**  Yes, oh yes.   

**Q:**  You were telling me about this dönsang kesang and the different levels, how people are recuited. Like three things simultaneously going on?   

**A:**  There's two stages. Dönsang and then finally, I think kesang.   

**Q:**  Oh, I see.   

**A:**  I think first become dönsang and then kesang. Then when you say dönsang and kesang it becomes one category. Three things simultaneous level. In the monastery, there are so many things going on. The administration is whole thing going on; like the group people who become a <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཞལ་ངོ] 1. a junior officer in the traditional Tibetan Army in charge of a unit of 25 soldiers (same as dingpön). 2. the two head disciplinary officials for all of Drepung monastery and for the Mönlam Prayer Festival.">sheyngo</a> and <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. གཉེར་པ] A steward or manager. In some monasteries, the nyerba was in charge of storerooms under the authority of a higher manager called a chandzö.">nyerba</a>, <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཕྱག་མཛོད] A senior manager/treasurer of an aristocratic or monastic estate, or the senior manager/treasurer of an aristocratic family or a monastic unit. Generally chandzö handled both internal and external issues and were considered higher in power and status than nyerpa (stewards), who typically only handled the storerooms.">chandzö</a> and <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. སྦུག་མཛོད] A manager/steward who was in charge of the estates of a monastery or monastic college.">bungdzö</a> and <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. དགེ་སྐོས] The main disciplinary official in a monastic college (tratsang).">gegö</a>, all this is one category. Then the dönsang kesang and umdze is another category. And then the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. དཔེ་ཆ་བ] A monk studying the monastic philosophical curriculum. A scholar monk.">pechawa</a> and <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. དགེ་ཤེས] An advanced degree earned by scholar monks.">geshe</a> and the lama shunglenba [Tib. བླ་མ་གཞུང་ལེན་པ], there's another category. So the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. མཁན་པོ] Abbot of a monastery or monastic college.">khembo</a> comes in the middle. Under <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. མཁན་པོ] The abbot of a monastery or monastic college.">khempo</a> like three divisions, gegö, sheyngo, etc that's one category. Then comes the dönsang kesang as another category, and then the lama shunglemba and the geshe and pechawa   

**Q:**  Lama shunglemba is the teacher, is the one in charge of teaching?   

**A:**  Not the teacher...its supposed to be [the one] in charge of the monks who are doing study. The three top ones are Gegö, shunglenba and umdze, these are the three, they are called the three uchö [Tib. དབུ་ཆོས་གསུ]. That is the three pillars of the tratsang.   

**Q:**  Is it said pillars in Tibetan?   

**A:**  I don't...they do have their own way of saying it...the dönsang kesang will tell you they are the pillars, yes. Actually its true-- for outsiders, even inside the monastery, people will, if you don't pay attention, it'll look like all the monks are saying the prayers and thing like that, but there are a group who are really responsible for the whole group there. Totally responsible for the tunes and things and umdze can make a lot of mistake, that's true. But then they are there to correct immediately.   

**Q:**  I see.   

**A:**  For example, the present, when we lived, 1959, the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. བློ་གསལ་གླིང] One of the main colleges in Drepung Monastery.">Loseling</a> umdze who became <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཚོགས་ཆེན] The main assembly hall of a monastery. The assembly hall for the monastery as a whole.">tsogchen</a> umdze in India, didn't know anything about it except he had very good voice. So he doesn't have even words, few words, but beyond that he doesn't even know. So he only know how to start. Well, very good voice, he start "oommmmm" thick voice and they pick up like "wawawawaong wawawawaong" and he doesn't have words.   

**Q:**  So, why did they pick him as?   

**A:**  Because his voice...and because of his looks, good voice. Pool all together. But the core group there is the dönsang kesang, they really take the tune, they shape it.   

**Q:**  Is that considered prestigeous in the monastery?   

**A:**  I don't think so. It's not that prestigeous either. But without that, they can never be function. No way.   

**Q:**  So of the prestigeous, they most do what - the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. དཔེ་ཆ་བ] A monk studying the monastic philosophical curriculum. A scholar monk.">pechawa</a>?   

**A:**  They are not really prestigeous either. No, I mean they are sort of (one) of them but don't really see anything as prestigeous.   

**Q:**  So what's prestigeous in the monastery?   

**A:**  Geshe, one thing, and uh, and the officials beside the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. སྤྲུལ་སྐུ] An incarnate lama.">trüku</a> and chöndze. So the ultimate goal of the dönsang kesang is to be umdze. But then sometimes you know some funny thing happen and umdze will be changed.   

**Q:**  Like umdze is for how many years?   

**A:**  Oh, I think they remain there, though the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. མཁན་པོ] The abbot of a monastery or monastic college.">khempo</a>, everytime, the khempo will decide, but khempo, everytime they decide, I think 6 years, I don't think they change much. When the new khempo comes in, there will can I continue, and they say yea, they will continue, so probably, I think, automatically. But then if something happens to the present umdze, then there is choice of new umdze, then khempo has lot of to do. But <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. དགེ་སྐོས] The main disciplinary official in a monastic college (tratsang).">gegö</a> are appointed by khempo, but not like this, I think like 6 years after they appoint, its very strange.   

**Q:**  What do you mean?   

**A:**  Khempo's period is six years...so this <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. མཁན་པོ] The abbot of a monastery or monastic college.">khempo</a>, the moment he comes in, he will try to appoint one <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. དགེ་སྐོས] The main disciplinary official in a monastic college (tratsang).">gegö</a> every year, but not for that year, probably for the next two or three years.   

**Q:**  Why?   

**A:**  Well, because, it's only that when he join in that the previous <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. མཁན་པོ] The abbot of a monastery or monastic college.">khempo</a> had already appointed one or two <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. དགེ་སྐོས] The main disciplinary official in a monastic college (tratsang).">gegö</a> already there.   

**Q:**  Really.   

**A:**  Yeah, that happens. So then the   

**Q:**  That <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. མཁན་པོ] The abbot of a monastery or monastic college.">khempo</a> would really have to check on that system.   

**A:**  Yes, and this <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. མཁན་པོ] The abbot of a monastery or monastic college.">khempo</a> get his chance to push it a little now.   

**Q:**  But the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. དགེ་སྐོས] The main disciplinary official in a monastic college (tratsang).">gegö</a> is only for one year.   

**A:**  One year.   

**Q:**  One year at a time but the umdze is like?   

**A:**  Lifetime.   

**Q:**  Lifetime, so theres not much opportunity for the dönsang kesang to go up?   

**A:**  No there are not. For they are not that well-known, and also its a small group who is really important, one of the most important ones, but they, sort of, people pay no attention about that.   

**Q:**  And they have separate teaching and   

**A:**  They have separate system.   

**Q:**  So how does somebody say, "I'm going to become dönsang-kesang."   

**A:**  Do whatever you want to do, start picking up yourself.   

**Q:**  Like at what age would people start separating out?   

**A:**  Oh, there's not even age limit, they will go anytime. Anytime. Five, I don't think the old ones change much but something like twentys and thirtys and teens too. So...somebody who had very nice voice or something, extraordinary, then, of course, the dönsang kesang will approach them and then umdze would approach them, even to the extent of <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. མཁན་པོ] The abbot of a monastery or monastic college.">khempo</a> will even approach...it may happen. But otherwise, most of them either if you have a friend in the dönsang kesang you go with them and you become dönsang kesang and I think they maintain a separate list also. Separate list also.   

**Q:**  Is there any advantages like special <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. འགྱེ] Alms given to monks.">gye</a> or anything like that?   

**A:**  No nothing. nothing. They have more problems. They have to meet separately more and practice much more than we have to meet and practice, much more.   

**Q:**  So, they're more concerned with the sounds than the words, what the words mean.   

**A:**  They're not concerned much with what words mean, they simply concerned with the sounds where to take high...and it has to be "thick" voice or "thin" voice or whether it is "oo" sound or "ee" sound or whatever...and how high should be, how low should be, that's what they do. That is there job, they have to memorize a lot, because you know in the monasteries the readings, they don't read books, everything have to come out by heart. And these are the people who are responsible because everyone will say one hundred different things. Someone saying yes this is right, and something wrong thing but the core group is there to (pick) up... They really   

**Q:**  You mean like at <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. མང་ཇ] The morning tea served to monks from all the monastic colleges at the main prayer assembly hall.">mangja</a>?   

**A:**  Yes, every meeting they have, every prayer they say they memorize and they have to come, they have to come. If they're not there, they really come, they are really ones who come to <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. གྲྭ་ཇ] The prayer session sponsored by the tratsang (college) at which tea was served to its monks who attended.">traja</a>, <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. མང་ཇ] The morning tea served to monks from all the monastic colleges at the main prayer assembly hall.">mangja</a>, they don't come much to the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཆོས་ར] The special grove (&quot;dharma grove&quot;) in monasteries where monks formally met to practice debating.">chöra</a>. The chöra is mostly the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. དགེ་ཤེས] An advanced degree earned by scholar monks.">geshe</a> and debating. But then they, the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. སྐུ་རིམ] A religious prayer service for monks.">kurim</a> [Tib. སྐུ་རིམ], they have to come. In the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཉིན་ཆོས] A mid-day study session in monasteries.">nyinchö</a>, they have the singing.   

**Q:**  The <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. སྐུ་རིམ] A religious prayer service for monks.">kurim</a> is what?   

**A:**  The <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. སྐུ་རིམ] A religious prayer service for monks.">kurim</a> is the evening chöra.   

**Q:**  Evening chöra. Why do they have to come there?   

**A:**  Oh, that is mostly praying, a lot of singing goes on, a tremendous amount of singing.   

**Q:**  Chanting?   

**A:**  Chanting, a tremendous amount of chanting.   

**Q:**  I see, so they have to come to that.   

**A:**  They really do, that is their core. And then some difficult, complicated chanting, maybe probably, see it only few of them chanting, nobody else.   

**Q:**  Do, like, does the teacher, does your <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. དགེ་རྒན] 1. Teacher in a school. 2. In monastic settings it also refers to an adult monk who acted as a guardian to a younger monk. In such cases, the younger monk typically lived in the gegen&#x27;s apartment (shag). In monasteries, however, it could also mean a real teacher, or the monk who served as the guarantor for a new monk.">gegen</a>, usually is he the one who says, "Why don't you do this?"   

**A:**  He can do, he can say it but sometimes the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. དགེ་རྒན] 1. Teacher in a school. 2. In monastic settings it also refers to an adult monk who acted as a guardian to a younger monk. In such cases, the younger monk typically lived in the gegen&#x27;s apartment (shag). In monasteries, however, it could also mean a real teacher, or the monk who served as the guarantor for a new monk.">gegen</a> happens to be dönsang kesang you will also follow that to that direction too, but that is not set at all. You move up and down. Changes tremendously.   

**Q:**  Now, how do you get into the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཚོགས་ཆེན] The main assembly hall of a monastery. The assembly hall for the monastery as a whole.">tsogchen</a> level or the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. གྲྭ་ཚང] A &quot;college&quot; within a monastery, for example, in Drepung Monastery there were four main tratsang: Gomang, Loseling, Deyang and Ngagpa. These tratsang were property owning corporate entities and included monks who were organized into residential dormitories called Khamtsen.">tratsang</a> level, I mean how does that work? You are in the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཁང་ཚན] A monastic residential unit in which monks from specific geographic areas lived. These were corporate entities with property and internal officials. Some large khamtsen had smaller subordinate units called mi tshan. Khamtsen were part of tratsang (colleges). For example, Hamdong Khamtsen was part of Gomang College in Drepung Monastery.">khamtsen</a>?   

**A:**  Umm, you are in the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཁང་ཚན] A monastic residential unit in which monks from specific geographic areas lived. These were corporate entities with property and internal officials. Some large khamtsen had smaller subordinate units called mi tshan. Khamtsen were part of tratsang (colleges). For example, Hamdong Khamtsen was part of Gomang College in Drepung Monastery.">khamtsen</a> and you took interest to the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. གྲྭ་ཚང] A &quot;college&quot; within a monastery, for example, in Drepung Monastery there were four main tratsang: Gomang, Loseling, Deyang and Ngagpa. These tratsang were property owning corporate entities and included monks who were organized into residential dormitories called Khamtsen.">tratsang</a> tunes, you (have) a friend in there and you start getting into it, and then you get into tratsang and then tratsang from there you also get into <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཚོགས་ཆེན] The main assembly hall of a monastery. The assembly hall for the monastery as a whole.">tsogchen</a>. Tsogchen called group too and tsogchen has a different tune, completely by itself. So you took interest in that.   

**Q:**  Do people ask you to come and join, is that what happens?   

**A:**  Some people do, some people do, they ask were going there, well why don't you come in? Try to see if you can memorize that and this and that, some people have interest, a personal interest to you.   

**Q:**  But there's no more   

**A:**  There's no more financial benefit.   

**Q:**  If you're in all three or if you're just in one.   

**A:**  There's nothing. There's not at all, absolutely no financial benefit. No exemption (from) anything.   

**Q:**  So just personal interest.   

**A:**  Just personal interest. And this is the hard one.   

**Q:**  So how many people, do you think, do that? There aren't many pechawa.   

**A:**  Pechawa a lot, right...I think dönsang kesang relatively not so much, I think about 40- fifty.   

**Q:**  In all of Drepung?   

**A:**  Probably, that's a very small group. But if its not there, you can not have it. That's that. So when it goes very low category, then <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. གྲྭ་ཚང] A &quot;college&quot; within a monastery, for example, in Drepung Monastery there were four main tratsang: Gomang, Loseling, Deyang and Ngagpa. These tratsang were property owning corporate entities and included monks who were organized into residential dormitories called Khamtsen.">tratsang</a> try to force some people, say you have to...they try to do it, but mostly   

**Q:**  Now, are the musicians like that too, the people who learn the instruments? Is that the same thing, you have to have them too?   

**A:**  Well, in the case of Drepung, they don't use any instrument at all. No.   

**Q:**  None?   

**A:**  None whatsoever.   

**Q:**  No <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. རྒྱ་གླིང] A clarinet type of wind instrument played by monks in religious services.">gyaling</a> [Tib. རྒྱ་གླིང] nothing?   

**A:**  No <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. རྒྱ་གླིང] A clarinet type of wind instrument played by monks in religious services.">gyaling</a>, no big horn, thungchen [Tib. དུང་ཆེན], nothing at all.   

**Q:**  Why?   

**A:**  That's just the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. བློ་གསལ་གླིང] One of the main colleges in Drepung Monastery.">Loseling</a> system.   

**Q:**  That's just <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. བློ་གསལ་གླིང] One of the main colleges in Drepung Monastery.">Loseling</a>, but not all of Drepung?   

**A:**  <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. སྒོ་མང] One of the large colleges in Drepung Monastery.">Gomang</a> too.   

**Q:**  <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. སྒོ་མང] One of the large colleges in Drepung Monastery.">Gomang</a> too.   

**A:**  <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. སྡེ་ཡངས] One of the colleges in Drepung Monastery.">Deyang</a> and Ngagba are the only two that use the instruments.   

**Q:**  I see, what about the other great monastic seats?   

**A:**  <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. སེ་ར་བྱེས] The Je College in Sera Monastery.">Sera Je</a> and <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. སྨད] The Mey College of Sera Monastery.">Mey</a>, I don't think they use it, no....Ganden, yes, Shartse, Changtse [Tib. ཤར་རྩེ་བྱང་རྩེ] they both do this.   

**Q:**  Is there any theoretical reason why that's true?   

**A:**  <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. བློ་གསལ་གླིང] One of the main colleges in Drepung Monastery.">Loseling</a> used to say we are a tshenyi <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. གྲྭ་ཚང] A &quot;college&quot; within a monastery, for example, in Drepung Monastery there were four main tratsang: Gomang, Loseling, Deyang and Ngagpa. These tratsang were property owning corporate entities and included monks who were organized into residential dormitories called Khamtsen.">tratsang</a>, and that's why. But on the other hand in the Loseling gönkhang [Tib. mgon kgang] [the chaple where the protective deities are kept] people do it that there, another set of gombo [Tib. མགོན་པོ་བ ] [monks doing prayers in the gönkhang] set up again, then they're learn instrument and <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. གཏོར་མ] A ritual offering made from tsamba and water.">torma</a> making everything. And uh   

**Q:**  But those would be (people) from Ngagpa [Tib. སྔགས་པ]?   

**A:**  No, a part of Loseling.   

**Q:**  A part of <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. བློ་གསལ་གླིང] One of the main colleges in Drepung Monastery.">Loseling</a>?   

**A:**  A part of Loseling.but its in a smaller chapel they are meeting; its not in general meetings they are meeting at all.   

**Q:**  And how are people picked for that?   

**A:**  Some people who from already having little knowledge of ritual here and there, some sort of one picks the other up and get into that category again. There is no set up pattern. Many of those monks you can't forget one thing is that they come from another monastery, so some of the already have pretraining and a little bit of knowledge, so that have interest to get into that.   

**Q:**  So then in your <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཚོམ་ཇ] The name of the khamtsen&#x27;s prayer assembly meetings at which tea was served.">tsomja</a> and those things, they'd never play instruments? What about the bell, do they have a bell [Tib. དྲིལ་བུ]?   

**A:**  No, no.   

**Q:**  Damaru, [the small hand drum]?   

**A:**  No.   

**Q:**  Nothing?   

**A:**  No, nothing. It was a site separate than usual where you may do it. But none whatsoever in general.   

**Q:**  So when, like the monks do like their own private prayers, they don't do it all?   

**A:**  They may.   

**Q:**  They may, because I saw monks always doing with the sound "ting ting"   

**A:**  Yes. But in Drepung, you can not.   

**Q:**  You can not?   

**A:**  You can not, you can not, but we <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. སྤྲུལ་སྐུ] An incarnate lama.">trüku</a>, we have to give, one of the exemption is you can play damaru all the time.   

**Q:**  Well, then, why do people use them, what's the difference between using them and not using them?   

**A:**  Ha. At certain level, you know, I mean, after you out from there and then you can use it.   

**Q:**  You mean its a higher level not to use it or to use it?   

**A:**  The higher level later, I mean later, this is the beginning of study, more for study rather than playing the instrument.   

**Q:**  So the higher you get, the more people use damaru?   

**A:**  Yes. But that's why you find a lot of <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. དགེ་ཤེས] An advanced degree earned by scholar monks.">geshe</a> who don't know how to use it damaru, you give them damaru and they do all sorts of funny things. They act like a monkey.   

**Q:**  Because they never even use it?   

**A:**  They never knew how to do it, they never had to, all of a sudden they've got it in hand and they don't know what to do and in damaru they go (sounds like a galloping horse)...   

**Q:**  Is that considered tantric, the drums and these?   

**A:**  Yes, it is part of.   

**Q:**  So those who go on to <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. རྒྱུད་སྟོད] The Upper Tantric Monastic College in Lhasa.">Gyüdö</a> and <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. རྒྱུད་སྨད] The Lower Tantric Monastic College in Lhasa.">Gyüme</a>, they have to do it?   

**A:**  Yes, they have to.   

**Q:**  And they use it in their prayers?   

**A:**  They use it.   

**Q:**  And they use the instruments too?   

**A:**  Yes, but different system.   

**Q:**  So, what is there, more prestige to being, whatever, I mean, let's say your the dönsang kesang on the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཚོགས་ཆེན] The main assembly hall of a monastery. The assembly hall for the monastery as a whole.">tsogchen</a> rather than <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཁང་ཚན] A monastic residential unit in which monks from specific geographic areas lived. These were corporate entities with property and internal officials. Some large khamtsen had smaller subordinate units called mi tshan. Khamtsen were part of tratsang (colleges). For example, Hamdong Khamtsen was part of Gomang College in Drepung Monastery.">khamtsen</a> level?   

**A:**  No, no.   

**Q:**  Nobody cares?   

**A:**  Nobody really cares but <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. གྲྭ་ཚང] A &quot;college&quot; within a monastery, for example, in Drepung Monastery there were four main tratsang: Gomang, Loseling, Deyang and Ngagpa. These tratsang were property owning corporate entities and included monks who were organized into residential dormitories called Khamtsen.">tratsang</a> dönsang kesang probably have little more prestige than anybody else...only advantage what they get is good seat. they have to be near umdze, no matter how junior you may be you be sitting there. Sort of they will "block", totally they will block, so I think maybe forty, fifty,...maybe a little underestimate it, they used to block a whole line in their room...quite a lot, quite a lot.

The household or family of a monk that consisted of multiple monks. 2. The apartment of a monk household.">shagtsang</a>. There is no sort of limit here with this sort of level you can call this shagtsang and on this sort of level like a millioniar, you don't have that limit, that has to be attained before it can be called shagtsang.   

**Q:**  So where will you get a bigger house? You can get a house, you have to go to <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. གྲྭ་ཚང] A &quot;college&quot; within a monastery, for example, in Drepung Monastery there were four main tratsang: Gomang, Loseling, Deyang and Ngagpa.

**A:**  [Tib. ཤག་ནང་བཤུག], means "Internally pass on the house." Though the houses belong to <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཁང་ཚན] A monastic residential unit in which monks from specific geographic areas lived. These were corporate entities with property and internal officials. Some large khamtsen had smaller subordinate units called mi tshan. Khamtsen were part of tratsang (colleges).

The apartment of a monk household.">shagtsang</a> tried to get it, and then you may pass on that too, or maybe some shagtsang will just be finished, no more left, and you try to get that, no matter whoever left, the last person of the shagtsang or from the khamtsen, thats how you get a bigger house.   

**Q:**  What do the monks call their own place, where they live?

**Q:**  And some are quite wealthy? Yes From Generation?

In monastic settings it also refers to an adult monk who acted as a guardian to a younger monk. In such cases, the younger monk typically lived in the gegen&#x27;s apartment (shag).

The household or family of a monk that consisted of multiple monks. 2. The apartment of a monk household.">shagtsang</a> whoever it is. His property automatically goes to the shagtsang, so he may have some another one, he accumulate a little more, he dies and his next one becomes head of shagtsang and then already there are members already in that.

**Q:**  But they won't take in like adults, they taking in younger kids and   

**A:**  They can take adults in. You can combine <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཤག་ཚང] 1. The household or family of a monk that consisted of multiple monks. 2. The apartment of a monk household.">shagtsang</a> together. They do, sometimes they do that.   

**Q:**  Then why would they do they, just for more power or   

**A:**  Whatever the reason, maybe some are neighbor or friends, you know they like to stay, spend time here and there, and they started staying there and so they say, okay, lets become one, so what. Monk is monk, they are so easy, happy go lucky too, they really don't calculate so much. They don't...Ok let us join together, maybe some <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཤག་ཚང] 1. The household or family of a monk that consisted of multiple monks. 2. The apartment of a monk household.">shagtsang</a> have business interest, some are outside and together. That's another thing and maybe two people have one good area, this side and that side and say well let's merge together. There are various reasons.   

**Q:**  And then within the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཤག་ཚང] 1. The household or family of a monk that consisted of multiple monks. 2. The apartment of a monk household.">shagtsang</a> they have to have some way to organize?   

**A:**  Within the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཤག་ཚང] 1. The household or family of a monk that consisted of multiple monks. 2. The apartment of a monk household.">shagtsang</a>, then I think it goes seniority. And efficiency of the individual. Whoever is more efficient. More justice. Go by the other one and uh, otherwise they clash, right, they break shagtsang, just like that.   

**Q:**  But then are there cases where like a younger person splits it but the older person doesn't want to give him much of the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཤག་ཚང] 1. The household or family of a monk that consisted of multiple monks. 2. The apartment of a monk household.">shagtsang</a>?   

**A:**  Oh, yes, they will leave <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཤག་ཚང] 1. The household or family of a monk that consisted of multiple monks. 2. The apartment of a monk household.">shagtsang</a> too, a number of people leave from this shagtsang and go to another shagtsang. Oh, yes there's a lot of that, then it totally depends on the senior people down there how much they want to give.   

**Q:**  The senior people in?   

**A:**  Inside the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཤག་ཚང] 1. The household or family of a monk that consisted of multiple monks. 2. The apartment of a monk household.">shagtsang</a>, if you come in as a beggar with nothing and you want to go another, they wont give you much. And if you come with a lot, you can demand too.   

**Q:**  Do cases go to the monastery to decide that?   

**A:**  I don't really think monastery decides much and this sort of becomes quite a big cases. May even go to the dewashung.   

**Q:**  If it is a big case...(overlap) do you know of any?   

**A:**  No, I don't recollect, but I think there are. <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཤག་ཚང] 1. The household or family of a monk that consisted of multiple monks. 2. The apartment of a monk household.">shagtsang</a> and all the big ones, they call them <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. སྐུ་ངོ] An honorific term of address for aristocratic officials. It is something like, &quot;Your Excellency.&quot;">kungö</a>, the senior ones are called kungö, sometimes there are two or three kungö.   

**Q:**  By the people in this <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཤག་ཚང] 1. The household or family of a monk that consisted of multiple monks. 2. The apartment of a monk household.">shagtsang</a> or everybody?   

**A:**  In the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཤག་ཚང] 1. The household or family of a monk that consisted of multiple monks. 2. The apartment of a monk household.">shagtsang</a>. And then you know, if the shagtsang is a big one, then it influences others and they also call them <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. སྐུ་ངོ] An honorific term of address for aristocratic officials. It is something like, &quot;Your Excellency.&quot;">kungö</a> too.   

**Q:**  No kidding.   

**A:**  Yes. Phara [Tib. ཕ་ར] Jiso is one example. In there, there are two <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. སྐུ་ངོ] An honorific term of address for aristocratic officials. It is something like, &quot;Your Excellency.&quot;">kungö</a>. Call them senior kungö dreba [Tib. བགྲེས་པ] and junior kungö shönba [Tib. གཞོན་པ].   

**Q:**  But they are not <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. སྐུ་དྲག] 1. A member of the lay aristocracy. 2. Title for government lay and monk officials. 3. A name occasionally used for the top leaders/officials in a monastery.">kudrak</a> or anything.   

**A:**  No, they are just shagtsang. But they call them kungö.   

**Q:**  So they would have a lot of rooms, a big house, and a lot of money?   

**A:**  Oh, they would have a lot of money. Then you know they have this, even this Phara Jiso, in order to not clash, and probably they are looking after the interests of different things, one would look after the interest of northern activity and southern activity business and then they are meeting among themselves and then they meet and decide and set up the policy, otherwise they are function independent. It is a, you can say, its almost a corporation type of deal.   

**Q:**  But it could also be that they have like relatives?   

**A:**  Oh, they have relatives, that both <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. སྐུ་ངོ] An honorific term of address for aristocratic officials. It is something like, &quot;Your Excellency.&quot;">kungö</a> have relatives, will join in and become junior things like <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. གྲྭ་ཚང] A &quot;college&quot; within a monastery, for example, in Drepung Monastery there were four main tratsang: Gomang, Loseling, Deyang and Ngagpa. These tratsang were property owning corporate entities and included monks who were organized into residential dormitories called Khamtsen.">tratsang</a> nyertsang and start coming up (in rank), I have seen it. So by that generation, there probably be four or five kungö...so that's what happens, so when there are more kungö and each one of the kungö will take a line and separate, and they're totally responsible-- each individual is responsible for his own line..however   

**Q:**  Oh really. You mean, there isn't like one person at the top who says, "yes," "no," "we shouldn't buy this," "we shouldn't sell this."   

**A:**  Yeah, but the person, one is very efficient they may respect, but even then they may decide the other way, this very often happen in the shagtsang.   

**Q:**  Who would [end of the tape]
