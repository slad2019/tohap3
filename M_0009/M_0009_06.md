**Q:**  How did they notify people when there is <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. འགྱེ] Alms given to monks.">gye</span>? and in the <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. ཚོགས་ཆེན] The main assembly hall of a monastery. The assembly hall for the monastery as a whole.">tsogchen</span> there is a boy says <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. ཆུ་སྐད] The stylized yelling of young monks from a monastic roof that announces to the monastic community that there will be a distribution of alms in the prayer assembly that day.">chuke</span> [Tib. ཆུ་སྐད]?   

**A:**  <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. ཚོགས] 1. A prayer assembly meeting in monasteries when all the monks come to an assembly hall and chant prayers together. 2. An offering made of tsamba, butter and dry cheese in the shape of a cone.">tsog</span> <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. ཆུ་སྐད] The stylized yelling of young monks from a monastic roof that announces to the monastic community that there will be a distribution of alms in the prayer assembly that day.">chuke</span>. One young boy used to go there and say ... I don't know how they select these chuke people in the tsogchen. Either the tsogchen jama has to make the arrangement or the <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. པར་ཁང་སྡེ་པ] The person in charge of the printing house in Drepung Monastery">parkhang depa</span> [Tib. པར་ཁང་སྡེ་པ] makes the arrangment. I think it falls to either one of them. Maybe it is the parkhang's duty to make arrangements or the jama. Someone has to be responsible to select the boy and makes sure the boy comes and that sort of thing and get hold of the boys. Have to find someone with a good voice able to shout every where.   

**Q:**  Every morning he does this?   

**A:**  Yes, every morning.   

**Q:**  He stands on top of <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. ཚོགས་ཆེན] The main assembly hall of a monastery. The assembly hall for the monastery as a whole.">tsogchen</span>?   

**A:**  He sits near the roof and then shouts out in the 4 directions starting from the east, then south then north. and then west.   

**Q:**  How did he shout?   

**A:**  Sound is like "hey hai" "hey" and he say "cho". That is supposed to be.   

**Q:**  When there is <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. འགྱེ] Alms given to monks.">gye</span> he says?   

**A:**  He says double, "Hey hey" "hey". A lot of people told me they used to say "phey phey", but some people say "cho".   

**Q:**  You were saying about how poorer monks could live on that. They get 4 big teas?   

**A:**  Yes. They get 4 big bowls of tea up there at <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. ཚོགས་ཆེན] The main assembly hall of a monastery. The assembly hall for the monastery as a whole.">tsogchen</span>, and maybe <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. ཐུག་པ] 1. A porridge or gruel-like soup typically made with tsamba, and if available, meat and cheese. 2. Noodle dishes in broth.">thukpa</span> up there too. Then followed by an hour later in <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. གྲྭ་ཚང] A &quot;college&quot; within a monastery, for example, in Drepung Monastery there were four main tratsang: Gomang, Loseling, Deyang and Ngagpa. These tratsang were property owning corporate entities and included monks who were organized into residential dormitories called Khamtsen.">tratsang</span> the 4 things will be repeat. That is called <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. གྲྭ་ཇ] The prayer session sponsored by the tratsang (college) at which tea was served to its monks who attended.">traja</span> [in tratsang]. Then 2 hours later the <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. ཁང་ཚན] A monastic residential unit in which monks from specific geographic areas lived. These were corporate entities with property and internal officials. Some large khamtsen had smaller subordinate units called mi tshan. Khamtsen were part of tratsang (colleges). For example, Hamdong Khamtsen was part of Gomang College in Drepung Monastery.">khamtsen</span> will repeat. It is called the tsomja. [Tib. འཚོམས་ཇ] tsom means big gathering.   

**Q:**  You were saying that only a couple of hundred monks will show up at one time.   

**A:**  Regularly, for the mangja. I dont think it was a couple of hundred. About 100 I think.   

**Q:**  The abbot has to come?   

**A:**  No No, only the shengo has to appear there. And <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. ཆབ་རིལ] The Chabril&#x27;s main work was overseeing serving the traja. He was also the servant of the gegö and khempo. It had a middle status of the types of lene. The chabril was also the one responsible for beating the gong at the tsog and chöra. The chabril got an extra share of gye in the tratsang.">chabril</span> and umdze, but no abbot or incarnate lamas will show up. Later Triu [Tib. ཏྲེ་ཧོར] <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. ཁང་ཚན] A monastic residential unit in which monks from specific geographic areas lived. These were corporate entities with property and internal officials. Some large khamtsen had smaller subordinate units called mi tshan. Khamtsen were part of tratsang (colleges). For example, Hamdong Khamtsen was part of Gomang College in Drepung Monastery.">khamtsen</span> made it compulsory that they have to go to the mangja. Ever since I joined, Triu has the compulsory. I know.   

**Q:**  That was since when.   

**A:**  Since I was there. Sometimes it was only the Triu Khambas who were there. No one else. At least the junior ones.   

**Q:**  If there is <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. འགྱེ] Alms given to monks.">gye</span>, more go?   

**A:**  If there is <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. འགྱེ] Alms given to monks.">gye</span>, then more will go. And if there is a big gye, then it is packed. [laughter] Then there is another thing. Outside the <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. མང་ཇ] The morning tea served to monks from all the monastic colleges at the main prayer assembly hall.">mangja</span>, there is a <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. སྐལ་ལེན] A special right allowing certain monks to take their share of alms outside of the prayer assembly hall. This privilege meant they did not have to attend the prayer session to get their alms.">kelen</span> [Tib. སྐལ་ལེན] to collect your share. People who couldn't come to the mangja, can go to the kelen to get their gye.   

**Q:**  Do you have to have a reason?   

**A:**  I think it started with the priviledged people. Then it sort of covered off some, maybe with 50% inside and 50% outside. Kelen doesn't have to wear robe, just shawls, <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. གཟན] The upper part of a monk&#x27;s dress.">sen</span> [Tib. གཟན]. They can go much later and leave earlier. Untill the <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. སྐལ་ལེན] A special right allowing certain monks to take their share of alms outside of the prayer assembly hall. This privilege meant they did not have to attend the prayer session to get their alms.">kelen</span> outside is finished, the monks in the <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. འདུ་ཁང] An assembly hall in a monastery.">dukhang</span> inside will not come out. They will not let them come out. But none of the incarnate lamas or <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. ཚོགས་ཆེན] The main assembly hall of a monastery. The assembly hall for the monastery as a whole.">tsogchen</span> trüku will go for kelen.   

**Q:**  They get separately?   

**A:**  Either you go inside or you do not go.   

**Q:**  But even if you do not go to the <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. སྐལ་ལེན] A special right allowing certain monks to take their share of alms outside of the prayer assembly hall. This privilege meant they did not have to attend the prayer session to get their alms.">kelen</span> you get your gye.   

**A:**  Yes, but if we go there we get one extra. We are going for that extra.   

**Q:**  What do you usually get. Grain? Do you get like a bag of grain?   

**A:**  No no, For grain you get a stamp. They put a stamp on a piece of paper and give it to you. Then you collect the stamps and give it to someone and they go to any <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. གཞིས་ཀ] A manorial estate.">shiga</span> and collect the grain from there.   

**Q:**  Shiga where?   

**A:**  From the <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. གྲྭ་ཚང] A &quot;college&quot; within a monastery, for example, in Drepung Monastery there were four main tratsang: Gomang, Loseling, Deyang and Ngagpa. These tratsang were property owning corporate entities and included monks who were organized into residential dormitories called Khamtsen.">tratsang</span> shiga.   

**Q:**  In Lhoka?   

**A:**  No not that far. For example, <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. བློ་གསལ་གླིང] One of the main colleges in Drepung Monastery.">Loseling</span> has a <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. གཞིས་ཀ] A manorial estate.">shiga</span> in Gyaritsel [Tib. རྒྱ་རི་ཚལ] or somewhere.   

**Q:**  So the grain doesn't come up?   

**A:**  No the grain doesn't come up. They only give you stamp.   

**Q:**  So how much would they give you at one time.   

**A:**  Everytime it is one khe. I dont think there is less than 1 khe.   

**Q:**  How many times a year would you get?   

**A:**  At least 4 times a year: on the great summer retreat, yarchö chemo [Tib. དབྱར་ཆོས་ཆེན་མོ], the great winter retreat, gunchö chemo, [Tib. དགུན་ཆོས་ཆེན་མོ], the great spring retreat, jichö chemo [Tib. དཔྱིད་ཆོས་ཆེནམོ], thr great autumn retreat, tönchö chemo [Tib. སྟོན་ཆོས་ཆེན་མོ]. Definitely have 4.   

**Q:**  chö is what?   

**A:**  It is for <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. ཆོས་ར] The special grove (&quot;dharma grove&quot;) in monasteries where monks formally met to practice debating.">chöra</span>. You know, summer chöra, Its very much like a semester type. Tratsang system works that way. There is a yarchö chemo, jichö chemo, günchö chemo and tönchö chemo. Each one of those chöra chemo will have grain phog.   

**Q:**  And that is like one khe.   

**A:**  One khe. Then in between yarchö, tönchö there are small chöra. They run for 15 days type of period. These I do not think carries any grain salary at all. One or two additions were there.   

**Q:**  But that is only if you are in the chöra. If you are a working monk you won't get?   

**A:**  Anybody will come back to collect it. They know when it is given. Anybody can come and get it. Whoever is there. Interesting thing is Nyare khamba. When there is a grain <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. ཕོགས] 1. Salary (for a job). 2. The salary-like payments in grain, etc., that monk&#x27;s receive from their monastery.">phog</span> tomorrow at <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. བློ་གསལ་གླིང] One of the main colleges in Drepung Monastery.">Loseling</span>, Nyare <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. ཁང་ཚན] A monastic residential unit in which monks from specific geographic areas lived. These were corporate entities with property and internal officials. Some large khamtsen had smaller subordinate units called mi tshan. Khamtsen were part of tratsang (colleges). For example, Hamdong Khamtsen was part of Gomang College in Drepung Monastery.">khamtsen</span> will know today and we will send a messenger to Ratö [Tib. ར་སྟོད]. So all the Ratö Nyare monks will be there tomorrow.   

**Q:**  What are the Nyare monks doing at Ratö?   

**A:**  Nyare has a Ratö Nyare, Ganden Nyare, and Drebung Nyare. The Rado Nyare and Drepung Nyare has a special relations. So all the Ratö Nyare monks are considered Drepung monks. In the eyes of the <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. བློ་གསལ་གླིང] One of the main colleges in Drepung Monastery.">Loseling</span> monks they come under Drepung Nyare.   

**Q:**  Ganden also?   

**A:**  No. In the eyes of the <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. བློ་གསལ་གླིང] One of the main colleges in Drepung Monastery.">Loseling</span> all the Ratö Nyare monks are Loseling Nyare monks. therefore, when there is <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. ཕོགས] 1. Salary (for a job). 2. The salary-like payments in grain, etc., that monk&#x27;s receive from their monastery.">phog</span>, drepung Nyare will send someone to Ratö in the evening and the whole night the Ratö monks will come up. And early morning they are there.   

**Q:**  But that is far?   

**A:**  It is below Nyethang [Tib. མཉེས་ཐང]. But they get there anyway.   

**Q:**  Nyare is the valley near Sera?   

**A:**  No, it is the <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. ཁང་ཚན] A monastic residential unit in which monks from specific geographic areas lived. These were corporate entities with property and internal officials. Some large khamtsen had smaller subordinate units called mi tshan. Khamtsen were part of tratsang (colleges). For example, Hamdong Khamtsen was part of Gomang College in Drepung Monastery.">khamtsen</span>'s name. It was established by a famous siddhi, drubchen Nyare something [Tib. གྲུབ་ཆེན་ཉག་རེ] ... I forgot his name.   

**Q:**  What does Nyare mean?   

**A:**  I dont know. I forgot.   

**Q:**  What other kinds of things do the monastery give in terms of <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. ཕོགས] 1. Salary (for a job). 2. The salary-like payments in grain, etc., that monk&#x27;s receive from their monastery.">phog</span>?   

**A:**  Gye, <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. ཕོགས] 1. Salary (for a job). 2. The salary-like payments in grain, etc., that monk&#x27;s receive from their monastery.">phog</span>, money. And then another interesting thing is that during the summer, during the break period, [change out] In Drepung, in <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. ཚོགས་ཆེན] The main assembly hall of a monastery. The assembly hall for the monastery as a whole.">tsogchen</span> used to get <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. རྩམ་པ] The traditional Tibetan staple food that consists of grain that is roasted (popped), usually in heated sand, and then ground into a flour.">tsamba</span> there. Everyday for about 20 days you get a <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. བྲེ] A unit of traditional volume measurement [a container] in Tibet, 20 of which typically equaled one khe or bo [also a container], although in some areas there were only 16 dre in one khe.">dre</span> of tsamba [20 dre   1 khe]. This was during the Rigtra [Tib. རིགས་གྲྭ] period.   

**Q:**  What is Rigtra?   

**A:**  Let me explain--Drepung had three administrative points: <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. བླ་སྤྱི] The highest administrative council in large monasteries, like Drepung. It consisted of the Abbots, the Tshogchen Umdze, the Shengo and the Jiso. In Drepung it also included ex-abbots.">Laji</span>, <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. རིགས་སྤྱི] The monastic committee that consisted of the six incumbent Drepung abbots. Ex-abbots and the abbot of Ngagpa College were excluded. It was responsible for doing the 18 day Rigdra Ceremony for which it had estates to provide the funding.">Riji</span> [Tib. རི་སྤྱི], and <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. སྤྱི་བསོ] The head managers/stewards of monasteries as a whole, especially the large Gelugpa monasteries like Sera and Drepung.">jiso</span>. The jiso might not have been really administrative, it might have been more economic source. Laji is all the abbots including the ex-abbots involved in laji. I think laji has 3 different levels. The big laji, laji chenpo [Tib. ཆེན་ཨོཔོ], small laji, laji chung chung [Tib. ཆུང་ཆུང] and all this. All the abbots and ex-abbots become the big laji. <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. ཞལ་ངོ] 1. A junior officer in the traditional Tibetan Army in charge of a unit (platoon) of 25 soldiers (same as dingpön). 2. The two head disciplinary officials for all of Drepung Monastery and for the Mönlam Prayer Festival.">Shengo</span>, <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. པར་ཁང་སྡེ་པ] The person in charge of the printing house in Drepung Monastery">parkhang depa</span>, tsomchen depa [Tib. ཚོམས་ཆེན་སྡེ་པ] .   

**Q:**  What is the parkhang deba?   

**A:**  He is the head of the Book Printing House Drepung Parkhang. There is also photrang deba [Tib. ཕོ་བྲང་སྡེ་པ]- he is in charge of Ganden Phodrang.   

**Q:**  He is the one in charge of relations with the government.   

**A:**  He is supposed to be but not really. Then there is the chökhang deba [Tib. མཆོད་ཁང་སྡེ་པ]. That is the in charge of the Drepung <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. ཚོགས་ཆེན] The main assembly hall of a monastery. The assembly hall for the monastery as a whole.">tsogchen</span>'s temples. There are two chökhang deba. One for the east temple, chökhang shar [Tib. ཤར] and one from the west temple, chökhang nub [Tib. ནུབ]. chökhang shar comes from <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. སྒོ་མང] One of the large colleges in Drepung Monastery.">Gomang</span> and chökhang nub from Loseling. All these are part of laji. I think they are in the small laji. The Parkhang, I think, also has two; one east and one west. <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. བླ་སྤྱི] The highest administrative council in large monasteries, like Drepung. It consisted of the Abbots, the Tshogchen Umdze, the Shengo and the Jiso. In Drepung it also included ex-abbots.">Laji</span> has lots of land and estates. Then the <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. རིགས་སྤྱི] The monastic committee that consisted of the six incumbent Drepung abbots. Ex-abbots and the abbot of Ngagpa College were excluded. It was responsible for doing the 18 day Rigdra Ceremony for which it had estates to provide the funding.">Riji</span>. Is only the 6 working abbots. The Riji consists only of them. The Riji and laji has lots of lands and estates. These are managed by the six abbots. So they have to hire people all the time. They get volunteers. They really do not pay you but they get volunteers all the time. So all the Riji money they say that the abbots have to even count them everyday and lock them and, because nobody else works for the Riji. Only themselves. So all the <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. རྩམ་པ] The traditional Tibetan staple food that consists of grain that is roasted (popped), usually in heated sand, and then ground into a flour.">tsamba</span> used to come [as phog] from the Riji during the Rigtra. Each one of the abbots is responsible for giving that distribution. It is a sort of his personal obligation to distribute a <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. བྲེ] A unit of traditional volume measurement [a container] in Tibet, 20 of which typically equaled one khe or bo [also a container], although in some areas there were only 16 dre in one khe.">dre</span> of tsamba to each member of Drepung. Every 6th years when the 6 abbots make turns.   

**Q:**  That money comes from the <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. རིགས་སྤྱི] The monastic committee that consisted of the six incumbent Drepung abbots. Ex-abbots and the abbot of Ngagpa College were excluded. It was responsible for doing the 18 day Rigdra Ceremony for which it had estates to provide the funding.">Riji</span>'s estates?   

**A:**  Ah. I think it does but sometimes they have to use their own personal money on top. The <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. རིགས་སྤྱི] The monastic committee that consisted of the six incumbent Drepung abbots. Ex-abbots and the abbot of Ngagpa College were excluded. It was responsible for doing the 18 day Rigdra Ceremony for which it had estates to provide the funding.">Riji</span> has estates and also does a lot of business. loan business. They give out loans and collect them. They do both money loans and grain.   

**Q:**  So who does that. It can't be the abbots?   

**A:**  Oh yes. The abbots will sit there and they will decide it. They will call so and so to come and help there, etc. Even the <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. རིགས་སྤྱི] The monastic committee that consisted of the six incumbent Drepung abbots. Ex-abbots and the abbot of Ngagpa College were excluded. It was responsible for doing the 18 day Rigdra Ceremony for which it had estates to provide the funding.">Riji</span> has lots of cases pending in Lhasa. So they have to hire someone to go there. Lots of disputes because there are a lot of disputes. They ask people to help and it looks like volunteerings but they give some gifts to the helpers so there is benefit as well.   

**Q:**  So there are the 4 times you get a <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. ཁལ] A traditional volume measurement used for measuring grain in traditional Tibetan society. Sizes of this unit varied somewhat, but the official government khe (called mkhar ru or bstan dzin mkha ru) weighed about 28-31 pounds for barley. It was used to convey the size of fields. For example, a field said to be 10 khe in size meant that 10 khe of seed could be sown on that field.">khe</span> of grain each and then you get 1 dre/ day at Rigtra for 20 days (==1 khe).   

**A:**  Then if you are a poor monk. I think that for Rigtra at the first day it is a little bit bigger than 1 <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. བྲེ] A unit of traditional volume measurement [a container] in Tibet, 20 of which typically equaled one khe or bo [also a container], although in some areas there were only 16 dre in one khe.">dre</span> like a bo and at the last day a little bit bigger.   

**Q:**  Bo is like a <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. ཁལ] A traditional volume measurement used for measuring grain in traditional Tibetan society. Sizes of this unit varied somewhat, but the official government khe (called mkhar ru or bstan dzin mkha ru) weighed about 28-31 pounds for barley. It was used to convey the size of fields. For example, a field said to be 10 khe in size meant that 10 khe of seed could be sown on that field.">khe</span>?   

**A:**  Yes. I have to make sure how much is the <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. རྩམ་པ] The traditional Tibetan staple food that consists of grain that is roasted (popped), usually in sand, and then ground into a flour.">tsampa</span> is. It is a little bit bigger than what is called tsabre [Tib. ཚ་བྲ]. At tsabre in the <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. ཚོགས་ཆེན] The main assembly hall of a monastery. The assembly hall for the monastery as a whole.">tsogchen</span>, they also get a <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. བྲེ] A unit of traditional volume measurement [a container] in Tibet, 20 of which typically equaled one khe or bo [also a container], although in some areas there were only 16 dre in one khe.">dre</span> of tsamba. I dont know why they get it. And then during the <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. དགའ་ལྡན་ལྔ་མཆོད] The holiday commemorating the death of Tsongkapa. It falls on the 25th of the 10th Tibetan lunar month.">Ganden Ngamjö</span> period they get one huge bread, fried one, called Tsagowra [Tib. ?] and the <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. ལྔ་མཆོད] The Ganden Ngamjö holiday commemorating the death of Tsongkapa. It falls on the 25th of the 10th Tibetan lunar month.">Ngamjö</span> brown sugar [Tib. བུ་རམ]. So if you are very poor and living in a very meagre way, it might be just managable from these. Maybe you would have to add up a little more here and there.   

**Q:**  But how would monks add it up?   

**A:**  Then you get all the <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. འགྱེ] Alms given to monks.">gye</span>, <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. ཕོགས] 1. Salary (for a job). 2. The salary-like payments in grain, etc., that monk&#x27;s receive from their monastery.">phog</span> and <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. སྐུ་ཡོན] Money paid to monks for performing rituals.">kuyön</span>, all there. Kuyön, I remember many times, <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. སྡེ་བ་གཞུང] The name of the traditional Tibetan government.">dewashung</span> used to pay lots of kuyön. Whenever dewashung has additional rituals, shabten [Tib. ཞབས་བརྟན] to do they give kuyön. And then you really have to be there. Otherwise you don't get the share.   

**Q:**  Some <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. གྲྭ་ཚང] A &quot;college&quot; within a monastery, for example, in Drepung Monastery there were four main tratsang: Gomang, Loseling, Deyang and Ngagpa. These tratsang were property owning corporate entities and included monks who were organized into residential dormitories called Khamtsen.">tratsang</span> are richer than others so if you are in one tratsang do you get more?   

**A:**  Yes. If <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. གྲྭ་ཚང] A &quot;college&quot; within a monastery, for example, in Drepung Monastery there were four main tratsang: Gomang, Loseling, Deyang and Ngagpa. These tratsang were property owning corporate entities and included monks who were organized into residential dormitories called Khamtsen.">tratsang</span> is richer you get more <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. ཕོགས] 1. Salary (for a job). 2. The salary-like payments in grain, etc., that monk&#x27;s receive from their monastery.">phog</span>, if it is poorer you get less phog.   

**Q:**  So which were the richest.

**A:**  A lot. Nyare Khamtsen is quite a well-to-do khamtsen. Almost 364 days they have the tsomja. Almost.

**A:**  Oh yes.   

**Q:**  And Nyare is rich because it has a lot of <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. གཞིས་ཀ] A manorial estate.">shiga</span>?   

**A:**  No, Nyare doesn't have a lot of shiga. It is rich because it has lot of buisness people connections.

**A:**  About 1,000.   

**Q:**  And how many people run it?   

**A:**  The tsondu.   

**Q:**  You mean a <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. ཚོགས་འདུ] 1. The general name for the various types of Tibetan government assemblies. 2. Any assembly, e.g., the assembly (meeting) of monks in a college.">tsondu</span> consisting of everybody?   

**A:**  No. The senior ones. There are seven elder ones.   

**Q:**  Called what?   

**A:**  {he didnt recall their name} Ok, how was this division done, let me go back to that. There are officials. Nyare has a very senior official called Jigen [Tib. སྤྱི་རྒན]. And then after that, a <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. ཁང་ཚན] A monastic residential unit in which monks from specific geographic areas lived.

In some monasteries, the nyerba was in charge of storerooms under the authority of a higher manager called a chandzö.">nyerba</span>. Then there are other staff that doesn't have much priviledges such as <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. ཇ་མ] The monk(s) in charge of a monastery&#x27;s kitchen.">jama</span> and all these. They are a different matter [i.e. of a different type]. But every monk has to be <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. གཉེར་པ] A steward or manager. In some monasteries, the nyerpa was in charge of storerooms under the authority of a higher manager called a chandzö.">nyerpa</span> or equivalent. Every year 4 monks will be transformed from the junior level to the senior level which is from <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. གཞོན་ཁྲལ] The work obligations all young monks have to do for the monastery (it literally means &quot;youth tax&quot;).">shöndre</span> to tsondu. The mark is they have to be nyerba. There are only 2 nyerpa in Nyare Khamtsen, so it is 2+2. 2 can escape without being the nyerba work. They become seniority but doesn't have to become nyerba and two have to be nyerba. How do you do that? They roll the names in the front of the protectors. Two will come out and they will be nyerba and the other two autonomatically will escape.   

**Q:**  Nyerba is for one year?   

**A:**  Yes. And the <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. གཉེར་པ] A steward or manager. In some monasteries, the nyerba was in charge of storerooms under the authority of a higher manager called a chandzö.">nyerba</span> also has some expenditures too, in addition to those of the <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. ཁང་ཚན] A monastic residential unit in which monks from specific geographic areas lived.

There is a little bit of additional expenses that you have to bear up by yourself. So where do you make that money? From the [Tara Temple in the Jokhang] Drölma Lhakhang [Tib. sgrl ma lha khang]. You know the Lhasa <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. གཙུག་ལག་ཁང] The famous temple in the center of Lhasa that also housed important government offices, like the Kashag. The Jokhang is part of this temple.">Tsuglagang</span>'s Drölma Lhakhang. It is belobged to Nyare khamtsen's. So Nyare khamtsen will give it to individual monks 4 months [must mean 3 months]. So all these people the 4 who are going to be transformed from the <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. གཞོན་ཁྲལ] The work obligations all young monks have to do for the monastery (it literally means &quot;youth tax&quot;).">shöndre</span> to tsondu. The year before that is to happen, they will have the Drölma Lhagang for 4 months. During that 4 month period, whatever the money that comes in goes to you.   

**Q:**  No kidding. That will be quite a lot of money. Particularly if you get there about New Years time since a lot of people come.   

**A:**  Well there are a lot of periods. Within a 4 month period there is always a particular festival occurring. Always there. So   

**Q:**  Then you have to go and sit there?   

**A:**  Yes or you can hire someone. And some people will say I am moving through it, but I do not want the Drölma Lhakhang and the <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. གཉེར་པ] A steward or manager. In some monasteries, the nyerba was in charge of storerooms under the authority of a higher manager called a chandzö.">nyerba</span>, Ill give it to you to do.   

**Q:**  So the other guy will get two?   

**A:**  No no, for example, they can give it to me, I got several times. They gave me Drölma Lhakhang. So whatever gifts you get you take and whatever liabilities there are you also get.   

**Q:**  So who would you give it to? To somebody else?   

**A:**  No we take it and send someone else. I got <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. གཉེར་པ] A steward or manager. In some monasteries, the nyerba was in charge of storerooms under the authority of a higher manager called a chandzö.">nyerba</span> like 4-5 times.   

**Q:**  Why would you do that? Just for no bother?   

**A:**  Just for no bother.   

**Q:**  And you have to worry about the fuels and everything?   

**A:**  Yes, everything collection you get and every expenditures you spend.   

**Q:**  Is that common to do that?   

**A:**  Yes, I believe so. You don't have to give it to <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. བླ་བྲང] 1. The property/wealth owning corporate entity of an incarnate lama. 2. The property/wealth owning corporate entity of the Panchen Lama.">labrang</span>, you can give it so your teacher, or anybody else.   

**Q:**  Only 4 every year. It goes by seniority.   

**A:**  Yes.   

**Q:**  Not by knowledge or anything?   

**A:**  Nothing, only by seniority. After that, then you are part of the tsondu. Then a year goes by and after the <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. སྤྱི་རྒན] A senior khamtsen official who ranks above the khamtsen gegen.">jigen</span>, then you become in the category of the 7 elders.   

**Q:**  I don't understand. After you become <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. སྤྱི་རྒན] A senior khamtsen official who ranks above the khamtsen gegen.">jigen</span>?   

**A:**  Jigen remains for quite a long time. When you are senior # 8 in the list you become a <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. སྤྱི་རྒན] A senior khamtsen official who ranks above the khamtsen gegen.">jigen</span>. If somebody dies before you (ahead of you in seniority) you can quit jigen and shift it up. But not before a year at least.   

**Q:**  So some of these people are <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. དགེ་ཤེས] An advanced degree earned by scholar monks.">geshe</span>, <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. དཔེ་ཆ་བ] A monk studying the monastic philosophical curriculum. A scholar monk.">pechawa</span> and so forth and some are not. It makes no difference?   

**A:**  Doesn't matter. That goes according to the seniority always.   

**Q:**  So some are not too intelligent.   

**A:**  It doesnt matter. They are senior. They are still <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. སྤྱི་རྒན] A senior khamtsen official who ranks above the khamtsen gegen.">jigen</span>. He can quit the jigen and make somebody ..... But the jigen doesn't really have much respobsility. You are beyond the abbot and khantsen gegen. You are respected.   

**Q:**  So how many people would be in the <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. ཚོགས་འདུ] 1. The general name for the various types of Tibetan government assemblies. 2. Any assembly, e.g., the assembly (meeting) of monks in a college.">tsondu</span> at any time? 50?   

**A:**  Maybe more.   

**Q:**  Could you as a <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. སྤྲུལ་སྐུ] An incarnate lama.">trüku</span> just go in?   

**A:**  We don't go anywhere. No, we don't go to the <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. ཚོགས་འདུ] 1. The general name for the various types of Tibetan government assemblies. 2. Any assembly, e.g., the assembly (meeting) of monks in a college.">tsongdu</span>, nowhere. So you really do not become too much in the decision making body. If you want to say something, you can call the tsongdu in. They come to you. [laughter]   

**Q:**  All of them come?   

**A:**  All come if you ask all. If you ask just the 7, they come.   

**Q:**  What are the 7 called?   

**A:**  They do have some sort of name, maybe like 7 seniors, gembadün [Tib. རྒན་པ་བདུན] or something. I forgot. The 1st 7 are important. I think they get a lot of priviledges too.   

**Q:**  So they manage all the estate of the <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. ཁང་ཚན] A monastic residential unit in which monks from specific geographic areas lived.

**Q:**  Always is once a week, once a day?   

**A:**  Whenever there is important business. The <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. སྤྱི་རྒན] A senior khamtsen official who ranks above the khamtsen gegen.">jigen</span> will inform that there is a meeting of the tsondu.   

**Q:**  Now all these monks are living there? Often I hear that of the 10,000 Drepung monks thousands are somewhere else.   

**A:**  Doesn't matter. Whoever is there.   

**Q:**  But somebody must be taking the organization leadership.   

**A:**  The <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. སྤྱི་རྒན] A senior khamtsen official who ranks above the khamtsen gegen.">jigen</span> is responsbile. He is supposed to be responsible.   

**Q:**  But if he is not strong, there must be some other way to do it.   

**A:**  If <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. སྤྱི་རྒན] A senior khamtsen official who ranks above the khamtsen gegen.">jigen</span> is not very capable then the <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. ཁང་ཚན་དགེ་རྒན] The head official of a khamtsen.">khamtsen gegen</span> will take it or <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. གཉེར་པ] A steward or manager.

Or there will be some respobsible monk who will tell jigen what to do it. There are a lot of ways how to do it. The jigen trusts somebody.   

**Q:**  What happens if the <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. སྤྱི་རྒན] A senior khamtsen official who ranks above the khamtsen gegen.">jigen</span> can't read?   

**A:**  Then the <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. སྤྱི་རྒན] A senior khamtsen official who ranks above the khamtsen gegen.">jigen</span> will have somebody else to do that. No problem. There are clerks and many others.

The property/wealth owning corporate entity of the Panchen Lama.">labrang</span> at all. Except, it is a lot more expenditures because during the New Years there has to be a lot of gifts to the nangsen. That is their priveledges.

Tratsang actually has two differen categories of managers, one is <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. ཕྱག་སྦུག] A manager (of estates and endowments) of a monastic college or monastic khamtsen.">chabu</span> and the other is bungdzö. Bungdzö are established later, during my period. They change. The chabu don't change.   

**Q:**  That's the 13th Dalai Lama's period when they beat the monks swith switches after the <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. བློ་གསལ་གླིང] One of the main colleges in Drepung Monastery.">Loseling</span> trouble?   

**A:**  Yes. But then every <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. གྲྭ་ཚང] A &quot;college&quot; within a monastery, for example, in Drepung Monastery there were four main tratsang: Gomang, Loseling, Deyang and Ngagpa. These tratsang were property owning corporate entities and included monks who were organized into residential dormitories called Khamtsen.">tratsang</span> has to have these. That means its easier for the government to deal with the tratsang since these managers are the ones who repsect <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. སྐུ་དྲག] 1. A member of the lay aristocracy. 2. Title for government lay and monk officials. 3. A name occasionally used for the top leaders/officials in a monastery.">kudrak</span>, and they are easier to talk to. The <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. ཕྱག་སྦུག] A manager (of estates and endowments) of a monastic college or monastic khamtsen.">chabu</span> are more vulnerable to and are easier to control. It is away the government can have more power in the monastery.   

**Q:**  So the chubu are much more powerful?   

**A:**  They are much more powerful than even the bungdzö.

**Q:**  Last start today. You were saying that all the <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. གྲྭ་ཚང] A &quot;college&quot; within a monastery, for example, in Drepung Monastery there were four main tratsang: Gomang, Loseling, Deyang and Ngagpa. These tratsang were property owning corporate entities and included monks who were organized into residential dormitories called Khamtsen.">tratsang</span> has a document, <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. ཡིག་ཆ] The tsenyi teaching materials used by a monastic college.">yigcha</span> [Tib. ཡིག་ཆ].   

**A:**  Oh yes.   

**Q:**  I don't understand this?   

**A:**  In the <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. མཚན་ཉིད] Buddhist dialectics. This is taught after the six-year curriculum called düdra.">tsenyi</span> <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. གྲྭ་ཚང] A &quot;college&quot; within a monastery, for example, in Drepung Monastery there were four main tratsang: Gomang, Loseling, Deyang and Ngagpa. These tratsang were property owning corporate entities and included monks who were organized into residential dormitories called Khamtsen.">tratsang</span>, the tratsang where the monks study tsenyi in Drepung or Sera and the Ganden wherever they go, basically, they are all Gelugpa, they will take the works of Tsongkhapa [Tib. ཙོང་ཁ་པ] Gyeltsab [Tib. རྒྱལ་ཚབ] and Khedrub [Tib. མཁས་གྲུབ]. these are sort of more authantic and important sort of over riding the others. However each tratsang will have their own <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. ཡིག་ཆ] The tsenyi teaching materials used by a monastic college.">yigcha</span>, it means the accepted theory. So that is no matter whatever any quotation or they have over riding the yigcha. You have to accept your yigcha and can not lose your yigcha. Your loyalty of accepting the yigcha is more important even than Tsongkhapa and somebody else. Normally, you don't find much, but in case say if you find contradiction between the Tsongkhapa's writing and your own yigcha writing, then you have to somehow protect the yigcha writing rather than the Tsongkhapa's writing. This is the normal system.   

**Q:**  Protect means you have to defend?   

**A:**  Yes. And also when you lose your <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. ཡིག་ཆ] The tsenyi teaching materials used by a monastic college.">yigcha</span>, somehow you lose your yigcha theoridacaly in the debate is considered more disgrace than t<span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. ཞྭ་མོ; ch. 戴帽] 1. A regular hat, cap. 2. A common political slang term (label) used for people who were classified as class enemies or reactionaries. It was used politically as, &quot;They put the hat on him,&quot; or &quot;They never took his hat off.&quot;">hat</span> of losing any other quotation. So this is sort of important for each tratsang. Earlier, <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. བློ་གསལ་གླིང] One of the main colleges in Drepung Monastery.">Loseling</span> has one yigcha, I am not very sure which one. Then in the middle level they have the Jayang Gawai Lodrö's [Tib. འཇམ་དབྱངས་དགའ་བའི་བློ་གྲོས] yigcha. Later it was changed to Panchen Sonam Tragpa's [Tib. པན་ཆེན་བསོད་ནམས་གྲགས་པ] and now it is changed to Panchen Sonam Tragpa. So by 1600 at the period of the 3rd Dalai Lama, Loseling accpted the yigcha of Panchen Sonam Tragpa. Even in the debate, if they say it is according to the Panchen Sonam Tragpa, the answerer person has to remove his hat over the head and bow down and just swallow it everything.   

**Q:**  I don't understand that.   

**A:**  During the debate, sometimes the answerer person had to take their <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. ཞྭ་མོ; ch. 戴帽] 1. A regular hat, cap. 2. A common political slang term (label) used for people who were classified as class enemies or reactionaries. It was used politically as, &quot;They put the hat on him,&quot; or &quot;They never took his hat off.&quot;">hat</span> off. I don't know you notice here or not when some one giving some quatations, the answerer person has to take his hat off and bow down a little bit which means he is quoting from the yigcha. That means you just have to accept it with all due respect. You can't say all due respect, you have to say with all respect I swallow it.   

**Q:**  So somebody actually wrote the <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. ཡིག་ཆ] The tsenyi teaching materials used by a monastic college.">yigcha</span>? Was it a whole book?   

**A:**  Oh my god! It is hundreds of books. On Pangya Paramita, Pharchin [Tib. ཕར་ཕྱིན] there are number of books and number of books on the middle path, uma [Tib. དབུ་མ] and on the vidaya miga, there are number of books and on the Yinaya, there are number of books. And each of these subject have their own commentary and they have their own subtile and problems where they worked out. I mean hundred will be exacturating, but for Pharchin there are 8 chapters and 8 different books and uma also has the similar. Altogether, there are about 2, 000 books.   

**Q:**  Those were books especially not written on philosophy?   

**A:**  They are written on philosophy by the authors which <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. བློ་གསལ་གླིང] One of the main colleges in Drepung Monastery.">Loseling</span> accepted it and Loseling shares with Ganden Shartse [Tib. ཤར་རྩེ] and they have the same yigcha. Similarly, <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. སེ་ར་བྱེས] The Je College in Sera Monastery.">Sera Je</span> shares with Ganden Changtse [Tib. བྱང་རྩེ] And <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. སེ་ར་སྨད] The Mey (Me) College of Sera Monastery.">Sera Mey</span> [Tib. སྨད] has separate yigcha. <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. སྡེ་ཡངས] One of the colleges in Drepung Monastery.">Deyang</span> has the 5th Dalai Lama's yigcha. That is the very important funny trick share. The 5th Dalai Lama had gone out of the way to blame the Jayang Chöje's [Tib. འཇམ་དབྱང་ཆོས་རྗེ] yigcha.   

**Q:**  Why?   

**A:**  I don't know why. I am still not clear to me why and I think he sort of collected all ... I have not seen his historical writing, but over heard all the time saying that Jayang Chöje's works whether there are 7 or 17 volumes, I don't even know. Probably, looks like 7 volumes, but lot of people say 17. I don't know. It has been totally collectd by the 5th Dalai Lama and burnt. And also the blocks were burnt too. So the Drepung old monks sort of prostrated to him and begged and finally he kept only one set of copy in Drepung <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. ཚོགས་ཆེན] The main assembly hall of a monastery. The assembly hall for the monastery as a whole.">tsogchen</span> under seal. Nobody can read it. I am sure it is still there now and I am determined to see to it. I wonder why, I have no idea. After that, his writings became <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. སྡེ་ཡངས] One of the colleges in Drepung Monastery.">Deyang</span> <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. ཡིག་ཆ] The tsenyi teaching materials used by a monastic college.">yigcha</span> because Jayang Chöje's yigcha are accepted by Deyang. Though he is the founder of Drepung, all Drepung doesn't accept his yigcha. After the banning of the Jayang Chöje's yigcha, the 5th Dalai Lama's yigcha was accepted by Deyang which is not that great anyway compared with <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. སྒོ་མང] One of the large colleges in Drepung Monastery.">Gomang</span> and Loseling. Gomang also has realier yigcha replaced by Jayang Shepa [Tib. འཇམ་དབྱངས་བཞད་པ] and later Gomang's yigcha accepted by Tashi Gomang [Tib. བཀྲ་ཤིཨོས་སྒོ་མང] in Amdo.   

**Q:**  So these differs in?   

**A:**  In theoridical points here and there not all the subjects. But all except the Tsongkhapa's. But the interpretation is different, there we come to the theoridical point of view. If we really make it, there will be sub-sects actually. Somehow they don't call it sub-sect. They satisfy by sending <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. ཡིག་ཆ] The tsenyi teaching materials used by a monastic college.">yigcha</span> instead of calling it sub-sects.   

**Q:**  How many are there?   

**A:**  The well known are <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. བློ་གསལ་གླིང] One of the main colleges in Drepung Monastery.">Loseling</span> has a <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. ཡིག་ཆ] The tsenyi teaching materials used by a monastic college.">yigcha</span> shared with Ganden Shartse which is the Panchen Sonam Tragpa and the <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. སེ་ར་བྱེས] The Je College in Sera Monastery.">Sera Je</span> has Jetsün Chökyi Gyentsen's [Tib. རྗེ་བཙུན་ཆོས་ཀྱི་རྒྱལ་མཚན] yigcha shared with Anden Changtse and <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. སེ་ར་སྨད] The Mey (Me) College of Sera Monastery.">Sera Mey</span> has the yigcha of Khedrub Tenpa Dargye [Tib. མཁས་གྲུབ་བསྟན་པ་དར་རྒྱས] and <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. སྡེ་ཡངས] One of the colleges in Drepung Monastery.">Deyang</span> has the 5th Dalai Lama's yigcha. <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. སྒོ་མང] One of the large colleges in Drepung Monastery.">Gomang</span> has Künkhyen Jayang Shepa's [Tib. ཀུན་མཁྱེན་འཇམ་དབྱངས་བཞད་པ] yigcha. I don't think Ngagpa has a yigcha because it is more and less rituals and not much academic study. Out of the three great monastery, there are five and then Tashilunpo, I have no idea. Maybe they have the Panchen Chökyi Gyentsen's [Tib. པན་ཆེན་ཆོས་ཀྱི་རྒྱལ་མཚན]. Ratö has it's all.   

**Q:**  Really?   

**A:**  Yes, every small monastery

**A:**  Yes it is their curricular line written for them and buy them for them.   

**Q:**  Did somebody write this 17 vollumes?   

**A:**  Yes.   

**Q:**  That's the issue. How would a <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. ཡིག་ཆ] The tsenyi teaching materials used by a monastic college.">yigcha</span> change?   

**A:**  Well, probably, they must have some important reason. I do not know how it would be changed. Take <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. བློ་གསལ་གླིང] One of the main colleges in Drepung Monastery.">Loseling</span>, how would have changed from Jayang Gawai Lodrö to .... could probably my guess probably Panchen Sonam Tragpa becoming outstanding teacher and he was teaching in Ganden as well as Drepung too going up and down. So probably it had been his own ideas and started saying it and he may not probably accepting the others large and gradually might have picked it up and probably could be. Lots of outstanding   

**Q:**  Who is the incarnation?   

**A:**  Panchen Sonam Tragpa was the previous incarnation of the Trüku Tragpa Gyentsen [Tib. གྲགས་པ་རྒྱལ་མཚན] who was known as the <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. སྤྲུལ་སྐུ] An incarnate lama.">trüku</span> of the Drepung's Simkhang Gong [Tib. གཟིམ་ཁང་གོང] and the Simkhang Wog [Tib. གཟིམ་ཁང་འོག]. That is the source of Dalai Lama and other ones.   

**Q:**  So he is the incarnation of the other one?   

**A:**  Yes, the previous incarnation of Simkhang Gong. Before it was acknowledged as Simkhang Gong.   

**Q:**  He was acknowleged as Simkhang Gong?   

**A:**  Not at Panchen Sonam Tragpa's period.   

**Q:**  The next one?   

**A:**  Next to Panchen Sonam Tragpa was somebody else and then it is Trüku Tragpa Gyentsen. I think that was the period.   

**Q:**  Is Simkhang Gong is still existence?   

**A:**  Ngari Rimpoche [Tib. mgna' ris rin po che] supposed to the <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. སྤྲུལ་སྐུ] An incarnate lama.">trüku</span> of Simkhang Gong and these two were the outstanding lamas in Drepung actally.   

**Q:**  Who?   

**A:**  Simkhang Gong and Simkhang Wog, the source of Drepung. That's why the 5th Dalai Lama gave so much power to Drepung when he became the ruler of the Tibet. Why Drepung had two outstanding lamas called upper and the lower; Simkhang Gong and Simkhang Wog, Simkhang Gong was Trüku Tragpa Gyentsen and Simkhang Wog was the Dalai Lama. This is important to Drepung's historical back ground.

**A:**  This might not be <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. གཞོན་ཁྲལ] The work obligations all young monks have to do for the monastery (it literally means &quot;youth tax&quot;).">shöndre</span> because <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. བླ་བྲང] 1.

**A:**  I don't know. There is a big family called Thamgag Simkhang [Tib. དན་འབག་གཟིམ་ཁང] and they also have a small deity and the Thambag oracle, kuten [Tib. སྐུ་རྟེན]. I think it belonged to Thamgag Simkhang.   

**Q:**  Kuten is what?   

**A:**  Somebody who comes to trance and they have a deity and a temple.   

**Q:**  You mentioned about two <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. ཆོས་གཤིས] A &quot;religious&quot; estate held by a monastery or lama.">chöshi</span> of Drepung near Lhasa, what are they?   

**A:**  Gyaritsel and Ngodrubding [Tib. དངོས་གྲུབ་ལྡིང]. Both are <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. བློ་གསལ་གླིང] One of the main colleges in Drepung Monastery.">Loseling</span> shiga.

**Q:**  Was it south or east? Towards Yarlung Tsangpo [Tib. ཡར་ལུང་གཙང་པོ] River?   

**A:**  It is at the west after Dongkar [Tib. གདོང་དཀར], the town at the west side of the mountain near Drepung and below Dongkar is Gyaritsel and Ngodrubding.   

**Q:**  It is quite close by?   

**A:**  Very close by. We used to go and ride horse and spend the whole day and come back. I think it is 15 minites drive from Drepung.   

**Q:**  Is there another one little bit further like in Phenpo [Tib. འཕན་པོ]?   

**A:**  Yes, I am sure. There was <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. བློ་གསལ་གླིང] One of the main colleges in Drepung Monastery.">Loseling</span> chöshi in Phenpo and there is also in Nyethang [Tib. མཉེས་ཐང].   

**Q:**  What was that called in Nyethang?   

**A:**  I think it is called Norbugang [Tib. ནོར་བུ་སྒང].   

**Q:**  We have the <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. གཞོན་ཁྲལ] The work obligations all young monks have to do for the monastery (it literally means &quot;youth tax&quot;).">shöndre</span> and then and these <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. ཐབ་གཡོག] Monks or laymen who work as servants/manual laborers in kitchens (normally monastic kitchens).">thabyog</span>. Do the thabyog come every morning or they sleep there?   

**A:**  For <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. ཚོགས་ཆེན] The main assembly hall of a monastery. The assembly hall for the monastery as a whole.">tsogchen</span>, <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. ཐབ་གཡོག] Monks or laymen who work as servants/manual laborers in kitchens (normally monastic kitchens).">thabyog</span> are responsible to make fire making sure if the water is boiling, the thabyog's duty is called tsakhol thönsum [Tib. ཚ་འཁོལ་ཐོན་གསུམ], the water must be boiled, they must serve hot, and the tea must be properly juiced out and not sort of wasted.   

**Q:**  They live in the monastery or just go home or almost live everyday?   

**A:**  I think they live home and come. There is no residence and they have wives and the children all these. But some <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. ཐབ་གཡོག] Monks or laymen who work as servants/manual laborers in kitchens (normally monastic kitchens).">thabyog</span> used to live in the little house called Dzomomra [Tib. མཛོ་མོ་ར], it is very close to Drepung on the other side of the river flow. This is little place from where they collect water. The place is called Trogpo Phari [Tib. གྲོག་པོ་ཕ་རི]. Some are living in Tashi Khangsar [Tib. བཀྲ་ཤིས] at the end of Drepung. Tashi Khangsar is not incluided in Drepung where women can stay there. And many of them go to Thambag which is not far away anyway.   

**Q:**  The <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. ཐབ་གཡོག] Monks or laymen who work as servants/manual laborers in kitchens (normally monastic kitchens).">thabyog</span> are also responsible for cleaning out the tea pots and kitchen and ?   

**A:**  Yes, <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. ཐབ་གཡོག] Monks or laymen who work as servants/manual laborers in kitchens (normally monastic kitchens).">thabyog</span> are responsible for mostly in the kitchen under the <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. ཇ་མ] The monk(s) in charge of a monastery&#x27;s kitchen.">jama</span>'s direction every thing including the bringing the fire wood.   

**Q:**  There must be lot of <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. ཐབ་གཡོག] Monks or laymen who work as servants/manual laborers in kitchens (normally monastic kitchens).">thabyog</span>?   

**A:**  I forgot the number like 24 or 46.   

**Q:**  They don't get salary?   

**A:**  They don't get salary at all. They get alot of benefit because they get lot of tea and butter, dry tea and butter and thukpa. But not only from the <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. ཚོགས་ཆེན] The main assembly hall of a monastery. The assembly hall for the monastery as a whole.">tsogchen</span> but also from the khamtsen.   

**Q:**  They are like lend outs?   

**A:**  They don't lend it out, but they come by themselves and hang around and handle the bigger thing in the <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. ཁང་ཚན] A monastic residential unit in which monks from specific geographic areas lived. These were corporate entities with property and internal officials. Some large khamtsen had smaller subordinate units called mi tshan. Khamtsen were part of tratsang (colleges). For example, Hamdong Khamtsen was part of Gomang College in Drepung Monastery.">khamtsen</span>, so the khamtsen has more sort of policy how to organize things and they come and led by themselves and say this is the better way to handle. And they get things from there and say thank you and go away. Thabyog are responsible to beat up the monks if the shengo decided to lash the monks out, the <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. ཐབ་གཡོག] Monks or laymen who work as servants/manual laborers in kitchens (normally monastic kitchens).">thabyog</span> would come and lash them out.   

**Q:**  The shengo is the <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. ཚོགས་ཆེན] The main assembly hall of a monastery. The assembly hall for the monastery as a whole.">tsogchen</span> shengo?   

**A:**  Yes.   

**Q:**  What about in the <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. ཁང་ཚན] A monastic residential unit in which monks from specific geographic areas lived. These were corporate entities with property and internal officials. Some large khamtsen had smaller subordinate units called mi tshan. Khamtsen were part of tratsang (colleges). For example, Hamdong Khamtsen was part of Gomang College in Drepung Monastery.">khamtsen</span>?   

**A:**  The <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. ཁང་ཚན] A monastic residential unit in which monks from specific geographic areas lived. These were corporate entities with property and internal officials. Some large khamtsen had smaller subordinate units called mi tshan. Khamtsen were part of tratsang (colleges). For example, Hamdong Khamtsen was part of Gomang College in Drepung Monastery.">khamtsen</span> normally don't lash people. I don't think it is allowed. I don't think even the <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. གྲྭ་ཚང] A &quot;college&quot; within a monastery, for example, in Drepung Monastery there were four main tratsang: Gomang, Loseling, Deyang and Ngagpa. These tratsang were property owning corporate entities and included monks who were organized into residential dormitories called Khamtsen.">tratsang</span> is allowed too lash out tough they do. They mostly beat by hitting on the back. That they do it in the khamtsen as well. I don't think they make them lay down and lash.   

**Q:**  They hit them with sticks?   

**A:**  Yes.   

**Q:**  Is it a thin stick?   

**A:**  Sometimes it is very thick stick.   

**Q:**  Was it like a cane?   

**A:**  Well, the wet willow branches not the thin ones, it is quite thick. Thicker than thumb or little more than that. No matter how much lashed out, the <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. ཐབ་གཡོག] Monks or laymen who work as servants/manual laborers in kitchens (normally monastic kitchens).">thabyog</span>'s rule is to collect them. They will have a bunch with all the leaves and they would throw on the ground with the sound "thro' which makes people feel afraid and they lash from both side and if they are lash 50 times each side hit 25 times from the right and left.   

**Q:**  Do they hit on the back?   

**A:**  No, on the bottom.   

**Q:**  You mean the buttoks [Tib. རྐུབ]?   

**A:**  Yes. They have a funny system, you know the <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. ཐབ་གཡོག] Monks or laymen who work as servants/manual laborers in kitchens (normally monastic kitchens).">thabyog</span> really know how to hit and the shengo will not come down and they come down few steps and say, "hit him hard" [Tib. ཚ་པོ་གཞུས]. Sometimes, you had 200 lashes, but nothing happened to the individual. The thabyog know what to do and if they don't want to hit properly, they make a huge sound but they hit on the other side on the ground rather than hitting on the buttok. If they hit with the tip of the branch, that is really awful. So they also hit with the other side. Unless few thabyog don't like you and have problem with you something to settle it, then they hit with the tip. Another worse thing what they do is sometimes they cut your nerves.   

**Q:**  With a knife?   

**A:**  No, no, they hit like 25 on the back of the thigh and 25 on the calf and they hit 2-5-6 in between. That makes you crippled.   

**Q:**  Whose dicision is that? Thabyog or the shengo?   

**A:**  It is <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. ཐབ་གཡོག] Monks or laymen who work as servants/manual laborers in kitchens (normally monastic kitchens).">thabyog</span>. Whatever shengo says, they won't, but sometimes the shengo try to influence the thabyog to do that. That's how it is.   

**Q:**  So they don't have to hit on the buttok then?   

**A:**  They really don't have to hit on the buttok. When they have to some body down, from the calf to the wift ? they can hit wherever they want to. That is the hitting area. And then it is the rule, they immediately has to pull the leg out, so the nerves doesn't shrink. The rule is supposed to pull out, but the <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. ཐབ་གཡོག] Monks or laymen who work as servants/manual laborers in kitchens (normally monastic kitchens).">thabyog</span> refused to pull out and then you get shrinked and become crippled .   

**Q:**  But they were mostly hitting over here?   

**A:**  While you are lying down, they hit anywhere by two of them, so   

**Q:**  They can hit here too?   

**A:**  They even hit on the calf.   

**Q:**  But only on the back side?   

**A:**  Because you are lying upside down.   

**Q:**  You are lying in the ground?   

**A:**  You know the stones in the Drepung courtyard and there is another triangular stone and you are supposed to lay on the triangular stone. They put yopu down the triangular stone. That is the mark.   

**Q:**  That is outside of the <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. འདུ་ཁང] An assembly hall in a monastery.">dukhang</span>?   

**A:**  It is on the stone floor in the courtyard outside?   

**Q:**  That's the power of the shengo?   

**A:**  Yes, that is how the shengo makes people afraid. [laughter]   

**Q:**  What would be an incident that makes somebody get a beating like that?   

**A:**  That is entirely the decision of the two shengo.   

**Q:**  They have to both agree or one can do?   

**A:**  Normally, they sort of agree, but if they don't agree each other, the one will say like 200 or something and when they count up to like 25 times, the other would come down and say that's enough. That's probably how they do. Otherwise, they supposed to agree each other. But as usual, like the Tibetan system, if one says something and the other keeps quite and just watch. When he thinks it is enough, he comes out and say that's enough.   

**Q:**  Do people try to bribe the shengo?   

**A:**  Oh yes.   

**Q:**  By saying please don't hit me hard and that?   

**A:**  Well, no. You bribe the <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. ཐབ་གཡོག] Monks or laymen who work as servants/manual laborers in kitchens (normally monastic kitchens).">thabyog</span> and that you have to. If you think you are going to get whipped tomorrow, tonight you have to prepare all the thabyog. Thabyog get alot of things from that.   

**Q:**  And the shengo too must, right?   

**A:**  Yes, shengo for months. They will say give me an answer [Tib. ལན་ཁྱེར་ཤོག་ཨ]. Then you can't go and give the answer. You have go to the house and give gift and you have to keep on going through somebody talking to him and every time, they carry gifts. Finally you get the date when you can really go up there. That takes months and your representative [end of tape].
