**Q:**  section skipped   

**A:**  I can't say that when I joined Drepung I (decided to) associate myself with Drepung. That is not correct. Actually, the moment they recognized me as a reincarnation of Tashi Namgyel [Tib. བཀྲ་ཤིས་རྣམ་རྒྱལ], I've already associated with Drepung even though I have not officially joined Drepung.   

**Q:**  Why don't you talk about yourself rather than talking about in general. How you came to be recogized in the monastery and anything you remember about that. How old were you then?   

**A:**  I was 4 years old when I was recognized (as an incarnation). My hope was to be recognized as Panchen Lama. [laughter] People were talking about it.   

**Q:**  When were you born?   

**A:**  The same year as the Panchen in 1939, the Hare Year. I mean, its not really my hope, I don't know, its just that people were talking about it. I do remember this and I do remember that the monks from Tashilunpo came to see me. People were also talking about me being Traya Kyamgön [Tib. བྲག་གཡབ་སྐྱབས་མགོན] and nobody was talking of me being Nyare Khentrü [Tib. ཉག་རེ་མཁན་སྤྲུལ] [laughter].   

**Q:**  What do you remember? What did the monks do? They came to your parents and then came to examine you? Did they do things like they did with the Dalai Lama, such as showing ritual equipment, et cetera.?   

**A:**  Yes, I do remember that when the Tashilunpo monks came they brought a lot of the Panchen Lama's equipment. They brought a rosary and I remember very clearly that I was not satisfied with that rosary. I was not happy with the rosary at all. And I was looking for some more different one, and I remember very clearly that I told the monk that this is not my rosary. So straightways it seems I was going to be associated somehow with Drepung either to be Traya Kyamgön. Most probably not going to be Panchen. It became quite close to be Nyare [a khamtsen in Drepung's Loseling Tratsang], where I am, too [he was finally recongnized as Nyare Trüku (incarnation)]. When I was visiting Kongbo [Tib. ཀོང་པོ] (Province) on my father's estate and climbing up one of those long stairs, on the top was Sitraba [Tib. བསེ་ཁྲབ་པ] Nyare's protector deity. I was really happy to see that protector, so that kind of really established me to Nyare and Drepung in some way. It was sort of in everybody's mind. People thought it must be Traya Kyamgön because it was a bigger name [lama], I guess. So anyway, I do remember thereafter, I was selected as the reincarnation of the former abbot of Gyutö [Upper Tantric College] Geshe Tashi Namgyal. So some of those monks are coming and my father was refusing to give me saying it may not be, because it is not a high rank incarnation and it may not be worth it, and this and that- that I remember. Then they decided to apply for a little higher rank for this incarnation, to be considered as a tsogchen trüku. But they had the idea that they were not going to get this unless my father used his influence or something. And I do remember very clearly that the late Jawtang [Tib. ལྕོག་སྟེང], the head of the Yigtsang Office [office in charge of monks and monastery related affairs in the traditional Tibetan government-it is a monk-official office] he was a friend of the family and a relation of ours, actually of the previous Demo Rimpoche's incarnation not this one, so Jawtang [one of the most famous monk-officials of his era] came and met me and met my father and then they called me in and said this is the one we are asking the promotion for. But Jawtang was saying that it is not at all possible to do this. Anyway, he was told to please keep it in mind.   

**Q:**  Jawtang is with which tratsang?   

**A:**  He is from Sera Mey [Tib. སྨད]. He was the Talama [Tib. ཏ་བླ་མ] of the Yigtsang. They talked and later I was informed that Jawtang said it was not possible.   

**Q:**  Whats the difference did it make if it was Tsogchen Trüku or not?   

**A:**  Oh, its a lot of difference.   

**Q:**  Which is the highest incarnation?   

**A:**  First are the Huthogthu, then the Trüku Namsum [Tib. སྤྲུལ་སྐུ་རྣམ་གསུམ]. There are only three of them.   

**Q:**  Who is that?   

**A:**  Wön Gyelsey [Tib. འོན་རྒྱལ་སྲས], Losempa [Tib. ལོ་སེམས་དཔའ] and Lelung Shepey Dorje [Tib. སླེ་ལུང་བཞད་པའི་རྡོ་རྗེ]. Cannot be be anywhere else. Known as the three incarnations of Tibet.   

**Q:**  These are from everywhere or just in Drepung?   

**A:**  All three are in Drepung. That is very important. Later, the Huthogthu became political power and started jumping on top, but earlier I think that the Trüku Namsum were the biggest trüku .   

**Q:**  Under that?   

**A:**  Under that is called Sumden Ngebö [Tib. གསུམ་གདན་སྔས་འབོལ] It means "three cushions and soft pillow and cushion. The cushion does not mean one to sit on, it is a plate on which they put meat. Nge is the back seat, Bö means cushion, but in the old system there was a cushion on the table on top of which a plate of meat was put.   

**Q:**  That was the in the tsogchen?   

**A:**  That was a government title or rank.   

**Q:**  Which lamas were those?   

**A:**  There were quite a number of them. You can count the Huthogthu in single trips and there were only three trüku namsum and maybe there are a 1-2 dozen of these Sumden Ngebö including all sects. They all enjoy the rank above the shape in terms of seating. The silön goes before Huthogthu and the sitsab goes below the Huthogthu and then trüku namsum. Then Sumden Ngebö. These are the bigger incarnations (trüku chekha [Tib. ཆེ་ཁག]). Then the next is our type of trüku which is called the "middle incarnations" (trüku dringkhag [Tib.འབྲིང་ཁག]). These are also known as tsogchen trüku. This means that all your ranks and priviledges are acknowledged in the tsogchen [the main assembly hall of the monastery].   

**Q:**  Acknowledge means?   

**A:**  You enjoy all the facilities in the tsogchen.   

**Q:**  What does this mean? What priveledges?   

**A:**  A lot. You dont have to go everyday, and there are a lot of exemptions. You can get extra money.   

**Q:**  Extra money how?   

**A:**  When they distrubute the gye/phog (alms/salary) to the monks   

**Q:**  What is gye?   

**A:**  Gye is when a special sponsor comes and gives money (alms) and the salary or phog comes from the monastery's endowment as well as collected from the shiga (estates). In gye, if monks get 1 sang, all the tsogchen trüku get 3 sang.   

**Q:**  All the tsogchen trüku?   

**A:**  Yes.   

**Q:**  What about the Huthogthu?   

**A:**  I think they get five. The Sumden Ngebö get four and the trüku namsum and Huthogthu probably get 5. Now these Sumden Ngebö are also known as Huthogthu, but there are inner (nang [Tib. ནང] Huthogthu Huthogthu) and outer, chi [Tib. ཕྱི] Huthogthu. I think this came from Mongol times. Outer Huthogthu were like Drigung Chetsang [Tib. འབྲི་གུང་ཆེ་ཚང] and Dorjedrag Rigdzin Chenmo, [Tib. རྡོ་རྗེ་བྲག་རིག་འཛིན་ཆེན་མོ]. They all were outer Huthogthu. So they can act as Huthogthu using an umbrella, etc. outside Lhasa. Thus, they were called outer Huthogthu.   

**Q:**  The rights of the Huthogthu are the umbrellas?   

**A:**  It isn't only the right to have an umbrella, there is bogjag [Tib. འབོག་ལྕག], [tiger or leopard skin patterned rug stuffed and hung on each sides of the door], banners, simgag [Tib. གཟིམ་འགག], monk bodyguards, palinquin, [Tib. ཕེབས་བྱམས] and a tottaly different Huthogthu costume on top of monk's robe; they wear kind like a yellow satin overcoat called Tagotse [Ch. da gua zi] and the monks shawl, sen [Tib. གཟན] has to be silk and a rosary of coral, and their shoes are rainbow designed, jachen [Tib. འཇ་ཆེན]. [laughter] The outter Huthogthu cannot wear the Huthogthu costume in Lhasa. At Tsogchen Huthogthu's phog is about same, but gye is more   

**Q:**  You tsogchen trüku get more gye/phog?   

**A:**  Not much extra phog which was almost the same, but we get extra gye.   

**Q:**  Sometimes, the gye comes from the endowment, right?   

**A:**  No. The moment it comes from the endowment, it becomes phog.   

**Q:**  I think on the Tsongjö, they give dayang and those?   

**A:**  They do.   

**Q:**  Was that gye or phog?   

**A:**  It is both. The gye, the moment it was belonged to the monastery and become part of their propfit for what year around, at the moment it comes out of that it becomes phog.   

**Q:**  So if I give the money to the monks it is gye and if I give it to the monastery as the endowment, then becomes phog, right?   

**A:**  Yes, it becomes phog afterwards in the next year.   

**Q:**  What is endowment called?   

**A:**  It is called matsa [Tib. མ་རྩ] or Chögyün Tongtsa [Tib. མཆོད་རྒྱུན་གཏོང་རྩ]. Also tsogchen trüku can ride and keep a horse inside Drepung. Even abbots cannot ride horse in monastery. Also can keep pets like cats and dogs, and flowers,there are a lot of such exemptions. There are 60 some exemptions. Every year when the new shengo comes, you have to give a trangga garpo for each exemption or permission.   

**Q:**  All tsogchen trüku do this?   

**A:**  Yes, all have to give this. You say, (this is for) permision for this, permission for that. Every year we have arguments because of [Tib. རྟ་དྲེའུ] ("horse and mule"). This word means horses and mules but some shengo insist horse is one trangga garpo and mule is a second trangga garpo, but we will argue that together they are one trangga garpo. Always argument over this. We can also have bells on the horse. We can ring bells and cymbals in our individual house without asking permission.   

**Q:**  Can't other monks do this?   

**Q:**  No they can't, unless they get special permission because it will disturb other monks. They may keep these in room but not play them there. We can also wear the Chinese type shoes called hai.   

**Q:**  You can wear boots, right?   

**A:**  Everybody can wear boots, but not this kind of shoes. And you can't go on the roof top without the sen, the monk's shawl and the others cannot. Even the abbots cannot ride horses in the monastery.   

**Q:**  But Drepung is really it is steep and hard to walk up and down.   

**A:**  We just keep on riding horse because it is a priviledge, but somtimes (there is) danger of falling from the horse. We can wear vest, tongga [Tib. གོས་ཆེན་སྟོད་འགག] made from multi-color brocade, we can always have servant wherever you go, even to tsog [prayer assembly] the monastery will provide a seat for the servant who sits behind in a separate row. Main row is in the front of pillar and servants sit behind. And in tratsang all tsogchen trüku have throne. In tsogchen you don't have throne, but you are allowed to sit higher than rest by having more cusions piled up. Only the inner Huthogthu have throne in tsogchen. Its a higher cushion piled up and the not throne You also can come in late to tsog and leave early.   

**Q:**  You were sure that the gegö can't beat you, right?   

**A:**  No one will beat you (for being naughty). Technically they can beat you, but nobody will. Some of the abbots will give us a hard time, if trüku misbehaved so badly, the abbot will come and talk to you. But they won't scream and shout and gegö doesn't come.   

**Q:**  When you go to the tsog, you can have your servants sitting behind you in the tsog?   

**A:**  Yes. This is in Drepung--in Mönlam tsog they can't sit behind you.   

**Q:**  So he would stay on the row or behind he row?   

**A:**  Behind the row in bewteen the pillars and their cushions were not so comfortable. The main row was in front of the pillars. Also you don't have to wear the cloak, dagam, [Tib. ཟླ་གམ], it can be carried by servants and you can have a geyog.   

**Q:**  The dagam, what is the meaning of that? Was that because it is heavy?   

**A:**  Well, in the tsog you have to wear dagam.   

**Q:**  Was the dagam the big thing made from wool inside?   

**A:**  Not that one, that was the one you wear in your room. In the tsog, they have a different dagam made from woven woolen materials which is also worn by the shengo. The color is different. Tsogchen trüku wear bright orange dagam but the monks wear maroon.   

**A:**  So you don't have to carry that, but you have to wear?   

**A:**  We wear it in the tsog and the servants put it on you as you enter the door and take it off as you leave. They pinch you too. Oh yes, I got pinched by servants all the time. They whisper when putting it on saying you better behave yourself and pinch me. [laughter]   

**Q:**  How did your incarnation line then end up becoming a tsogchen trüku? First Jogtang said it is not possoble, right? Then what happened?   

**A:**  I think Talungdra [the regent] helped. Talungdra was determined to get me through. For some religious reason that Phabongka [Tib. ཕ་བོང་ཁ] [one of the most famous Gelukpa incarnate lamas of his time] had asked him to look after it. Even Jogtang was surprised.   

**Q:**  The problem is that this have to go to the Yigtsang?   

**A:**  These tsogchen trüku ranks and above are governmental ranks and have to be applied, santioned and approved by the government.   

**Q:**  Does Jigyab khembo must have to approve it?   

**A:**  I don't think so. Goes straight from Yigtsang to the Regent. Its not necesaary to go through Jigyab khembo.   

**Q:**  Would the labrang make a petititon to the Yigtsang?   

**A:**  The labrang would a make a petition addressed to Regent through Yigtsang.   

**A:**  What would such a petition say? Do you say a reason or something?   

**A:**  Well, it would say something in general application, this young incarnate lama is so bright and wonderful and so forth so please promote him to tsogchen trüku rank for the benefit for the sentient beings and he may be given the rank. In my case the Regent gave the reason--I have seen the letter-- (he said) that since he is son of nephew of 13th Dalai Lama and member of the 13th Dalai Lama's family , and 13th is so great, so here is giving the rank. That was the reason the regent has used it.   

**Q:**  Your father was the nephew how? To the female or male?   

**A:**  I have no idea, but he is nephew for sure. In Lhasa, Shatra [Tib. བཤད་སྒྲ] and Horkhang [two elderly former aristocrats] will know although Langdün [Tib. གླང་མདུན] is not there now. That was the reason Taglungdra used it. I think Talama [Jogtang] was saying that there was no reason [to promote this incarnation line] so how can we do it, so Talungdra came up with this reason.   

**Q:**  It is ususally hard to become tsogchen trüku?   

**A:**  Yes, it is used to be very hard, but later in 1950's then they started giving lots of these promotions to incarnated lamas from Kham for political reasons because Kham is important. It was dharma politics. [laughter] These lamas were important politically so the [Tibetan] government used this to try to win their favor. For central Tibetan incarnations it was very hard to get, I was lucky to get it.   

**Q:**  And there were 60 exemptions for the tsogchen trüku?   

**A:**  Yes, there are a lot like something like 60. I do rememeber they collected 60 some trangga garpo for each one to the shengo every year. The shengo have sometimes have some kind of right called like cow dung tax, juchag [Tib. ལྕི་འཕྱགས] to collect all the cow dung from the villagers when they come to sell cow dung in the Drepung stone floor during special seasons and pay minimum rates but they can't take it from us if it is belonged to us. And there was also the market tax, tromchag [Tib. ཁྲོམ་འཕྱགས] collected anything from the market by the shengo in the Drepung stone floor. This is not all the time, it is just before the month of his tonggo at the beginning of autumn. But if something belong to us, they have to stop and identify and we can get it back. I remember very clearly once one shengo even had already poured the cow dung into his store, but I went and he had to put the dung back in the bag and I took it home. [laughter]   

**Q:**  How did the shengo come to have it?   

**A:**  Well some of the villagers belonging to us were carrying the cow dung below Drepung to Lhasa. He got from there. If some body is closed to you, you also go there and get it back. Then there are lot of tax exemptions and there were taxes for the tragyün like the shöndre, monk's taxes, tratre [Tib. གྲྭ་ཁྲལ] these are all exempted.   

**Q:**  All the Jedrung [Tib. རྗེ་དྲུང] are also exempted too?   

**Q:**  Not from the tsogchen taxes, but from the tratsang taxes. There were tratsang trüku and khamtsen trüku and the tratsang trüku are never exempted from the tsogchen taxes.   

**Q:**  What are the tsogchen taxes? Work?   

**A:**  There are a lot of things there.   

**Q:**  But the trüku don't do the work, right?.   

**A:**  They have to give a lot of tonggo.   

**Q:**  The tonggo is also a tax?   

**A:**  Tonggo is not a consistant tax.   

**Q:**  The other have to do the physical labor for the tratre and those things?   

**A:**  Yes.   

**Q:**  The tsogchen tax is mostly tonggo, right?   

**A:**  No, they would call monks and say you have to do this much, or tsogchen needs this to be done. And the tratsang have to send the monks.   

**Q:**  What kind of work?   

**A:**  Sometimes, cleaning and you have to do that or this.   

**Q:**  You yourself don't need to work and you can send people, right?   

**A:**  Yes. We don't have to send people. All these kind of taxes were exempted.   

**Q:**  This is because you were tsogchen trüku, right?   

**A:**  Yes.   

**Q:**  Some there trüku have to send somebody to work?   

**A:**  If you are just a tratsang trüku, then you would have to send somebody to do this work. You do not have to go physically, you have to produce the labor.   

**Q:**  I swear by the Three Jewels that this is really complicated. We can spend the whole year. This is so in detail and each question have many questions.
