<p><strong>A:</strong>  a lot of readings, readings would provide you for the doubts, you don&apos;t understand the meaning or you think its something wrong and the doubts are the basis for which you debate.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  You don&apos;t have to read things like Marpa&apos;s Biography [Tib. &#xF58;&#xF62;&#xF0B;&#xF54;&#xF60;&#xF72;&#xF0B;&#xF62;&#xFA3;&#xF58;&#xF0B;&#xF50;&#xF62;], or something?   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  No, no, no. This is the history of we don&apos;t read, the subject or whatever you are   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  Does anybody read those? In Tibet?   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  I&apos;m sure there are people who read them, these are the subject when you read in your leisure.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  Leisure.   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  Leisure, not in a   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  But like...did your <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. &#xF56;&#xFB3;&#xF0B;&#xF56;&#xFB2;&#xF44;] 1. The property/wealth owning corporate entity of an incarnate lama. 2. The property/wealth owning corporate entity of the Panchen Lama.">labrang</span> have like a library?   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  Oh, yea, it do. Yeah. Because it was meant for us only, not for public library.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  But the monastery doesn&apos;t have a library?   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  No.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  You have to get your own books somewhere.   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  Somewhere you get your own books, you get to read to borrow it around, books are borrowed a lot.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  Such an individual oriented system.   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  Yes, such an individual oriented.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  Everything&apos;s kind of individual, all of Buddhisms individual really.   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  Right.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  And everything is like that, that&apos;s kind of, people do whatever they want, like, how deep they want to go or   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  It is individual, how deep they want to go, there is no such thing.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  It&apos;s like nobody, see, here, in Jesuit monasteries and that everything&apos;s structured, you have to do this and this and this and this...study this.   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  And if you don&apos;t study, nobody says anything and you will be <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. &#xF63;&#xFA1;&#xF56;&#xF0B;&#xF63;&#xFA1;&#xF7C;&#xF56;] A mildly deviant type of fighting or &quot;punk&quot; monk who engaged in fighting and other unusual behaviors for monks in traditional Tibet&apos;s large monasteries.">dobdo</span> and roam round.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  Even if your not <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. &#xF63;&#xFA1;&#xF56;&#xF0B;&#xF63;&#xFA1;&#xF7C;&#xF56;] A mildly deviant type of fighting or &quot;punk&quot; monk who engaged in fighting and other unusual behaviors for monks in traditional Tibet&apos;s large monasteries.">dobdo</span>, there&apos;s no test or nothing.   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  Nothing.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  Now what about things like vows? Like, I&apos;m still mixed up about what we&apos;re talking about that, let&apos;s go back to when monks first come in. You said, that they don&apos;t have to take any vows, they just get in the monastery and their name is written.   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  Yes, yes.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  Then what happens, I mean, then, you know, can you never take the vow? Or do you have to take   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  You will take a vow, you will take vow, then nobody will stay there without vow because it is misuse of the monks privelege and you get a lot of non-virtoues, that&apos;s why nobody wants to do that. As soon as possible you take a vow.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  What would determine whether a person is going to take a vow or not, I mean, a monk, I don&apos;t understand anything.   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  What?   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  Like when would the teacher say, now you should take off the chuba?   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  Oh.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  I mean does he wait to see if the student is going to stay or?   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  No, no, no. The day when you shave your hair, wear your robe, you become parma rabchung [Tib. &#xF56;&#xF62;&#xF0B;&#xF58;&#xF0B;&#xF62;&#xF56;&#xF0B;&#xF56;&#xFB1;&#xF74;&#xF44;], that is the first step.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  But &quot;parma&quot; means middle.   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  Middle. Not really rabchung yet, but you are not lay. And you are parma rabchung   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  You&apos;re between then.   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  In between. From the parma rabchung you will join the gets&#xFC;l.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  Not genyen [Tib. &#xF51;&#xF42;&#xF7A;&#xF0B;&#xF56;&#xF66;&#xF99;&#xF7A;&#xF53;]?   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  Genyen is lay vow.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  Is lay vow, okay.   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  Gets&#xFC;l, and whether you fit to be <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. &#xF51;&#xF42;&#xF7A;&#xF0B;&#xF5A;&#xF74;&#xF63;] 1. The novice vows that Buddhist monks and nuns take. 2. A monk who has taken such vows.">gets&#xFC;l</span> or not, you have to be seven years, seven year old. And you be able to keep the crow out.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  What&apos;s that mean?   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  That means you can make enough noise to get crow scared.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  Really, I see, how do they say that in Tibetan?   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  Umm, [Tib. &#xF56;&#xFB1;&#xF0B;&#xF62;&#xF7C;&#xF42;&#xF0B;&#xF51;&#xF40;&#xFB2;&#xF7C;&#xF42;&#xF0B;&#xF53;&#xF74;&#xF66;&#xF0B;&#xF54;]. Seven years and you be able to keep the crows out. So then you are fit to be, age-wise, you&apos;re fit to be <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. &#xF51;&#xF42;&#xF7A;&#xF0B;&#xF5A;&#xF74;&#xF63;] 1. The novice vows that Buddhist monks and nuns take. 2. A monk who has taken such vows.">gets&#xFC;l</span> and then you go and ask whoever you want to get gets&#xFC;l, not necessarily from <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. &#xF58;&#xF41;&#xF53;&#xF0B;&#xF54;&#xF7C;] The abbot of a monastery or monastic college.">khempo</span>, very few people get from khempo, the abbot, and some will know lamas here and there or whatever. And then, whoever giving gets&#xFC;l, the poor monks, they can&apos;t arrange individual function so whoever doing something, right, something and you go there and become part of it.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  I see, part of somebody else&apos;s.   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  Part of somebody else&apos;s. You know, you know what happened, is some sponsors comes, a big rich lama or something who wants to become a <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. &#xF51;&#xF42;&#xF7A;&#xF0B;&#xF5A;&#xF74;&#xF63;] 1. The novice vows that Buddhist monks and nuns take. 2. A monk who has taken such vows.">gets&#xFC;l</span>, go and asked big lama, would you please make me gets&#xFC;l. He will say yes and then because major gift, he is going to do it, but at the same time, somebody is giving gets&#xFC;l vow and if everyone will say, can I take gets&#xFC;l, can I take gets&#xFC;l, you don&apos;t pay anything and maybe a hundred, maybe a thousand people taking gets&#xFC;l together. So that&apos;s how they act, you know.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  Isn&apos;t that interesting.   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  You become part of it and you become a gets&#xFC;l.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  And then what happens as the <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. &#xF51;&#xF42;&#xF7A;&#xF0B;&#xF5A;&#xF74;&#xF63;] 1. The novice vows that Buddhist monks and nuns take. 2. A monk who has taken such vows.">gets&#xFC;l</span>?   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  Oh, they give you a name, each individually.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  Like what happens, you come up, the lama is sitting on a throne.   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  Well, there are three of them, there&apos;s a complete ritual, three, three, three you have to go.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  Three, three?   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  Three, three, three you have to go.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  Students?   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  Yes, three, three, three in you want to go three by three. You have to repeat certain things.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  There&apos;s just one lama.   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  One lama, there&apos;s a group of monks, all the vows of Soso Tharba [Tib. &#xF66;&#xF7C;&#xF0B;&#xF66;&#xF7C;&#xF0B;&#xF50;&#xF62;&#xF0B;&#xF54;] is given by group of monks, sitting there, somebody will ask you whether you are, somebody is called, okay, now, there an appointment [Tib. &#xF51;&#xF74;&#xF66;&#xF0B;&#xF66;&#xF92;&#xF7C;] who gives you a time, there&apos;s a secret teacher who asks you secret questions. &quot;Have you killed a man?&quot; &quot;Have you did something&quot; &quot;Have you did that.&quot; &quot;Have you something,&quot; is always you say no.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  Like what?   </p>

Something sort of ritual, already set pattern, they will memorize, he repeat that. And then they set out and they say okay, [Tib. &#xF56;&#xF56;&#xF0B;&#xF63;&#xF42;&#xF66;].   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  How would they say in Tibetan?   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  [Tib. &#xF56;&#xF56;&#xF0B;&#xF63;&#xF42;&#xF66;&#xF0B;&#xF63;&#xF7A;&#xF42;&#xF66;&#xF0B;&#xF66;&#xF7C;], that&apos;s the language, part of it.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  This is just for the three or for everybody, waits till everbody is done or just for everybody?   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  He will be asking, the secret people will be asking three, three, three again. And maybe the assistant two three more, you know going on everywhere, you know, sort of pass out, going that corner and that corner, like that they go. So then he comes back and one of them turn and say okay, so then they, all of them will go...in there.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  Into where?   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  In the hall, wherever the hall is, somebody will be on the throne and two or three people are sitting there and then you see two or three prostation here, three prostation there, ten prostation here, ten prostation there. They will keep on detecting and giving instructions.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  In the hall?   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  In the hall, by one the person who is sitting ion the throne. Three here and ther three there and say so and so &quot;palapala palapala&apos;. (mumble).   </p>

<p><strong>A:</strong>  No, you know monks individual who is sitting there. Lots of chanting like sounds three or four times. Like that they do. They say a lot of prayer chanting and then three prostration here they will say a few rituals. Lot of prostrations would come and they also memorize prayers.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  Here...it&apos;s memorizing?   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  Memorize and sitting on the throne, also memorize everything, saying &quot;palapalapala&quot;, he will read through, say through, not read. And then ask &quot;did you see the non-virtues as non-virtues? [Tib. &#xF49;&#xF7A;&#xF66;&#xF0B;&#xF54;&#xF0B;&#xF63;&#xF0B;&#xF49;&#xF7A;&#xF66;&#xF0B;&#xF54;&#xF0B;&#xF58;&#xF50;&#xF7C;&#xF44;&#xF0B;&#xF44;&#xF58;] and you say &quot;yes seen&quot; [Tib. &#xF58;&#xF50;&#xF7C;&#xF44;&#xF0B;&#xF63;&#xF42;&#xF66;] and they say &quot;will you obey in the future&quot; [Tib. &#xF55;&#xFB1;&#xF72;&#xF53;&#xF0B;&#xF46;&#xF51;&#xF0B;&#xF63;&#xF7A;&#xF42;&#xF66;&#xF0B;&#xF54;&#xF62;&#xF0B;&#xF60;&#xF51;&#xF7C;&#xF58;&#xF66;&#xF0B;&#xF66;&#xF58;] and you say &quot;yes&quot; [Tib. &#xF60;&#xF51;&#xF7C;&#xF58;&#xF66;&#xF0B;&#xF63;&#xF42;&#xF66;]! and then they say &quot;okay&quot; [Tib. bab lags legs so&quot;. That&apos;s it.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  That&apos;s it, I mean he doesn&apos;t tell you what the vows are?   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  He already said it when memorizing &quot;palapalapala&quot;.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  Oh, I see, just so fast. So, that&apos;s just the three of them or is that everybody.   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  So after that, individually -- Yes, that&apos;s everybody - 500, everybody, then you go three by three, do that first, and you hold the (thing) together. They give you   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  Hold the what?   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  Hold begging bowl together. And so and so from now on you should eat out of this and behave this &quot;palapalapala&quot; some kind of ritual there. You repeat that again after that.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  I see, you repeat it.   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  You repeat it, and now from now on you are so and so and another three will come.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  And when do they give you the name?   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  Uh, about that time, they will give you.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  I mean, does lama have to make up all the names?   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  Probably, he had already made up the names and you know, or maybe there&apos;s some...the big thing they maybe printed and name written or something. They give you piece of paper, you got even name. Write it on piece of paper, they give it to you...All these there and when you become a <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. &#xF51;&#xF42;&#xF7A;&#xF0B;&#xF66;&#xFB3;&#xF7C;&#xF44;] A monk who has taken the full set of vows.">gelong</span>, the lama will give you the image of Buddha too.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  So it&apos;s ususally done by a lama, not the khempo.   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  Oh, whoever...is the <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. &#xF58;&#xF41;&#xF53;&#xF0B;&#xF54;&#xF7C;] The abbot of a monastery or monastic college.">khempo</span> of that.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  What do you mean?   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  Khempo is a technical name from Vinaya, whoever is heading that, that is the <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. &#xF58;&#xF41;&#xF53;&#xF0B;&#xF54;&#xF7C;] The abbot of a monastery or monastic college.">khempo</span>. I mean we are refering to the <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. &#xF42;&#xFB2;&#xFAD;&#xF0B;&#xF66;] A monastery that was considered a &quot;Monastic Seat.&quot; This usually referred to the three Gelugpa monastic seats in the Lhasa vicinity (Drepung, Sera and Ganden) and Tashilhunpo in Shigatse.">trasa</span> [Tib. &#xF42;&#xFB2;&#xFAD;&#xF0B;&#xF66;] [the three great monastic seats] khempo, that is the title khempo, that&apos;s two different things.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  Oh.   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  Khempo of <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. &#xF56;&#xFB3;&#xF7C;&#xF0B;&#xF42;&#xF66;&#xF63;&#xF0B;&#xF42;&#xFB3;&#xF72;&#xF44;] One of the main colleges in Drepung Monastery.">Loseling</span> is having the title of the Loseling Khempo might not necessarily be your <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. &#xF58;&#xF41;&#xF53;&#xF0B;&#xF54;&#xF7C;] The abbot of a monastery or monastic college.">khempo</span>. Maybe khempo of Loseling, I mean may not necessarily be your real vow khempo.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  Oh, I see, the one.   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  The one who giving you the vow.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  The one who give you the vow, you call him the khempo.   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  That&apos;s the real <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. &#xF58;&#xF41;&#xF53;&#xF0B;&#xF54;&#xF7C;] The abbot of a monastery or monastic college.">khempo</span>, the real khempo is one. It may be a lama, may be a <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. &#xF51;&#xF42;&#xF7A;&#xF0B;&#xF64;&#xF7A;&#xF66;] An advanced degree earned by scholar monks.">geshe</span>, may be anybody, may be, yeah.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  So how do you know what the vows are, when does somebody tell you what?   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  Well, that&apos;s that. Then you study your own, and now on your own.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  I see.   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  That&apos;s how you go.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  So again, its on your own.   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  Everything&apos;s your own.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  Your teacher must tell you, no?   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  Not necessarily...it comes more detail when you study Vinaya rules.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  But that&apos;s late.   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  It probably comes like eight, nine years later.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  Yeah.   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  Yeah, that&apos;s okay.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  What about the monks who never go and study?   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  Well, who never go to study, they will know sometime what they&apos;re not supposed to do. Somehow this knowledge is flowing around.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  Now are there many <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. &#xF51;&#xF42;&#xF7A;&#xF0B;&#xF66;&#xFB3;&#xF7C;&#xF44;] A monk who has taken the full set of vows.">gelong</span> who are not <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. &#xF51;&#xF54;&#xF7A;&#xF0B;&#xF46;&#xF0B;&#xF56;] A monk studying the monastic philosophical curriculum. A scholar monk.">pechawa</span>?   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  Oh yes, a lot.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  So being a <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. &#xF51;&#xF54;&#xF7A;&#xF0B;&#xF46;&#xF0B;&#xF56;] A monk studying the monastic philosophical curriculum. A scholar monk.">pechawa</span> and being a <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. &#xF51;&#xF42;&#xF7A;&#xF0B;&#xF66;&#xFB3;&#xF7C;&#xF44;] A monk who has taken the full set of vows.">gelong</span> are like separate? I mean you may be a gelong and not know anything.   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  Yes, possible, definately possible. Not only possible, yes, there are a lot of them.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  So when a student first comes it, like how does he, if you&apos;re not going to be a <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. &#xF51;&#xF54;&#xF7A;&#xF0B;&#xF46;&#xF0B;&#xF56;] A monk studying the monastic philosophical curriculum. A scholar monk.">pechawa</span>, then you&apos;ll never go into ch&#xF6;ra. It doesn&apos;t even matter.   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  It doesn&apos;t even matter.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  But you have to learn something, don&apos;t you have to learn to memorize the text?   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  You memorize a few here and there, may be, may be not.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  I saw little kids   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  Kudrak monks who had become, I think, what will they be like.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  Oh no, I mean   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  There was a monk, there is very similar monk like that lot of them do.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  Yea?   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  Yes, a lot of them.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  So why would they be monks?   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  Because they like to be monks.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  I saw little kids now in Tibet.   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  Even in Tibet, they have   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  In, outside they&apos;re always screaming rerererererere, memorizing.   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  Yes, they&apos;re memorizing.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  Is that the custom is the old days?   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  Yes.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  Yelling outside, outside the <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. &#xF47;&#xF7C;&#xF0B;&#xF41;&#xF44;] A most famous temple in Lhasa that houses a holy statue of the Buddha. It is often used to mean the Tsuglagang Temple of which it is a part.">Jokhang</span>, four or five of them.   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  They memorize the rituals, they say, the prayers they say, they memorize them... and they teach them, memorize, followed by meaning things like that.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  But, you could just, you mean to tell me, you could join the monastery and never learn to read that basically.   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  That&apos;s also there, that&apos;s also possible.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  But would most teachers, you know, try to insist that they read   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  Well, they will but some may not...or some teachers may insist, you may not listen to it, some teachers may beat you, some teachers may not.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  But is there any...but there isn&apos;t any feeling that being a monk is good in itself, right? That&apos;s the object...being a monk versus not being a monk.   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  That&apos;s right.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  Learning how to read and studying is not considered as important as being a monk?   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  I think so.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  You think so?   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  I think so.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  That&apos;s certainly what it seems like.   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  I&apos;m talking about general public view, yea, may be not.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  And the monk&apos;s view?   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  Monastery who cares, monastery really doesn&apos;t, I mean its supposed to be the duty of the <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. &#xF58;&#xF41;&#xF53;&#xF0B;&#xF54;&#xF7C;] The abbot of a monastery or monastic college.">khempo</span> is supposed to make sure everybody study, now, but totally different in India now, totally different, khempo really chase them around and a lot. But it Tibet, not. No. Total different in India now. Total different.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  People never talked about things like that, that, you know, there are a lot of monks who don&apos;t know anything...we should throw them out or something like that.   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  No, no, no. As long as you don&apos;t fuck any woman or stealing somebody and kill nobody...what right do anybody have to talk about throwing out a monk?. Nothing.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  That&apos;s very interesting. So then, some monks will start off as little boys, seven or eight, and maybe learn how to read and memorize a few prayers?   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  Yes.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  But they have to do something at <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. &#xF58;&#xF44;&#xF0B;&#xF47;] The morning tea served to monks from all the monastic colleges at the main prayer assembly hall.">mangja</span>, what do they do when they go to <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. &#xF42;&#xFB2;&#xFAD;&#xF0B;&#xF47;] The prayer session sponsored by the tratsang (college) at which tea was served to its monks who attended.">traja</span>?   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  Yes, they have to go there and say.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  They have to say something.   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  Yes, something, and some will have nothing to say, they sit there and   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  Oh, really.   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  There are a lot of them too.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  No kidding?   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  I&apos;m not kidding.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  I see.   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  Many of the <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. &#xF51;&#xF42;&#xF7A;&#xF0B;&#xF64;&#xF7A;&#xF66;] An advanced degree earned by scholar monks.">geshe</span>, very well-known geshe also might not have anything memorized either.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  Really?   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  Yes, and many of the <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. &#xF51;&#xF42;&#xF7A;&#xF0B;&#xF64;&#xF7A;&#xF66;] An advanced degree earned by scholar monks.">geshe</span> who will not even can&apos;t to write their name, too.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  But you can&apos;t take your book into <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. &#xF58;&#xF44;&#xF0B;&#xF47;] The morning tea served to monks from all the monastic colleges at the main prayer assembly hall.">mangja</span> or something like that?   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  No, no.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  You can&apos;t sit and read.   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  No. You can take your books only when you are learning from your teacher to the individual house.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  So then you go into this and so you are seven, eight, nine, then what happens to you? Then you have <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. &#xF42;&#xF5E;&#xF7C;&#xF53;&#xF0B;&#xF41;&#xFB2;&#xF63;] The work obligations all young monks have to do for the monastery (it literally means &quot;youth tax&quot;).">sh&#xF6;ndre</span>?   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  Then you begin to .... <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. &#xF42;&#xF5E;&#xF7C;&#xF53;&#xF0B;&#xF41;&#xFB2;&#xF63;] The work obligations all young monks have to do for the monastery (it literally means &quot;youth tax&quot;).">sh&#xF6;ndre</span> is another point, now the educational point is, you begin to memorize things and then you begin, first they teach the reading, how to read, and then be able to read faster, read good and read properly. That means, you know, this is called [Tib. &#xF61;&#xF72;&#xF42;&#xF0B;&#xF62;&#xFA9;&#xF0B;&#xF5A;&#xF74;&#xF42;&#xF66;&#xF0B;&#xF54;], they&apos;ll make sure that you really can grab on the reading, they really emphasize that so much and they will give you good training of how to read, how to read faster yet with picking at all the meanings and that they will give you very good.... After that, you are almost on your own. Whatever you want to study, whatever you want to do, just memorize, and don&apos;t do much study, and join in the d&#xF6;nsang kesang [Tib. &#xF60;&#xF51;&#xF7C;&#xF53;&#xF0B;&#xF56;&#xF5F;&#xF44;&#xF0B;&#xF66;&#xF90;&#xF51;&#xF0B;&#xF56;&#xF5F;&#xF44;] [the group of having good voice and chanting] And study learning the tunes, you can do that and you can study, memorizing and then go, study, looking into the real text books and being of interested on the debate, yes, you can do that.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  Well, what about the, you know, the things like playing instruments. Is that your choice or does somebody just say that   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  Playing instruments in <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. &#xF56;&#xFB3;&#xF7C;&#xF0B;&#xF42;&#xF66;&#xF63;&#xF0B;&#xF42;&#xFB3;&#xF72;&#xF44;] One of the main colleges in Drepung Monastery.">Loseling</span>, we don&apos;t have.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  Oh, that&apos;s right...   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  Yea, but those who have, yes, they can do it too. Your choice...you say, I like to do that, it is okay. And you have to go to the right person who can give you, you have to, whatever you want to do, you have to make sure that you go to the right person. If you don&apos;t know the right person, you ask your <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. &#xF51;&#xF42;&#xF7A;&#xF0B;&#xF62;&#xF92;&#xF53;] 1. Teacher in a school. 2. In monastic settings it also refers to an adult monk who acted as a guardian to a younger monk. In such cases, the younger monk typically lived in the gegen&apos;s apartment (shag). In monasteries, however, it could also mean a real teacher, or the monk who served as the guarantor for a new monk.">gegen</span>. I&apos;d like to enter into that and who is the right person to report? Normally, so and so is the right person to report and you go and report that gegen. Then that become your gegen again, real true, there are so many gegen too. If you want to study properly and you choose own gegen then you follow that. If you two or three or ten gegen. There is no organized manner to make you do this or make you do that. There is none.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  And when you take teachings from somebody then you&apos;re supposed to have special respect for them &apos;cause he&apos;s your teacher?   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  Yes, of course you gain respect automatically, you gain respect, but you don&apos;t, not necessary to pay. I mean its nothing.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  I mean show respect for him?   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  You show respect.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  You were saying how somebody would that Phabongkha [Tib. &#xF55;&#xF0B;&#xF56;&#xF7C;&#xF44;&#xF0B;&#xF41;] was trying to convince somebody to do something and they all said &quot;We&apos;re your disciple, we jump in the river if you say, but we won&apos;t do   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  But that is different, that is different. That is a dharma teaching, kach&#xF6; [Tib. &#xF56;&#xF40;&#xF60;&#xF0B;&#xF46;&#xF7C;&#xF66;] are totally different category again. Lama who give the kach&#xF6; are different category again. The teachers who teach you all the meaings and things like that, they are not people who give you the kach&#xF6;.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  Kach&#xF6; is the?   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  Kach&#xF6; is like you know, big teachings like the &quot;Stage of Paths&quot; Lamrim [Tib. &#xF63;&#xF58;&#xF0B;&#xF62;&#xF72;&#xF58;] on this initiation, that initiation and all this and that, that is the biggest skill, the highest skill. And umm, that is non-monk, lays are also included in it, not necessarily observed for the monks. And there is lay people and everything together, that&apos;s another total system, separately in conjunction with the monastery.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  Those are not in the monastery itself?   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  It can be.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  But not necessarily?   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  Not necessarily.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  I see, so that&apos;s another thing, and those are usually done by lamas?   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  Usually done by well known lamas. Lamas of that type, good ones, it also not started by big way, it started by 10-20-30-40-100-200 something, thousand something like that it go.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  That&apos;s good.   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  ...house, right, water is free, no electricity charge, nothing and they except that you buy cow dung and some vegetable and some meat here and there and that you can go every morning in the stone floor, dobjel [Tib. &#xF62;&#xFA1;&#xF7C;&#xF0B;&#xF42;&#xF45;&#xF63;].   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  The dobjel is what?   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  The dobjel is outside the Drepung where they come every morning things to sell.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  Oh, yea, there&apos;s still people, outside restaurant, people selling stuff.   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  Now they have restaurants because at that time there are no restaurants.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  Its cause all the people are coming for the pilgrimage.   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  Oh, now you have that there.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  Yeah, little guys, you know with, they have like little carts, little boxes and they sell <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. 1. &#xF46;&#xF44;, 2. &#xF56;&#xFB1;&#xF44;] 1.

<p><strong>Q:</strong>  Dopjel is what they call it.   </p>

<p><strong>A:</strong>  Normal rule, somehow, there&apos;s no room, there&apos;s no place, there is shortage of everything, so you don&apos;t want to set up [something] big there, so you want somebody who is efficient enough to do something, rather than having too many un-efficient people.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  I see.   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  So, I don&apos;t think you&apos;d pick an ordinary <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. &#xF58;&#xF72;&#xF0B;&#xF66;&#xF7A;&#xF62;] A term that can mean serf/bound subject as well as citizen, depending on context.

<p><strong>Q:</strong>  Well, anyway that&apos;s something, that&apos;s, you know, that&apos;s one of the kind of things that we have to ask a specific person, like some kudrak. Its not true villagers, I don&apos;t think, I &apos;m pretty sure that villagers don&apos;t get anything, they have no rights.   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  No, no. Maybe the family gives.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  The family may volunteer to give but I don&apos;t think they can say, you know, I want my kela, I don&apos;t think so.   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  I don&apos;t think the <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. &#xF66;&#xF90;&#xF74;&#xF0B;&#xF51;&#xFB2;&#xF42;] 1. A member of the lay aristocracy. 2.

<p><strong>Q:</strong>  It was Ph&#xFC;nkhang, wasn&apos;t it, yeah.   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  That&apos;s why, Ph&#xFC;nkhang shape lost his rank and office, so that was that.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  Okay, well, I mean that&apos;s no hurry, that&apos;s easy to find out, that&apos;s easy... .   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  Now, can you explain, like the <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. &#xF46;&#xF7C;&#xF66;&#xF0B;&#xF62;] The special grove (&quot;dharma grove&quot;) in monasteries where monks formally met to practice debating.">ch&#xF6;ra</span> business?   </p>

<p><strong>Q:</strong>  I see. Because the word is retreat, you&apos;d think they&apos;re going somewhere, that&apos;s, not.   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  Yarney is you are taking the summer promise, [Tib. &#xF51;&#xF56;&#xFB1;&#xF62;&#xF0B;&#xF41;&#xF66;&#xF0B;&#xF63;&#xF7A;&#xF53;&#xF0B;&#xF54;] which means not going to break and smashed out the fresh greens, green grass and green leaves here and that is what the main thing is.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  Oh, I see, so it is not the   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  In the western translating, they call that summer retreat, I don&apos;t know why but I think its something to do with the influence from Thailand...some where a translator   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  So it&apos;s not a retreat, its really   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  It&apos;s a commitment to   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  Commitment not to kill anything?   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  Commitment not to kill the living trees. Yarney, it&apos;s a promise not to damage the green growing.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  Not to damage the grain   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  Not the grain, the green.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  The green, I see, and you do that by not leaving the monastery?   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  Then there are some functions there, and I forget, what is it, now, I totally forgot, you have to get back within 24 hours in the monastery or something you have to do. Something...or they, you get blessed summer commitment and you can go away but you have to get back within the seven days. Almost like a retreat, they have some kind of boundary, you don&apos;t go out of the boundary, if you want to go out of the boundary you have to be blessed to go. Some small rituals you have to do and then you go out of boundary and you have to get back within certain period, I forgot, period, whether it is seven days or 24 hours, I forgot.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  And you are blessed by who, by the abbot?   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  Oh, by anybody.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  And then after the yarney?   </p>

These tratsang were property owning corporate entities and included monks who were organized into residential dormitories called Khamtsen.">tratsang</span> &apos;s traja, in ch&#xF6;ra.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  Oh, really.   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  During the ch&#xF6;ntsam you don&apos;t have traja.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  Oh, I see. Oh, so its hard for monks then.   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  Yes, its harder, but there be lesser monk in the monastery also during the ch&#xF6;ntsam.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  Yeah, but those who stay   </p>

<p><strong>Q:</strong>  So it&apos;s hard when they&apos;ve got to have more income.   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  During the ch&#xF6;ntsam its much more difficult for those poor monks for living.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  But that&apos;s like seven months of the year, almost because its only four months of ch&#xF6;ra. Maybe one more month of small one, that&apos;s five.   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  No, ch&#xF6;ntsam is much less, I&apos;m missing some few <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. &#xF46;&#xF7C;&#xF66;&#xF0B;&#xF62;] The special grove (&quot;dharma grove&quot;) in monasteries where monks formally met to practice debating.">ch&#xF6;ra</span> here.

<p><strong>A:</strong>  Oh, yeah, little chart.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  A little chart and how long they are, but you think, how many months of ch&#xF6;ntsam? Out of the year?   </p>

<p><strong>A:</strong>  During the ch&#xF6;ra.   </p>

<p><strong>A:</strong>  When ch&#xF6;ntsam there&apos;s nothing.   </p>

<p><strong>Q:</strong>  Sangphu Yarch&#xF6; is?   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  Sangphu Yarch&#xF6;, all the monks call it Sangphu, in that village and there&apos;s Yarch&#xF6;, the summer <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. &#xF46;&#xF7C;&#xF66;&#xF0B;&#xF62;] The special grove (&quot;dharma grove&quot;) in monasteries where monks formally met to practice debating.">ch&#xF6;ra</span> and in Drepung it is the ch&#xF6;ntsam period, but even then, not so many people go for Sangphu Yarch&#xF6;, however there is monks from Ganden comes a lot because Ganden Shartse is one of the ten ling [Tib. &#xF42;&#xFB3;&#xF72;&#xF44;] of Sangphu called Sangphu Lingkhagju, [Tib. &#xF42;&#xF66;&#xF44;&#xF0B;&#xF55;&#xF74;&#xF0B;&#xF42;&#xFB3;&#xF72;&#xF44;&#xF0B;&#xF41;&#xF42;&#xF0B;&#xF56;&#xF45;&#xF74;]. Sera Drepung doesn&apos;t go much. Nyare Khamgpa has to go a little bit more because of Nyare connection with Rat&#xF6; Nyare. That&apos;s why they call it a [unclear sentence].

<p><strong>A:</strong>  The monks, the teachers, everybody will go.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  What&apos;s the sense of going there?   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  Oh, but then other monks will come to debate together.   </p>

So they don&apos;t call it the mangja, traja..they call it morning <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. &#xF5A;&#xF7C;&#xF42;&#xF66;] 1.

<p><strong>Q:</strong>  Oh, really?   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  Because the <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. &#xF58;&#xF44;&#xF0B;&#xF47;] The morning tea served to monks from all the monastic colleges at the main prayer assembly hall.">mangja</span> period is an earlier for the ngatsog or shogtsog and then nyintsog, because <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. &#xF42;&#xFB2;&#xFAD;&#xF0B;&#xF47;] The prayer session sponsored by the tratsang (college) at which tea was served to its monks who attended.">traja</span> things they call nyintsog so they have that.

<p><strong>Q:</strong>  So now, during, okay, let&apos;s take each of these <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. &#xF46;&#xF7C;&#xF66;&#xF0B;&#xF62;] The special grove (&quot;dharma grove&quot;) in monasteries where monks formally met to practice debating.">ch&#xF6;ra</span> which is like a semester, let&apos;s say.   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  Semester, yes.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  Whatever it is...uhh...that means that during that time there&apos;s teaching?   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  Teachings is individual arrangement with individual students and the teacher. So it can be during the ch&#xF6;ntsam, it can be during the ch&#xF6;ra. Teaching is...can be, that is individual arrangement. The official arrangement is the, only debate and meeting and saying prayers.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  So, during the <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. &#xF46;&#xF7C;&#xF66;&#xF0B;&#xF62;] The special grove (&quot;dharma grove&quot;) in monasteries where monks formally met to practice debating.">ch&#xF6;ra</span>, then what happens?   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  During the <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. &#xF46;&#xF7C;&#xF66;&#xF0B;&#xF62;] The special grove (&quot;dharma grove&quot;) in monasteries where monks formally met to practice debating.">ch&#xF6;ra</span>   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  Do you go there in the morning?   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  You go   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  Did the <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. &#xF58;&#xF44;&#xF0B;&#xF47;] The morning tea served to monks from all the monastic colleges at the main prayer assembly hall.">mangja</span> is still or you just   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  Mangja is everyday, <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. &#xF46;&#xF7C;&#xF66;&#xF0B;&#xF62;] The special grove (&quot;dharma grove&quot;) in monasteries where monks formally met to practice debating.">ch&#xF6;ra</span> or no ch&#xF6;ra. It is everyday, 364 days or more, except for few days, I don&apos;t know, M&#xF6;nlam period. But then always there&apos;s a <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. &#xF58;&#xF44;&#xF0B;&#xF47;] The morning tea served to monks from all the monastic colleges at the main prayer assembly hall.">mangja</span>. And after mangja, comes the <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. &#xF5E;&#xF7C;&#xF42;&#xF66;&#xF0B;&#xF46;&#xF7C;&#xF66;] The morning ch&#xF6;ra (debating) session.">shogch&#xF6;</span>, the first ch&#xF6;ra called shogch&#xF6;.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  Shogch&#xF6; mean morning <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. &#xF46;&#xF7C;&#xF66;&#xF0B;&#xF62;] The special grove (&quot;dharma grove&quot;) in monasteries where monks formally met to practice debating.">ch&#xF6;ra</span>?   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  Shogch&#xF6; is not very popular. Quite a lot of junior people will come, not so many senior monks come, they have little debate, few prayers to say, then <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. &#xF5E;&#xF7C;&#xF42;&#xF66;&#xF0B;&#xF46;&#xF7C;&#xF66;] The morning ch&#xF6;ra (debating) session.">shogch&#xF6;</span> will be over.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  Now, who&apos;s in charge of that, now, someone has to be.   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  The <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. &#xF51;&#xF42;&#xF7A;&#xF0B;&#xF66;&#xF90;&#xF7C;&#xF66;] The main disciplinary official in a monastic college (tratsang).">geg&#xF6;</span> is in charge of whole disciplinary action and umdze is responsible for saying the prayers and umm   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  So the <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. &#xF51;&#xF42;&#xF7A;&#xF0B;&#xF66;&#xF90;&#xF7C;&#xF66;] The main disciplinary official in a monastic college (tratsang).">geg&#xF6;</span> and the umdze have to come?   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  They&apos;re there but then they also know other monks will come, they have to come, they come.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  Those two?   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  They two plus ch&#xF6;sungnga [Tib. &#xF46;&#xF7C;&#xF66;&#xF0B;&#xF66;&#xFB2;&#xF74;&#xF44;&#xF0B;&#xF56;] .   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  What&apos;s that?   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  Somebody whose like a caretaker, ky&#xF6;nyer type, he&apos;s responsible for the ch&#xF6;ra. So he&apos;s there too.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  He&apos;s responsible in what sense?   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  Disciplinary and everything, below <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. &#xF51;&#xF42;&#xF7A;&#xF0B;&#xF66;&#xF90;&#xF7C;&#xF66;] The main disciplinary official in a monastic college (tratsang).">geg&#xF6;</span> and he also watch.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  Ch&#xF6;sungnga?   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  Ch&#xF6;sungnga. The monks, some come, some don&apos;t come, its a say, just like one of the meetings, annual meetings somebody announce it, its there every day, you go, you don&apos;t go, that type of thing.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  But like at the meetings, there&apos;s somebody in charge of what prayers gonna be said or what debate&apos;s gonna be or...one person in charge?   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  Its not...its not debate...or group debate, it&apos;s individual debate so wherever you study, you debate with your individual partners, you debate with them. You debate with individual debate.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  So what&apos;s the difference if you debate in your room or if you go to the <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. &#xF46;&#xF7C;&#xF66;&#xF0B;&#xF62;] The special grove (&quot;dharma grove&quot;) in monasteries where monks formally met to practice debating.">ch&#xF6;ra</span>?   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  You can&apos;t debate in your room, you&apos;re not allowed to make noise in your room.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  Oh, really.   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  No, you can&apos;t.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  Oh, I see.   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  You have to go to <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. &#xF46;&#xF7C;&#xF66;&#xF0B;&#xF62;] The special grove (&quot;dharma grove&quot;) in monasteries where monks formally met to practice debating.">ch&#xF6;ra</span> to debate. So you can&apos;t make big noise there. (Disturb) other people.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  But can you debate in the <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. &#xF46;&#xF7C;&#xF66;&#xF0B;&#xF62;] The special grove (&quot;dharma grove&quot;) in monasteries where monks formally met to practice debating.">ch&#xF6;ra</span> when there&apos;s no ch&#xF6;ra?   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  No.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  Only during those times?   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  Only during those times.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  I see, so if you have your own private teacher then what do you do?   </p>

<p><strong>A:</strong>  Your teachers, you individual teachers.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  But they don&apos;t go to the <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. &#xF46;&#xF7C;&#xF66;&#xF0B;&#xF62;] The special grove (&quot;dharma grove&quot;) in monasteries where monks formally met to practice debating.">ch&#xF6;ra</span> to see how you are doing anything?   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  No way.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  So how do they know   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  Everything is your personal and not very much supervized like professors here always giving tests. No way.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  How does he know you understand what   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  No, you go and teaching sort of day after day.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  You go everyday to teach?   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  Not necessarily everyday, they come day after tommorow and three days laters or whatever. This is all private arrangements.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  You go by yourself or?   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  Some of your class fellows may come with you and some classes will go to other teachers. And all of them may come to one teacher. It all depends on the relation of individualized relation.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  What does the teacher do when you come there, he says this is the   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  You will read certain portion and he will ask you questions and the method of the teaching is like a greek philosover by questioning and make you understand better.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  He doesn&apos;t say that this is the Pharchin, it was written in   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  No, no. This portion is supposed to learn by reading or knowledge whatever it is. He will read the text wherever it is covering your... and he will say &quot;well this book says this. What do you think it means and then you will say something and he will argue with you, debate with you and say I have read in such and the such book and it say something else and say would you like to look at it. And tommorow, they ask, &quot;did you read it? What do you think about it? That&apos;s how they teach.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  That&apos;s pretty loose.   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  This is very loose, I mean if you have 20 students together one teacher, maybe ask you, maybe call on you, maybe says not now. Today&apos;s thing is ... and say this is in the book in line so and so. What do you think? Don&apos;t you think this is will contradict with such and such thing. And if not, what is the reason about it. In that manner that goes.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  Oh wow! Where do you get the books from?   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  Well, somehow you have them around.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  Do you buy them or?   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  Well, the printers are there and you can buy from them. Printed books are sold everywhere and <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. &#xF42;&#xFB2;&#xFAD;&#xF0B;&#xF5A;&#xF44;] A &quot;college&quot; within a monastery, for example, in Drepung Monastery there were four main tratsang: Gomang, Loseling, Deyang and Ngagpa.

I don&apos;t know how it made available, but that is there around. You borrow it, you have it and big borrow stake is there. Everybody, at least each have a <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. &#xF61;&#xF72;&#xF42;&#xF0B;&#xF46;] The tsenyi teaching materials used by a monastic college.">yigcha</span> copy.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  Yigcha copy means the copy of all the books in the <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. &#xF61;&#xF72;&#xF42;&#xF0B;&#xF46;] The tsenyi teaching materials used by a monastic college.">yigcha</span>?   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  No, the <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. &#xF61;&#xF72;&#xF42;&#xF0B;&#xF46;] The tsenyi teaching materials used by a monastic college.">yigcha</span>, the root [text] and the comentary of the yigcha both. The yigcha are available with you. You may not have the whole book, you may have the books dealing with that portion that somebody did 2-3 years before and not needed and you borrow from it. Anyway, everybody have a copy.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  You have to memmorize the books also?   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  Certain thing people do and certain don&apos;t. Some people memmorize and ome people don&apos;t memmorize. You can memmorize, it will be helpful to you and if you don&apos;t memmorize, they may not be that helpful. You read it and you understand it.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  But, basically, unless you read so much, you don&apos;t get much guidence like directions? I mean nobody says there are four schools and Buddhism and we stress the <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. &#xF51;&#xF56;&#xF74;&#xF0B;&#xF58;] The Madhyamaka text (&quot;the Middle Way&quot;).">Uma</span> school and the main principel schools like that?   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  No way. But if you are study <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. &#xF51;&#xF56;&#xF74;&#xF0B;&#xF58;] The Madhyamaka text (&quot;the Middle Way&quot;).">Uma</span>, then that time they probably come and they say sort of Ngar Juna, the Buddha Palina is there and this and that. And it is more or less you have to do lot of your own study.   </p>
