**Q:**  Please tell me about the reforms in 1950s.   

**A:**  One of the most important reforms implemented by the Tibetan government during the 1950s was that-usually, there were only the monk officials and the lay officials who had the hair knot [Tib. spa cog]. But after the Preparatory Committee of the Tibet Autonomous Region [Tib. rang skyong ljongs gra sgrig u yon lhan khang] was set up, from 1965-1959, there were some Tibetan government officials who were called the Sogpo [Tib. sog po], Mongolians. They were not Mongolians, but the reason they were called Sogpo was that they were dressed in Mongolian dress [Tib. sog chas]. They were not allowed to have the hair knot like the lay officials and they were not allowed to wear the uniform of the lay officials.   

**Q:**  They were a new [type of] government official, right?   

**A:**  Yes.   

**Q:**  So how did they become government officials?   

**A:**  In the beginning, some of the monk officials who lost their celibacy became like Mongols (Tib. Sogpo). They were wearing the Mongolian style dress and they were working in the government offices located in Lhasa. They had the same right as the 7th rank lay official. But I didn't hear that they went to the dzongs and the estates of the Tibetan government to become county heads [Tib. rdzong sdod]. Later, even if they were not monk officials who lost their celibacy, any ordinary person was allowed to take an exam and if their Tibetan writing and reading were okay, they were admitted to be Tibetan government officials through the exam. There were many people admitted in Lhasa and there were at least 30-40 of them. Many of them were also incarcerated in the Chinese jail and they were treated the same as the lay officials.   

**Q:**  They should have had the Western style haircut [Tib. bang ka li], right?   

**A:**  Yes, probably, they could have been bald, but they were not allowed to have long hair. They didn't have the estates. They were probably paid a salary when they worked for the Tibetan government. I don't know how much they were paid. After that, the monk officials who lost their celibacy became Sogpos though they were not allowed to become lay officials.   

**Q:**  Were they the same as the clerks in the Tsechag Treasury [Tib. rtse phyag jo lags]?   

**A:**  They were higher than the clerks. They were real government officials. In the Chinese jail, the clerks of the Tsechag were classified as the representatives of the serf owners [Tib. mnga' tshab]. All of the Sogpos were among the real government officials. This was the most important reform. They didn't differentiate the people and there weren't any back door relations.   

**Q:**  Who gave the exams?   

**A:**  The Financial Bureau [Tib. rtsis khang], probably gave them the exams. I am not sure about this. But, the exam was probably not that strict or hard like with high standard poems and grammar. If they were good with regular Tibetan writing and reading, it was okay.   

**Q:**  When they meet people on their way, did they call them "Your excellency, Kungo [Tib. sku ngo]"?   

**A:**  Yes, they became kungo. But, they were called Sogpo in general, and they become more and more in number.   

**Q:**  Was that in 1957-58?   

**A:**  It was from 1956-1958. When the Preparatory Committee of the Tibet Autonomous Region was set up, there were the cadres from three sides; the Tibetan government, the Labrang and Kham [Tib. gzhung bla khams gsum]. So a large number of Tibetan government officials had to be sent there. So at that time, there weren't so many lay officials. So I guess they increased the number of the lay officials and admitted the Sogpos. Some people were telling me that except the monk officials and thelay officials who had hair knots, the ordinary people were not allowed to become government officials. Actually, the monk officials were from the ordinary people and the Sogpos were also from the ordinary people, and they were allowed to become government officials.
