### Tape 1  
**Q:**  I am 78 years old and was born in Chusum
                    County [near Lhagyari]. I was 14 years old when I entered the Tibetan army.   

**Q:**  Why did you join the army?   

**A:**  I was a government tax. Our land was
                    "leased." If one family sent one person to serve as a soldier and that person
                    died, then they had to send another person to serve in the army. I was sent
                    because one of my aunts' sons died and my younger brother was too young to serve
                    and the family didn't want to hire someone else and pay them.   

**Q:**  Usually when a young boy is 18 years old, he
                    could join the army. Why did you go when you were 14?   

**A:**  That was because we had a relative in the
                    army who helped me to join although I was young. Families that received land
                    from the government send a man to serve in the army. We had one gang of land.
                    [Because the government had given them land with an attached corvée military
                    tax]. After I joined the army, I stayed in Kham for 17 years. When I first
                    joined the army I was trained to blow the bugle to give signals, but after some
                    time, since the government sent its soldiers to many different places, I was
                    also sent to a place where I became a regular soldier. I served (was servant
                    for) the shengo named Demba. I served him for many years.   

**Q:**  Did you have a gun?   

**A:**  I had an English "khartum" gun and 100
                    bullets.   

**Q:**  Did you do military drills and training?   

**A:**  I did training.   

**Q:**  When did you arrive in Kham?   

**A:**  I arrived in Kham when I was 14, and stayed
                    there for 17 years. In Chamdo there was a big military camp. The government
                    considered Chamdo as the border between Tibet and China and from that camp they
                    sent the army to the frontier to protect the border. My station was at Riwoche.
                    The general of our unit camp was [the aristocratic official] Namseling. Then
                    after him it was General Shakabpa. He was a general for many years in Kham.
                    Shakabpa was a very good general because he was very honest. I was about thirty
                    when he came. After that, many Chamdo people asked the government to let him
                    stay longer in Kham. He probably stayed in Kham for 10 years. Usually they
                    changed generals after 3 years. Then they sent a new general
                    named Phulungwaa [Tib. phu lungwa ba]. So when the Chinese Peoples' Liberation
                    Army came to Tibet, Phulungwaa was the general in Kham. Dorje Tsering first
                    stayed in Khyungpo Tengchen county for 8 years. Then they sent him to Jagsam in
                    Riwoche. I was stationed at the place called at Garma Yodang.   

**Q:**  What work did you usually do?   

**A:**  Usually there was nothing for us to do in the
                    army. We just stayed in the army barracks and waited until there was an order
                    from the general. If something happened on the border, then we had to go and
                    find out.   

**Q:**  How did you get to Jagsam?   

**A:**  I was sent there to defend it.   

**Q:**  What kind of defense work did you do?   

**A:**  If you go from Jagsam and cross a mountain
                    pass you are in Nangchen. The Chinese were staying in Nangchen. So when I was
                    staying in Riwoche County, one time they sent me and about 12 soldiers to Jagsam
                    (which is on the border) because there was a rumor that the Chinese were coming
                    to Tibet. So as border guards, we had to stay on the border.   

**Q:**  What did you do at Jagsam?   

**A:**  We had to stay up at night to see if the
                    Chinese were coming. We stayed on the pass.   

**Q:**  How did the fighting come about?   

**A:**  One morning when my friends and I were
                    staying on the border, suddenly we saw lots of Chinese coming to the Tibetan
                    side of the mountain. I looked, but couldn't make out who they were. I told my
                    friends that there are lots of Chinese coming, did you see them? My friends said
                    no they may not be Chinese. They when we looked carefully we saw it was lots of
                    Chinese coming up to the pass. Then I also saw a lot of
                    Chinese coming up from around the sides, not only to the top of the mountain.
                    Then myself and the other 12 soldiers thought that the situation was really bad.
                    We decided that, "If we die, let's die together. If one of us flees, we will
                    shoot him. Let's protect our border and stop the Chinese from coming." Then we
                    Tibetans started to shoot at the Chinese. We were only 12 people. We fired down
                    at them, but that did not stop the Chinese from coming. It was hard to stop
                    them. We continued to shoot at the Chinese soldiers, but however much we fired,
                    the Chinese still kept coming. Then the situation was very bad for us as all of
                    our bullets were finished. Then a bugle instructor who was with us said now we
                    have to flee, so we fled. The instructor and I stayed until the end (last) and
                    then we ran to the bottom of the hill on the Tibetan side (of the border). The
                    Chinese didn't appear at the peak at once, so I and the senior bugler stayed
                    behind while the others descended. Then we also descended. The bugle teacher
                    stopped to have a smoke and I washed as I was sweaty. I washed my face. Then we reached the Jagsam bridge and crossed it. At that
                    time one person gave me [bullets] and then we saw the Chinese soldiers appearing
                    on the other side. The Chinese were yelling, but I couldn't understand what they
                    were saying. From where I was, I couldn't see where the others had fled to, so I
                    was alone. I didn't know where the other soldiers had gone.
                    Then I went to the [nearby] monastery and found that the Tibetan soldiers were
                    there drinking tea. I said to them that the Chinese have crossed the bridge so I
                    am leaving. Even if you guys stay here, I still want to leave. Then we left the
                    monastery and fled into a huge forest behind the monastery. When we arrived in
                    the forest, we heard the Chinese had arrived in the monastery and were making
                    lots of noise.   

**Q:**  How many Chinese did you kill?   

**A:**  I killed a lot, but they still came. They
                    didn't withdraw despite their losses. They were about to leave when they used
                    binoculars and saw that there were lots of saddled horses outside the monastery
                    because at that time there were 100 Tibetan soldiers in the monastery including
                    the rupön and gyagpön, and they thought probably that they were about to flee.
                    So instead of withdrawing, the Chinese attacked.   

**Q:**  How many of the 12 Tibetan soldiers died?   

**A:**  As many Chinese as we shot, they kept coming,
                    stepping on top of the corpses. So because of this, we ran away through the
                    mountains. We ran for 7 days without any tsamba. We weren't with Phulungwaa
                    Depön. He had fled from Riwoche before this. When we reached Lhodzong,
                    Phulungwaa was there. We went from Lhodzong to Shopando, but from Shopando,
                    Phulungwaa took us [back to] Lhodzong. At Lhodzong there were 140 loads of
                    ammunition. We transported this one satsig [one day's journey]. Then the Khambas
                    were in league with the Chinese, so we couldn't get any transport animals from
                    the Khambas. So the Chinese seized Lhodzong. The Chinese
                    caught them [Dorje and his friends]. Phulungwaa was also captured by the
                    Chinese. The Chinese said to bring our guns, axes and shovels. I thought the
                    Chinese planned to kill us and then use the shovels and axes to bury us. The
                    Chinese gave us a bowl of tsamba every day and sent Phulungwaa to Chamdo. Then
                    the Chinese asked us whether we wanted to be Chinese soldiers or to go back to
                    our home towns. They also told us that if we wanted to be Chinese soldiers, they
                    would immediately give us uniforms and other things. If we wanted to go back
                    home, they would give us a pass and some expense money. None of our people
                    joined the People's Liberation Army, so they were given 3 dayan. We wanted to go
                    home because the Kashag was still there. We though we would have another chance
                    for revenge. If we wanted to go home, they gave us some money and passes (to
                    show to Chinese soldiers so we wouldn't be killed). They didn't ask us anything
                    or beat us, but they did take our guns.   

**Q:**  Did the Chinese ask any questions or beat
                    you?   

**A:**  No. They were very nice. My friends and I all
                    went back home to Lhasa from Chamdo.   

**Q:**  When the Chinese released you did the Chinese
                    send any soldiers to accompany you?   

**A:**  No. But on the road we met a lot of Chinese
                    soldiers and we were very afraid that we would be killed by the Chinese.
                    However, the Chinese paid us no attention and did not stop us. When we met
                    Chinese soldiers on the road, we were surprised that they Chinese paid no
                    attention at all to us. Then we got to Lhasa. In the courtyard
                    the Chinese were grouped in small units. We had a shengo and he was taking
                    horses and mules from the monastery. I came out with the shengo. Below the
                    monastery there was a village in which there were many Chinese troops. They
                    didn't say anything to us. We stayed a night with a villager. I had a mule.   

**Q:**  When you were at Lhodzong, what did you
                    think?   

**A:**  I thought, "One day I will die, but before
                    that I want to kill 5 or 6 Chinese."   

**Q:**  When you were fighting in Kham, were the
                    Khamba people helping you fight the Chinese?   

**A:**  No. There were no Khamba people helping us
                    because they hated the Tibetan government because there was such heavy taxation.
                    And also at that time the Chinese were saying that if they came to Tibet there
                    wouldn't be any taxes and they will help the poor people and they will also
                    divide the rich peoples' land and things. So actually the Khamba people were
                    helping the Chinese and when the Tibetan government soldiers were running away,
                    the Khamba people would kill them. When I was running to Lhodzong, several
                    people were killed by the Khambas. At that time the Khambas were helping the
                    Chinese, but after the Chinese stayed in Tibet many years, the Khambas also got
                    a lot of taxes and turned against the Chinese and had an uprising and fought
                    with them.   

**Q:**  Why did the Khambas help the Chinese instead
                    of the Tibetan soldiers? Were there any other reasons?   

**A:**  When Tibetan government soldiers stayed in
                    Kham, there were some rich soldiers/leaders who used to loan money to the
                    Khambas and then hound them for the payment. So the Khambas were angry about
                    this. The second reason was the government taxes collected by the military
                    officers. So the Khambas hated these and that is why some Khambas wanted to and
                    did kill Tibetan soldiers.   

**Q:**  Were the heads of Tibetan army Khambas?   

**A:**  No, all were Central Tibetans (üpa).   

**Q:**  How were the relations between the Khambas
                    and the Tibetan soldiers before the Tibetans were fighting the Chinese?   

**A:**  The relationship was good, but after the
                    Chinese started coming to Tibet the Chinese spread lots of stories about taking
                    from rich and giving to poor, and about no taxes, so the Khambas believed the
                    rumors and they thought that the Chinese would be better than the Tibetan
                    government. So while we got along well before, as soon as the Chinese came the
                    Khamba's attitude changed and they sort of rebelled.   

**Q:**  How did the Chinese soldiers catch you in
                    Lhodzong?   

**A:**  The Depön told me the Chinese were coming. I
                    had long hair and boots like a Khamba then. I told the Depön that we can hold
                    them off for a day. The road into Lhodzong was bad with mountains on the sides
                    and in front so we could sit [on the pass] and fire down on them. At this time
                    the Chinese and Khambas had surrounded us without our knowing it so Depön
                    Phulungwaa left his horse and fled [on foot] with a servant. We planned to take
                    the Depön's horse and flee. Then suddenly the Chinese attacked with their guns
                    firing. We had a Bren-gun operator with us and the bugle instructor. I was in a
                    tent ready to fire at them. The Chinese were yelling to us, "Throw your weapons
                    on the ground." My associate, the instructor, said throw your gun to the
                    Chinese, there is no sense shooting. So I did this and stood up and was
                    captured.   

**Q:**  When you threw away your guns, did the
                    Chinese kill anyone?"   

**A:**  No. Once you threw the guns, they wouldn't
                    kill you.   

**Q:**  If you had held your guns what would have
                    happened?   

**A:**  I thought that the Chinese would have shot
                    us. I wanted to shoot the Chinese too, but the instructor argued with me a lot
                    so I finally listened to him. I really wanted to shoot some Chinese and even
                    though I would die I would kill 4-5 Chinese. If I died at that time, then my
                    family would not have to send another soldier for a few years [a custom in his
                    home town]. If a soldier died in war this was considered good in his home
                    village.  When Shakabpa was the general in the regiment he was
                    a very good person. He used to put 15-20 people everywhere and he would stay in
                    the main camp. Shakabpa treated soldiers and other people very well. Shakabpa
                    also gave soldiers lots of beer (chang) and some money. When Shakabpa was the
                    general the other leaders would not beat the soldiers and would treat them very
                    well. Lots of people liked Shakabpa. When Phulungwaa was the general, he did not
                    have that much power and the lower leaders (such as the rupön) had the power.   

**Q:**  What about Ngabö and Lhalu?   

**A:**  That was later. I was not a soldier then.
                    When Lhalu was a general in Kham, he withdrew the soldiers from the border and
                    also treated the soldiers poorly. When Ngabö became a general, he lost the war.
                    Ngabö did not even have a chance to fight the Chinese soldiers. When they lost
                    the war, the Tibetan government soldiers burned the armory in Chamdo. I didn't
                    see that because I wasn't there at that time.  When my friends
                    and I went to Lhasa, we told the military headquarters what happened and it gave
                    us two months' salary and let us go back to our home town. I went to my home
                    town in Lhagyari. When I was in my home town I got a message from my brother who
                    was staying in Lhasa working as a religious art painter. He said don't stay in
                    our home town. You can't do anything there because you've been in the army for a
                    long time so you don't know how to do agricultural work. Just come back to
                    Lhasa. I listened to my brother and came to Lhasa. My brother told me, "Now it's
                    very hard to live in Lhasa. You have to learn some skill." My brother said he
                    would teach me how to paint. I said, "Now I am old. Just like you can't teach an
                    old horse to run fast and teach an old dzo how to plow, so I won't be able to
                    learn any painting. I don't want to learn any skills." My brother died in 1992.
                    Then I started to do some business and went to most of the Tibetan pilgrimage
                    sites and then after that I met my wife and got married. We met in Lhasa.   

**Q:**  How did you meet your wife?   

**A:**  I knew one of the monks who belonged to
                    Phabongkha Monastery. He had given many loans in the Dzashö area. We were good
                    friends. The monk told me don't stay like this, I will help you find a wife.
                    Since he knew this area and these women, the monk introduced me to the woman who
                    became my wife. Then my wife and I stayed in Lhasa one year since she had no
                    relatives and my wife was very sick. In 1958, we returned to Dzashö and lived
                    there since then.  After the uprising, there was gyarshib. At
                    that time I was doing trading and I had to pay a tax of about 1,000 yuan. I told
                    the Work Committee at that time about what I did for business and said the tax
                    was too high. Then the Work Committee reduced this tax from 1000 to 300. Since
                    at that time I had no money to pay the tax, the Work Committee took my horse as
                    worth 150 yuan. After that, the Work Committee came to the village and asked for
                    the tax and I said I would pay, but actually I didn't pay that money. Then they
                    finally came and took one of my oxen. After that I sold my one kau
                    (necklace/box) to one of the nomads. Then I told the Work Committee about
                    selling the necklace and I told them I promised I will never do any business
                    again. I said I met a nomad and he asked me if I had any goods to sell and I
                    told that nomad that I have a kau necklace/box and sold it to the nomad for some
                    meat and one ball of butter. I told the Work Committee I had already eaten those
                    things and asked them if there was any tax I had to pay for that. The Work
                    Committee said that it didn't matter. There was no tax for meat and butter.  Then after that, the government treated me as someone under
                    surveillance [tatog] [a bad class classification]. Sometimes they asked me to do
                    some work such as going to dzonshu, near Nyimajanga, to build a bridge. While
                    building the bridge, I broke my leg and the government gave me about 40 yuan.
                    For 7 years after that I didn't work. That was the only money I ever got from
                    the government. During the time of the brigade, I got nothing. After that, I
                    heard that if a person broke an arm or leg while doing government work the
                    government will pay some money for that. At that time I did not get a chance to
                    attend any meeting about that, but I heard about it and I asked the government
                    whether I could get money. The government told me that I could get money, but I
                    never received any. Then I also heard that in the past, those who paid business
                    taxes to the government got repaid later. When I asked the government about
                    whether I can get the money I paid as taxes, they said that they already paid
                    me, but I didn't get any money.   

**Q:**  When you were a Tibetan government soldier,
                    what was your salary?   

**A:**  At first I received nine ngüsang, then I got
                    18 ngüsang every month. That was for buying tea and meat and butter. Then there
                    was 2 khe of barley per month from the government. Usually every year my family
                    sent me some clothes or some money to buy clothing. From my salary, I bought tea
                    and butter and so on. My family had to send me 2 rolls of woven woolen cloth.
                    Sometimes I sold the woolen cloth and drank beer with friends with the money.   

**Q:**  Tell me about life in the army. Were there
                    canteens?   

**A:**  Usually the soldiers cooked by themselves. We
                    ground our barley and roasted it, and if there was a water mill to grind it, we
                    used to do that or if not, we did it by hand. If someone didn't know how to
                    grind it himself, he had to hire another person to grind for him. When I stayed
                    in the border, we had our own military camp and didn't stay in villages.   

**Q:**  When the Chinese caught you and then let you
                    go, what did you think at that time?   

**A:**  I thought we lost a part of Tibet, but didn't
                    lose the part with Lhasa. So I thought that the Tibetan government would fight
                    with the Chinese and at that time I would get my revenge. I was not afraid of
                    the Chinese.   

**Q:**  How were you treated?   

**A:**  They treated me very well. They didn't beat
                    me and didn't ask questions. They said they weren't like soldiers; they were
                    like beggars. They were very poor. When we came from Lhodzong to Lhasa, we saw
                    lots of Chinese soldiers riding horses and also walking. The walking ones were
                    very tired. One time we met a walking Chinese soldier who was very tired and we
                    walked with him to Lhasa. The Chinese guy told me that he had parents and a
                    family and I thought that the Chinese must be like a Tibetan soldier in that he
                    joined the army as a tax. Those Chinese soldiers were not like today's soldiers.
                    The old soldiers seemed very good, but today's Chinese soldiers will beat anyone
                    they capture and ask questions.   

**Q:**  What was the structure of the Riwoche
                    regiment, how many soldiers? And what kind of military officers were there and
                    where did the soldiers come from?   

**A:**  We were the Jadang Regiment.   

**A:**  Why did they name it Jadang?   

**A:**  It was named according to the letters in the
                    alphabet. Ja was one of the 30 consonants. Shakabpa was the depön for a long
                    time. Under the Depön, there were 2 rupön and 4 gyagpön. One rupön was called
                    Druggye [Tib. 'brug rgyal]. He was born in Lhoka Maltro Dechen Chökhor [Tib. mal
                    gro bde chen chos 'khor]. I don't know the name of the other rupön, but he was
                    also from the same place. I was originally from Lhagyari [Tib. lha rgya ri]
                    which is now called Chusum [Tib. chu gsum] County. I don't know the name of the
                    other rupön, but he was from the same place. I was under Rupön Druggye. There
                    were 25 shengo. Each shengo had two jupön [squad leaders] under him. Each shengo
                    had two jupön under him for a total of 25 soldiers. One squad had 12 and the
                    other had 13.   

**Q:**  Where were the soldiers from?   

**A:**  Most were conscripted as a tax. A few were
                    hired soldiers. Some of the sons of soldiers were hired by others to serve, but
                    these were few.   

**A:**  Did the soldiers come from all the places in
                    Tibet?   

**A:**  Our Jadang Regiment was from E Lhagyari and
                    from Nyan county [Tib. gnyan], Gongkar [Tib. gong dkar], Lhüntse [Tib. lhun
                    rtse] and Chushul [Tib. chu shur]. Actually, Nyan belonged to Lhüntse. So most
                    of the soldiers were from 4 dzong in Lhoka. Some were obliged to send 2
                    soldiers, some 25. Some were also sent to the Trapchi Regiment and the Gusung
                    Regiment. When I joined the regiment, there were said to be soldiers from Samye
                    [Tib. bsam yas], but really there were none. Samye was said to be exempt because
                    the Samye people worked on the construction of the Samye Monastery and they had
                    a hard time. We had a total of 529 soldiers.   

**Q:**  How many soldiers would stay in the main
                    base?   

**A:**  Most of them would stay in the main
                    regimental base with the depön and rupön in Riwoche. The rupön stayed in
                    Riwoche, the depön sometimes would tour the other locations of the troops. Each
                    gyagpön had 4 shengo and they stayed wherever their soldiers were. The same with
                    each shengo. He stayed with the 25 troops under him at his location.   

**Q:**  What kind of place was Riwoche?   

**A:**  Riwoche had 2 monasteries up on the mountain.
                    Under these there was the Riwoche temple called Lhagang Thanggyama [Tib. lha
                    khang thang rgya ma] and below that was our regiment.   

**Q:**  Was there a river flowing in the middle?   

**A:**  No. The monastery, the temple and the
                    regiment were in one place. The regiment was on the south side of Riwoche and
                    two monasteries were on the north.   

**Q:**  Where did the peasants live?   

**A:**  There were just a few scattered düjung living
                    around the regiment. They didn't have land and didn't have to work much as a
                    tax, but they would work for the county called Rigya Lanyer [Tib. ri rgya bla
                    gnyer] doing jobs like sweeping, etc. The bigger treba lived in other places.   

**Q:**  When you went to Nangchen from Riwoche, was
                    there only one route or what?   

**A:**  There was only one route. If one crossed a
                    mountain pass one would reach Riwoche. When you crossed the iron bridge, Jagsam
                    [Tib. lcags zam], you reached Nangchen which belonged to the Siling territory
                    [Qinghai Province]. It was directly north. The Jagsam bridge was terrible and
                    swayed back and forth when you went on it. After awhile you got used to going on
                    it.   

**Q:**  When you come from Nangchen to Riwoche, did
                    you have to cross the Jagsam?   

**A:**  There was also another route in the upper
                    part of the valley via a pass called Potokha. In the past, when I was in
                    Khyungpo Tengchen [Tib. khyung po steng chen], we heard the Chinese were coming
                    so I and 25 soldiers were stationed at that pass. We stayed there all night.
                    This pass was the border where the other side was Chinese and this side was
                    Tibetan territory. When we were there at that pass, there were also a lot of
                    militia from Markham [Tib. smar khams] and Khyungpo Tengchen. So there were two
                    routes. When you reached this Potokha pass, you could go to Nangchen, Khyungpo
                    Tengchen, and Riwoche. This pass was directly north of Riwoche. Below Potokha
                    there was another hill. We were stationed on it.   

**Q:**  When you had to go guard that place, did you
                    have to cross the pass?   

**A:**  We didn't cross the Nangchen pass but stayed
                    on the top of the small hill. The next morning the Chinese crossed the pass and
                    arrived at the bottom of the hill on the Tibetan territory side. At about
                    sunrise, I and another soldier went to watch and I saw many people down there. I
                    told my partner Jonden [Tib. 'byor ldan], "The Chinese may have reached here."
                    He said, "They might be the people who have come to help the Khambas, but as we
                    looked down we saw that the Chinese had left their horses and mules on the upper
                    part and they were down there carrying their guns, which were shining. I said,
                    "Shall I shoot?" He said, "Don't shoot for a while." Then the Chinese were
                    coming just beneath us and we fought with them.   

**Q:**  Can you draw a map of Riwoche indicating
                    where the monasteries were located?   

**A:**  No, I can't. I never draw things.   

**Q:**  When the troops were scattered in many
                    places, in which places were the soldiers of the Riwoche regiment stationed?   

**A:**  Many were at Khyungpo Serta [Tib. ser rtsa].
                    It was one day from Khyungpo Tengchen. Later the regiment was merged into the
                    Riwoche regiment and we stayed in Tengchen for a long time. Between Tengchen and
                    Serta there is a pass called Sharla and I stayed there with 25 troops. From
                    Khyungpo Tengchen to Riwoche was 3 day trip on horseback. From Sharla to
                    Tengchen was one day on horseback. There were always 25 troops at Sharla. If you
                    went down from Sharla there was Jönkha [Tib. byon kha] where there were more
                    soldiers than on Sharla. From Jönkha to Riwoche was half a day.   

**Q:**  How many soldiers were stationed there?   

**A:**  There were 2 shengo [50 troops] at Jönkha. At
                    Jagsam there were 100 troops all the time. From Jagsam to Riwoche was 3 days on
                    foot and it was near to Nangchen. Later, when we heard that the Chinese soldiers
                    were coming, we went there to the place where I had been guarding, the place
                    called Garmageru of which the miser belonged to Chamdo.   

**Q:**  How near was it to Jagsam?   

**A:**  It was a long distance on the opposite side.
                    Later, when we were about to make war, we didn't stay at Garmageru and we were
                    merged with Riwoche and we were sent to Jagsam.   

**Q:**  How many soldiers were there in Garmageru?   

**A:**  There were 25 soldiers. We also left 25
                    troops at Poyü [Tib. spo yul]. Later when we heard the Chinese were coming, they
                    were recalled to Riwoche.   

**Q:**  Why did they call them back?
