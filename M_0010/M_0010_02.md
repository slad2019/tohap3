### Tape 2  
**Q:** The life style of the monastery wouldn’t be the same every day. For
                    example, sometimes you had to go to fetch water, and sometimes you had to make a
                    fire. And sometimes you had to go to class and the chöra. So there were many
                    things going on so tell us something about the daily activities of the monks
                    with examples?  

**A:** The ordinary monks should have gotten up early in the morning and have
                    done the three prostrations. And they should have said "Please forgive me if I
                    do anything wrong." Then they had to pray the taking refuge, the [Tib. skyab
                    ‘gro]. In Sera, Drepung and in Ganden, they would pray the Ganden Lhagya [Tib.
                    dga' ldan lha brgya] and from the Lam rim [Tib. lam rim] they would pray the
                    Yönden Shigyurma [Tib. yon tan gzhi gyur ma]. This was the morning routine.  

**Q:** How long would it take?  

**A:** It would just take half an hour. If there was tsomja, then we should have
                    gone to join the tsomja. If there was mangja in Drepung Tsogchen, then the young
                    monks would shout a signal that there was mangja. If you went to mangja there
                    was tea and tsampa served.  

**Q:** Was there tsomja before the mangja?  

**A:** I don’t think there was tsomja before mangja. After finishing the mangja,
                    then the tsomja would begin. Sometimes, the tsomja could be carried on for the
                    whole day and there were 3-4 sessions. When went go to tsomja you had to take
                    your own tsampa, and you would get the tea in the assembly. You have to do
                    whatever prayer [was] requested by the sponsor. Sometimes, there was also salary
                    or alms given. In the [dharma grove] session time, in Lumbum [Tib. klu ‘bum]
                    Khamtsen, they would beat a big iron key like a gong. When they beat the key,
                    all the new monks should have left [their] monk’s cloak [Tib. zla gam] and hat,
                    and the khamtsen gegen would come to check whether they had left the gown and
                    the hat nicely.  

**Q:** You had to leave your gown when you went to chöra in the tratsang?  

**A:** Yes, you had to leave it in the courtyard of the common house, jikhang
                    [Tib. spyi khang] in the khamtsen.  

**Q:** So who would look after the gown? Was it the khamtsen gegen?  

**A:** The khamtsen gegen would look after the gown if we went to the dharma
                    grove in the morning. In Gomang, every semester, which is known as chöthog for
                    the first three days, they had to read the shortest text of Pargyaparamita [Tib.
                    brgyad stong] in the morning session in the chöra.  

**Q:**  Was it read in the tratsang?  

**A:** Yes, then they would pray the text call Jambey Tsenjö [Tib. ‘jam dpal
                    mtshan brjod] in the chöra every day.  

**Q:** You mean to say that they would pray the Jambey Tsenjö in the dharma
                    grove?  

**A:** Yes, then they would pray the Sherab Nyingppo [Tib. shes rab snying po]
                    also.  

**Q:** Was there enough time for praying Jambey Tsenjö?   

**A:** It would take a long time for the morning session and then the abbot
                    would check the monks.   

**Q:** So at the morning session would the abbot check the monks?  

**A:** Sometimes he would and sometimes not. After that, the monks would pray
                    some Droma prayer and when the morning session was over, the monks would start
                    the debate in the grades. After that, if there was afternoon mangja in the
                    tsogchen, then we had to go to get the mangja. For that we would get tsampa,
                    salt and soda [Tib. bul tog].  

**Q:** There wasn’t any afternoon mangja except on the great summer session
                    [Tib. dbyar chos chen mo], right?  

**A:**  Sometimes there was an afternoon mangja.  

**Q:** There was afternoon mangja on Ganden Ngamjö and Shimchö [Tib. bzhi
                    mchod], the Death Anniversary of Chamchen Chöje [Tib. byams chen chos rje], who
                    was the founder of the Sera Monastery. And also there was afternoon mangja on
                    the religious rite, the rigdra, and the rigdra would be held on the great
                    session break [Tib. chos mtshams chen mo], right?  

**A:**  Yes, there was mangja in the afternoon on those occasions.  

**Q:** At the time of [the] rigdra, the dharma grove was not open in the
                    tratsang, right?  

**A:** If there was mangja then we had to go to the mangja. In the morning
                    chöra, we had to pray Jambey Tshanjö [Tib. ‘jam dpal mtshan rjod], which is the
                    root trantra of [the] Manjushri [Tib. ‘jam dpal dbyang] text and Sherab Nyingppo
                    [Tib. shes rab snying po], which is the shortest text of heart Sutra with Droma.
                    The gegö would clap his hands, which indicated the morning session was over.
                    After that, each and [every] individual class would start. From karam [Tib. bk’a
                    ram] grade the two monks would come and ask question to each class. After that,
                    if there was afternoon mangja, which is the second mangja in the tsogchen, they
                    would go to join it. After that, if there was traja, then we would go to the
                    traja and the tsomja. If there was a gap, we had to go to one's own teacher and
                    get the teaching.  

**Q:** Was the custom in Gomang the same as Loseling where in order to get alms,
                    you didn't have to go in and stand outside, which is called kelen, the monks who
                    take share of alms?  

**A:**  In Gomang, there was the kelen. The kelen would receive their alms from
                    [the] outside.  

**Q:** The monks who come to get the kelen would get the alms from the
                    courtyard, right?  

**A:** Yes.  

**Q:** In Loseling, the kelen would be given in the dharma grove?  

**A:** Yes.  

**Q:** If you didn’t feel like going to the dharma grove, then you didn't have
                    to go, right?  

**A:** If you didn't want to go to the dharma grove, you could pick [up] your
                    gown and hat when the khamtsen gegen was going around. And you had to close your
                    door from inside as if you went to the dharma grove. In Lumbum, the discipline
                    was very strict. In other khamtsen, they didn't beat the key.  

**Q:**  In the Lumbum were there monks who didn't study tsenyi?  

**A:** Yes, there were many monks who didn't study tsenyi. Every monk should put
                    [down] the cloak, dagam, whether you studied tsenyi or not.  

**Q:** What do you mean by dagam?  

**A:** The dagam is like an gown without sleeves. The monks who were good in
                    tsenyi had to go to receive the teaching. In the afternoon, we had to go to the
                    dharma grove.  

**Q:** Did you make fire in the morning or not?  

**A:** If there was no mangja or tsomja, then we had to make a fire in the shag
                    and make tea. If there was mangja, then we didn’t have to make a fire in the
                    shag.  

**Q:** Where did you get the fuel? Did you have to buy the fuel?  

**A:** We had to buy the cow dung for the fuel. After finishing the afternoon
                    dharma grove, [then you would go to] the nyinchö, which was the more elaborated
                    than the morning session shogchö, where you go to individual debates by the
                    individual monks, and they combine together and say few prayers. After that, we
                    would have a group meeting that we called thamja, which was [when] the senior
                    ones would debate with [the] junior ones. When the evening session started with
                    the prayer session, we had to pray Droma [Tib. sgrol ma], which is the Tara
                    Puja. [In] The beginning of the semester we would do the prayer 21 Tara Puja,
                    and after that it would increase to 12 Droma Puja every day. And at the end of
                    the month, an additional 16 Tara Puja would go and on top of that, we had to
                    pray the short Heart Sutra and the prayer of lion faced dakini, the [Tib. seng
                    gdong ma]. After that, we had to debate. We had to remain in the dharma grove
                    until 9-10 p.m.  

**Q:** If there was tsomja, when would they hold it?  

**A:** Normally if there was tsomja, that would come after the afternoon
                    session. Sometimes, if there were important rituals, like somebody specifically
                    requested to do it, then the khamtsen would inform [us] to come to tsomja right
                    after the kurim, which was the evening prayer. So in that case, after the
                    general meeting, the kurim, they would also skip the debate and they would have
                    the tsomja.  

**Q:** If you had to go to visit your friends and relatives in Lhasa, did you
                    have to ask for leave or could you just leave and go?   

**A:** If you had to go to Lhasa, then you had to take down your sen and ask for
                    leave. You were not allowed to go without asking for leave.  

**Q:** You had to ask for leave if you were a new monk right?  

**A:** Yes.  

**Q:** If you were a senior monk, then you had to tell the khamtsen gegen that
                    you were going, right?  

**A:** If you were a senior monk, you just had to tell the khamtsen gegen that
                    you were going to Lhasa.  

**Q:**  When you were saying the senior monks didn't need to ask for leave to go
                    to Lhasa, that meant that you were the meeting members or the khamtsen gegen,
                    right?  

**A:**  Mostly, with one's turn for the khamtsen gegen, you could do it by
                    yourself, or if you wanted to skip doing the khamtsen gegen, you could then pay
                    some money to the other monks to do the khamtsen gegen.  

**Q:**  Could you ask for leave from doing the nyerpa?  

**A:**  You definitely didn't have to do the nyerpa. You could also buy the
                    nyerpa.  

**Q:**  They didn't have to do the nyerpa?  

**A:**  Yes. They could buy the nyerpa because it was not compulsory for every
                    monk to do the nyerpa.  

**Q:**  How did you know whether or not you had to do the nyerpa so long as
                    everyone did not need to do the nyerpa?  

**A:**  This was like, if you were not capable of doing the nyerpa, and if you
                    were sick, then you didn't have to do the nyerpa. I think they would get leave
                    from the meeting.  

**Q:**  You didn't have to ask for leave from doing nyerpa?  

**A:**  No, you didn't have to ask for leave.  

**Q:**  How did they appoint the nyerpa? Did they say this and that monks have
                    to do the nyerpa, or how did they appoint the nyerpa?  

**A:**  Normally, it went by order of monks, and as for the monks who didn't
                    want to be the nyerpa, when their turn came for the nyerpa, the monk would
                    disappear for a year and would come back when the period was over.  

**Q:**  Did some people want to be the nyerpa and some people not want to be the
                    nyerpa?  

**A:**  Yes, they were people like that.  

**Q:**  What was the difference? Why would some people want to be the
                    nyerpa?  

**A:**  Because if there were meetings, they had to cook in the khamtsen, so the
                    nyerpa would get the same food as the meeting members. Therefore they wanted to
                    do the nyerpa.  

**Q:**  Were these people also hoping for a high post in the monastery, like the
                    [senior] [Tib. bgres pa]?  

**A:**  Yes, they probably were hoping to get a high post. First, they had to do
                    the nyerpa and the doma [Tib. mdo ma]. After that, you then became the meeting
                    member and if you did well, then you would become the chandzö of the khamtsen.
                    When you become the chandzö, then you had to keep many keys and you were in
                    charge of the tea and butter in the storeroom.  

**Q:**  How many chandzös were there?  

**A:**  In the Lumbum Khamtsen, there was only one chandzö. The khamtsen gegen
                    and the nyerpa would become like a leader [Tib. dpon po]. The khamtsen gegen
                    would look after the discipline and the chandzö would check whether the monks
                    would go to the dharma grove or not.   

**Q:**  How did they appoint the chandzö?  

**A:**  I think the chandzö was appointed by the senior monks through their
                    discussion among the meeting members.  

**Q:**  The chandzö was for one year or was it unlimited?  

**A:**  The chandzö was for two or three years. When the nyerpa was using the
                    butter, the chandzö would stand there watching and the chandzö would make a mark
                    on the butter in order to prevent the nyerpa from cutting more butter. For the
                    tsampa they would put a seal on the sack.  

**Q:**  If they touched it or moved it, then they were finished?  

**A:**  Yes [laughter].  

**Q:**  So during these first years before you were in Labrang, did you stay in
                    the monastery the whole time or did you go somewhere else?  

**A:**  I had to stay in the monastery the whole time because I had to look
                    after the young lama. I thought of going for a pilgrimage to Samye [Tib. bsam
                    yas] but I couldn't go.  

**Q:**  No, what I meant to say was before the lama came?  

**A:**  I couldn't go either before or after the lama came. I stayed in Drepung
                    the whole time.  

**Q:**  You were staying in the monastery the whole time?  

**A:**  I went to the dharma grove to join the class, so I felt happy.  

**Q:**  You were a single monk, so how did you manage yourself, like fetching
                    water, milling the tsampa etc?  

**A:**  I could buy ready-made tsampa, flour, butter, and tea. We would buy the
                    things when we got alms and salary from the tratsang.  

**Q:**  What about the water?  

**A:**  I would go myself to fetch the water and after the first few times, I
                    had broken the clay water bucket. Later, there were junior people coming and I
                    asked them to help me fetch the water.  

**Q:**  Did you eat a lot of meat in the first year or just a little?  

**A:**  I am crazy for meat. But I couldn't afford to buy meat because for one
                    trangga garpo, we would get a very small piece of meat. But I bought a lot of
                    square lumps of blood. And I put blood in tsampa and made soup. Also there were
                    already cooked heads and feet of animals which we were not allowed to buy
                    according to the rule. This rule was just for not losing money. When we bought
                    the head and feet of the animals which I mentioned above, we had to go through
                    the back door of the khamtsen. If we went through the normal door, the khamtsen
                    gegen would see us and he would beat us up.  

**Q:**  Why were you not allowed to eat the feet and head? Was there any
                    reason?  

**A:**  Because if we bought these things, we would lose the money.  

**Q:**  What about the butter?  

**A:**  The butter was very expensive.  

**Q:**  Between, the meat and butter, which was more expensive?  

**A:**  The butter was the most expensive. For the first year, I never had
                    butter tea unless some one gave it to me.  

**Q:**  In that case, why didn't more monks go to the mangja and traja where
                    they would get butter in tea?  

**A:**  That was because in the morning the monks felt more lazy and to get up
                    was very difficult. Therefore, the monks were going late for the mangja. Even
                    though they would call the monks to go to the mangja and traja, and they would
                    hit them with the key, only some of them would go. I would go to the mangja.
                    Except the dharma grove, they didn't need to leave the gown there and it was not
                    compulsory to go to the mangja. So they didn't move. [455] [END OF THE SIDE A]
