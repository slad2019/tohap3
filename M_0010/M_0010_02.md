**Q:** The life style of the monastery wouldn’t be the same every day. For example, sometimes you had to go to fetch water, and sometimes you had to make a fire. And sometimes you had to go to class and the chöra. So there were many things going on so tell us something about the daily activities of the monks with examples?  

**A:** The ordinary monks should have gotten up early in the morning and have done the three prostrations. And they should have said "Please forgive me if I do anything wrong." Then they had to pray the taking refuge, the [Tib. སྐྱབ་འགྲོ]. In Sera, Drepung and in Ganden, they would pray the Ganden Lhagya [Tib. དགའ་ལྡན་ལྷ་བརྒྱ] and from the Lam rim [Tib. ལམ་རིམ] they would pray the Yönden Shigyurma [Tib. ཡོན་ཏན་གཞི་གྱུར་མ]. This was the morning routine.  

**Q:** How long would it take?  

**A:** It would just take half an hour. If there was <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. ཚོམ་ཇ] The name of the khamtsen&#x27;s prayer assembly meetings at which tea was served.">tsomja</span>, then we should have gone to join the tsomja. If there was <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. མང་ཇ] The morning tea served to monks from all the monastic colleges at the main prayer assembly hall.">mangja</span> in Drepung Tsogchen, then the young monks would shout a signal that there was mangja. If you went to mangja there was tea and <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. རྩམ་པ] The traditional Tibetan staple food that consists of grain that is roasted (popped), usually in sand, and then ground into a flour.">tsampa</span> served.  

**Q:** Was there <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. ཚོམ་ཇ] The name of the khamtsen&#x27;s prayer assembly meetings at which tea was served.">tsomja</span> before the <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. མང་ཇ] The morning tea served to monks from all the monastic colleges at the main prayer assembly hall.">mangja</span>?

After finishing the mangja, then the tsomja would begin. Sometimes, the tsomja could be carried on for the whole day and there were 3-4 sessions. When went go to tsomja you had to take your own <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. རྩམ་པ] The traditional Tibetan staple food that consists of grain that is roasted (popped), usually in sand, and then ground into a flour.">tsampa</span>, and you would get the tea in the assembly.

Sometimes, there was also salary or alms given. In the [dharma grove] session time, in Lumbum [Tib. ཀླུ་འབུམ] Khamtsen, they would beat a big iron key like a gong. When they beat the key, all the new monks should have left [their] monk’s cloak [Tib. ཟླ་གམ] and hat, and the <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. ཁང་ཚན་དགེ་རྒན] The head official of a khamtsen.">khamtsen gegen</span> would come to check whether they had left the gown and the hat nicely.

**Q:** Did you make fire in the morning or not?  

**A:** If there was no <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. མང་ཇ] The morning tea served to monks from all the monastic colleges at the main prayer assembly hall.">mangja</span> or <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. ཚོམ་ཇ] The name of the khamtsen&#x27;s prayer assembly meetings at which tea was served.">tsomja</span>, then we had to make a fire in the <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. 1. ཤག, 2. ཞག] 1.

If the tea had been made with a lot of butter, this layer could be thick enough to scoop off and save to later sell or eat separately. The senior monks are usually served tea with a lot of shag.">shag</span> and make tea. If there was mangja, then we didn’t have to make a fire in the shag.  

**Q:** Where did you get the fuel? Did you have to buy the fuel?  

**A:** We had to buy the cow dung for the fuel. After finishing the afternoon <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. chöra (ཆོས་ར)] The walled-in grove in monasteries (monastic colleges) where monks go to study/practice debating.">dharma grove</span>, [then you would go to] the <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. ཉིན་ཆོས] A mid-day study session in monasteries.">nyinchö</span>, which was the more elaborated than the morning session <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. ཞོགས་ཆོས] The morning chöra (debating) session.">shogchö</span>, where you go to individual debates by the individual monks, and they combine together and say few prayers.

A type of monastic debate where two or three monks sit while others stand and ask them questions.">thamja</span>, which was [when] the senior ones would debate with [the] junior ones.

A wild sweet potato.">Droma</span> [Tib. སྒྲོལ་མ], which is the Tara Puja. [In] The beginning of the semester we would do the prayer 21 Tara Puja, and after that it would increase to 12 Droma Puja every day. And at the end of the month, an additional 16 Tara Puja would go and on top of that, we had to pray the short Heart Sutra and the prayer of lion faced dakini, the [Tib. སེང་གདོང་མ]. After that, we had to debate. We had to remain in the dharma grove until 9-10 p.m.  

**Q:** If there was <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. ཚོམ་ཇ] The name of the khamtsen&#x27;s prayer assembly meetings at which tea was served.">tsomja</span>, when would they hold it?  

**A:** Normally if there was <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. ཚོམ་ཇ] The name of the khamtsen&#x27;s prayer assembly meetings at which tea was served.">tsomja</span>, that would come after the afternoon session. Sometimes, if there were important rituals, like somebody specifically requested to do it, then the <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. ཁང་ཚན] A monastic residential unit in which monks from specific geographic areas lived. These were corporate entities with property and internal officials. Some large khamtsen had smaller subordinate units called mi tshan. Khamtsen were part of tratsang (colleges).

So in that case, after the general meeting, the kurim, they would also skip the debate and they would have the tsomja.  

**Q:** If you had to go to visit your friends and relatives in Lhasa, did you have to ask for leave or could you just leave and go?   

**A:** If you had to go to Lhasa, then you had to take down your <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. གཟན] The upper part of a monk&#x27;s dress.">sen</span> and ask for leave. You were not allowed to go without asking for leave.  

**Q:** You had to ask for leave if you were a new monk right?  

**A:** Yes.  

**Q:** If you were a senior monk, then you had to tell the <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. ཁང་ཚན་དགེ་རྒན] The head official of a khamtsen.">khamtsen gegen</span> that you were going, right?  

**A:** If you were a senior monk, you just had to tell the <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. ཁང་ཚན་དགེ་རྒན] The head official of a khamtsen.">khamtsen gegen</span> that you were going to Lhasa.  

**Q:**  When you were saying the senior monks didn't need to ask for leave to go to Lhasa, that meant that you were the meeting members or the <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. ཁང་ཚན་དགེ་རྒན] The head official of a khamtsen.">khamtsen gegen</span>, right?  

**A:**  Mostly, with one's turn for the <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. ཁང་ཚན་དགེ་རྒན] The head official of a khamtsen.">khamtsen gegen</span>, you could do it by yourself, or if you wanted to skip doing the khamtsen gegen, you could then pay some money to the other monks to do the khamtsen gegen.  

**Q:**  Could you ask for leave from doing the <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. གཉེར་པ] A steward or manager. In some monasteries, the nyerpa was in charge of storerooms under the authority of a higher manager called a chandzö.">nyerpa</span>?  

**A:**  You definitely didn't have to do the nyerpa. You could also buy the nyerpa.  

**Q:**  They didn't have to do the <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. གཉེར་པ] A steward or manager. In some monasteries, the nyerpa was in charge of storerooms under the authority of a higher manager called a chandzö.">nyerpa</span>?  

**A:**  Yes. They could buy the <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. གཉེར་པ] A steward or manager. In some monasteries, the nyerpa was in charge of storerooms under the authority of a higher manager called a chandzö.">nyerpa</span> because it was not compulsory for every monk to do the nyerpa.  

**Q:**  How did you know whether or not you had to do the <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. གཉེར་པ] A steward or manager. In some monasteries, the nyerpa was in charge of storerooms under the authority of a higher manager called a chandzö.">nyerpa</span> so long as everyone did not need to do the nyerpa?  

**A:**  This was like, if you were not capable of doing the <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. གཉེར་པ] A steward or manager. In some monasteries, the nyerpa was in charge of storerooms under the authority of a higher manager called a chandzö.">nyerpa</span>, and if you were sick, then you didn't have to do the nyerpa. I think they would get leave from the meeting.  

**Q:**  You didn't have to ask for leave from doing <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. གཉེར་པ] A steward or manager. In some monasteries, the nyerpa was in charge of storerooms under the authority of a higher manager called a chandzö.">nyerpa</span>?  

**A:**  No, you didn't have to ask for leave.  

**Q:**  How did they appoint the <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. གཉེར་པ] A steward or manager. In some monasteries, the nyerpa was in charge of storerooms under the authority of a higher manager called a chandzö.">nyerpa</span>? Did they say this and that monks have to do the nyerpa, or how did they appoint the nyerpa?  

**A:**  Normally, it went by order of monks, and as for the monks who didn't want to be the <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. གཉེར་པ] A steward or manager. In some monasteries, the nyerpa was in charge of storerooms under the authority of a higher manager called a chandzö.">nyerpa</span>, when their turn came for the nyerpa, the monk would disappear for a year and would come back when the period was over.  

**Q:**  Did some people want to be the <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. གཉེར་པ] A steward or manager. In some monasteries, the nyerpa was in charge of storerooms under the authority of a higher manager called a chandzö.">nyerpa</span> and some people not want to be the nyerpa?  

**A:**  Yes, they were people like that.  

**Q:**  What was the difference? Why would some people want to be the <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. གཉེར་པ] A steward or manager. In some monasteries, the nyerpa was in charge of storerooms under the authority of a higher manager called a chandzö.">nyerpa</span>?  

**A:**  Because if there were meetings, they had to cook in the <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. ཁང་ཚན] A monastic residential unit in which monks from specific geographic areas lived. These were corporate entities with property and internal officials. Some large khamtsen had smaller subordinate units called mi tshan. Khamtsen were part of tratsang (colleges). For example, Hamdong Khamtsen was part of Gomang College in Drepung Monastery.">khamtsen</span>, so the <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. གཉེར་པ] A steward or manager. In some monasteries, the nyerpa was in charge of storerooms under the authority of a higher manager called a chandzö.">nyerpa</span> would get the same food as the meeting members. Therefore they wanted to do the nyerpa.  

**Q:**  Were these people also hoping for a high post in the monastery, like the [senior] [Tib. བགྲེས་པ]?  

**A:**  Yes, they probably were hoping to get a high post. First, they had to do the <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. གཉེར་པ] A steward or manager. In some monasteries, the nyerpa was in charge of storerooms under the authority of a higher manager called a chandzö.">nyerpa</span> and the doma [Tib. མདོ་མ]. After that, you then became the meeting member and if you did well, then you would become the <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. ཕྱག་མཛོད] A senior manager/treasurer of an aristocratic or monastic estate, or the senior manager/treasurer of an aristocratic family or a monastic unit. Generally chandzö handled both internal and external issues and were considered higher in power and status than nyerpa (stewards), who typically only handled the storerooms.">chandzö</span> of the khamtsen. When you become the chandzö, then you had to keep many keys and you were in charge of the tea and butter in the storeroom.  

**Q:**  How many chandzös were there?  

**A:**  In the Lumbum Khamtsen, there was only one <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. ཕྱག་མཛོད] A senior manager/treasurer of an aristocratic or monastic estate, or the senior manager/treasurer of an aristocratic family or a monastic unit. Generally chandzö handled both internal and external issues and were considered higher in power and status than nyerpa (stewards), who typically only handled the storerooms.">chandzö</span>. The <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. ཁང་ཚན་དགེ་རྒན] The head official of a khamtsen.">khamtsen gegen</span> and the <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. གཉེར་པ] A steward or manager. In some monasteries, the nyerpa was in charge of storerooms under the authority of a higher manager called a chandzö.">nyerpa</span> would become like a leader [Tib. དཔོན་པོ]. The khamtsen gegen would look after the discipline and the chandzö would check whether the monks would go to the <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. chöra (ཆོས་ར)] The walled-in grove in monasteries (monastic colleges) where monks go to study/practice debating.">dharma grove</span> or not.   

**Q:**  How did they appoint the <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. ཕྱག་མཛོད] A senior manager/treasurer of an aristocratic or monastic estate, or the senior manager/treasurer of an aristocratic family or a monastic unit. Generally chandzö handled both internal and external issues and were considered higher in power and status than nyerpa (stewards), who typically only handled the storerooms.">chandzö</span>?  

**A:**  I think the <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. ཕྱག་མཛོད] A senior manager/treasurer of an aristocratic or monastic estate, or the senior manager/treasurer of an aristocratic family or a monastic unit. Generally chandzö handled both internal and external issues and were considered higher in power and status than nyerpa (stewards), who typically only handled the storerooms.">chandzö</span> was appointed by the senior monks through their discussion among the meeting members.  

**Q:**  The <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. ཕྱག་མཛོད] A senior manager/treasurer of an aristocratic or monastic estate, or the senior manager/treasurer of an aristocratic family or a monastic unit. Generally chandzö handled both internal and external issues and were considered higher in power and status than nyerpa (stewards), who typically only handled the storerooms.">chandzö</span> was for one year or was it unlimited?  

**A:**  The <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. ཕྱག་མཛོད] A senior manager/treasurer of an aristocratic or monastic estate, or the senior manager/treasurer of an aristocratic family or a monastic unit. Generally chandzö handled both internal and external issues and were considered higher in power and status than nyerpa (stewards), who typically only handled the storerooms.">chandzö</span> was for two or three years. When the <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. གཉེར་པ] A steward or manager. In some monasteries, the nyerpa was in charge of storerooms under the authority of a higher manager called a chandzö.">nyerpa</span> was using the butter, the chandzö would stand there watching and the chandzö would make a mark on the butter in order to prevent the nyerpa from cutting more butter. For the <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. རྩམ་པ] The traditional Tibetan staple food that consists of grain that is roasted (popped), usually in sand, and then ground into a flour.">tsampa</span> they would put a seal on the sack.  

**Q:**  If they touched it or moved it, then they were finished?  

**A:**  Yes [laughter].  

**Q:**  So during these first years before you were in Labrang, did you stay in the monastery the whole time or did you go somewhere else?  

**A:**  I had to stay in the monastery the whole time because I had to look after the young lama. I thought of going for a pilgrimage to Samye [Tib. བསམ་ཡས] but I couldn't go.  

**Q:**  No, what I meant to say was before the lama came?  

**A:**  I couldn't go either before or after the lama came. I stayed in Drepung the whole time.  

**Q:**  You were staying in the monastery the whole time?  

**A:**  I went to the <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. chöra (ཆོས་ར)] The walled-in grove in monasteries (monastic colleges) where monks go to study/practice debating.">dharma grove</span> to join the class, so I felt happy.  

**Q:**  You were a single monk, so how did you manage yourself, like fetching water, milling the <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. རྩམ་པ] The traditional Tibetan staple food that consists of grain that is roasted (popped), usually in sand, and then ground into a flour.">tsampa</span> etc?  

**A:**  I could buy ready-made <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. རྩམ་པ] The traditional Tibetan staple food that consists of grain that is roasted (popped), usually in sand, and then ground into a flour.">tsampa</span>, flour, butter, and tea. We would buy the things when we got alms and salary from the tratsang.  

**Q:**  What about the water?  

**A:**  I would go myself to fetch the water and after the first few times, I had broken the clay water bucket. Later, there were junior people coming and I asked them to help me fetch the water.  

**Q:**  Did you eat a lot of meat in the first year or just a little?  

**A:**  I am crazy for meat. But I couldn't afford to buy meat because for one <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. ཏམ་ཀ་དཀར་པོ] A unit in the traditional Tibetan currency system that was equal to 4 sang. Also a silver coin.">trangga garpo</span>, we would get a very small piece of meat. But I bought a lot of square lumps of blood. And I put blood in <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. རྩམ་པ] The traditional Tibetan staple food that consists of grain that is roasted (popped), usually in sand, and then ground into a flour.">tsampa</span> and made soup. Also there were already cooked heads and feet of animals which we were not allowed to buy according to the rule. This rule was just for not losing money. When we bought the head and feet of the animals which I mentioned above, we had to go through the back door of the khamtsen. If we went through the normal door, the <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. ཁང་ཚན་དགེ་རྒན] The head official of a khamtsen.">khamtsen gegen</span> would see us and he would beat us up.  

**Q:**  Why were you not allowed to eat the feet and head? Was there any reason?  

**A:**  Because if we bought these things, we would lose the money.  

**Q:**  What about the butter?  

**A:**  The butter was very expensive.  

**Q:**  Between, the meat and butter, which was more expensive?  

**A:**  The butter was the most expensive. For the first year, I never had butter tea unless some one gave it to me.  

**Q:**  In that case, why didn't more monks go to the <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. མང་ཇ] The morning tea served to monks from all the monastic colleges at the main prayer assembly hall.">mangja</span> and <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. གྲྭ་ཇ] The prayer session sponsored by the tratsang (college) at which tea was served to its monks who attended.">traja</span> where they would get butter in tea?  

**A:**  That was because in the morning the monks felt more lazy and to get up was very difficult. Therefore, the monks were going late for the <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. མང་ཇ] The morning tea served to monks from all the monastic colleges at the main prayer assembly hall.">mangja</span>. Even though they would call the monks to go to the mangja and <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. གྲྭ་ཇ] The prayer session sponsored by the tratsang (college) at which tea was served to its monks who attended.">traja</span>, and they would hit them with the key, only some of them would go. I would go to the mangja. Except the <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. chöra (ཆོས་ར)] The walled-in grove in monasteries (monastic colleges) where monks go to study/practice debating.">dharma grove</span>, they didn't need to leave the gown there and it was not compulsory to go to the mangja. So they didn't move. [455] [END OF THE SIDE A]
