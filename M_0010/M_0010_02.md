**Q:** The life style of the monastery wouldn’t be the same every day. For example, sometimes you had to go to fetch water, and sometimes you had to make a fire. And sometimes you had to go to class and the chöra. So there were many things going on so tell us something about the daily activities of the monks with examples?  

**A:** The ordinary monks should have gotten up early in the morning and have done the three prostrations. And they should have said "Please forgive me if I do anything wrong." Then they had to pray the taking refuge, the [Tib. སྐྱབ་འགྲོ]. In Sera, Drepung and in Ganden, they would pray the Ganden Lhagya [Tib. དགའ་ལྡན་ལྷ་བརྒྱ] and from the Lam rim [Tib. ལམ་རིམ] they would pray the Yönden Shigyurma [Tib. ཡོན་ཏན་གཞི་གྱུར་མ]. This was the morning routine.  

**Q:** How long would it take?  

**A:** It would just take half an hour. If there was <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཚོམ་ཇ] The name of the khamtsen&#x27;s prayer assembly meetings at which tea was served.">tsomja</a>, then we should have gone to join the tsomja. If there was <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. མང་ཇ] The morning tea served to monks from all the monastic colleges at the main prayer assembly hall.">mangja</a> in Drepung Tsogchen, then the young monks would shout a signal that there was mangja. If you went to mangja there was tea and <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. རྩམ་པ] The traditional Tibetan staple food that consists of grain that is roasted (popped), usually in sand, and then ground into a flour.">tsampa</a> served.  

**Q:** Was there <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཚོམ་ཇ] The name of the khamtsen&#x27;s prayer assembly meetings at which tea was served.">tsomja</a> before the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. མང་ཇ] The morning tea served to monks from all the monastic colleges at the main prayer assembly hall.">mangja</a>?  

**A:** I don’t think there was <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཚོམ་ཇ] The name of the khamtsen&#x27;s prayer assembly meetings at which tea was served.">tsomja</a> before <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. མང་ཇ] The morning tea served to monks from all the monastic colleges at the main prayer assembly hall.">mangja</a>. After finishing the mangja, then the tsomja would begin. Sometimes, the tsomja could be carried on for the whole day and there were 3-4 sessions. When went go to tsomja you had to take your own <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. རྩམ་པ] The traditional Tibetan staple food that consists of grain that is roasted (popped), usually in sand, and then ground into a flour.">tsampa</a>, and you would get the tea in the assembly. You have to do w<a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཞྭ་མོ; ch. 戴帽] 1. A regular hat, cap. 2. A common political slang term (label) used for people who were classified as class enemies or reactionaries. It was used politically as, &quot;They put the hat on him,&quot; or &quot;They never took his hat off.&quot;">hat</a>ever prayer [was] requested by the sponsor. Sometimes, there was also salary or alms given. In the [dharma grove] session time, in Lumbum [Tib. ཀླུ་འབུམ] Khamtsen, they would beat a big iron key like a gong. When they beat the key, all the new monks should have left [their] monk’s cloak [Tib. ཟླ་གམ] and hat, and the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཁང་ཚན་དགེ་རྒན] The head official of a khamtsen.">khamtsen gegen</a> would come to check whether they had left the gown and the hat nicely.  

**Q:** You had to leave your gown when you went to <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཆོས་ར] The special grove (&quot;dharma grove&quot;) in monasteries where monks formally met to practice debating.">chöra</a> in the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. གྲྭ་ཚང] A &quot;college&quot; within a monastery, for example, in Drepung Monastery there were four main tratsang: Gomang, Loseling, Deyang and Ngagpa. These tratsang were property owning corporate entities and included monks who were organized into residential dormitories called Khamtsen.">tratsang</a>?  

**A:** Yes, you had to leave it in the courtyard of the common house, jikhang [Tib. སྤྱི་ཁང] in the khamtsen.  

**Q:** So who would look after the gown? Was it the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཁང་ཚན་དགེ་རྒན] The head official of a khamtsen.">khamtsen gegen</a>?  

**A:** The <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཁང་ཚན་དགེ་རྒན] The head official of a khamtsen.">khamtsen gegen</a> would look after the gown if we went to the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. chöra (ཆོས་ར)] The walled-in grove in monasteries (monastic colleges) where monks go to study/practice debating.">dharma grove</a> in the morning. In <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. སྒོ་མང] One of the large colleges in Drepung Monastery.">Gomang</a>, every semester, which is known as <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཆོས་ཐོག] A monastic &quot;academic semester.&quot; A period of studying/debating in the monastic curriculum that is something like a term or semester. A period of time when monks were engaged in formal studying. There were eight chöthog in a year: the autumn chöthog (tönchö [tib. སྟོན་ཆོས]) was for one month, the summer chöthog (yarchö [tib. དབྱར་ཆོས]) was for one month, the winter chöthog (günchö [tib. དགུན་ཆོས]) was for one month, and the spring chöthog (jichö [tib. དཔྱིད་ཆོས]) was for one month. Then there were also two monthly chöra called dachö [tib. ཟླ་ཆོས] and two 15 day chöra called jönga chöra [tib. བཅོ་ལྔ་ཆོས་ར].">chöthog</a> for the first three days, they had to read the shortest text of Pargyaparamita [Tib. བརྒྱད་སྟོང] in the morning session in the chöra.

These tratsang were property owning corporate entities and included monks who were organized into residential dormitories called Khamtsen.">tratsang</a>?  

**A:** Yes, then they would pray the text call Jambey Tsenjö [Tib. འཇམ་དཔལ་མཚན་བརྗོད] in the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཆོས་ར] The special grove (&quot;dharma grove&quot;) in monasteries where monks formally met to practice debating.">chöra</a> every day.

**A:** Yes, then they would pray the Sherab Nyingppo [Tib. ཤེས་རབ་སྙིང་པོ] also.  

**Q:** Was there enough time for praying Jambey Tsenjö?   

**A:** It would take a long time for the morning session and then the abbot would check the monks.   

**Q:** So at the morning session would the abbot check the monks?  

**A:** Sometimes he would and sometimes not. After that, the monks would pray some <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. 1. སྒྲོལ་མ, 2. གྲོ་མ] 1. The goddess Tara. 2. A woman&#x27;s name. 3. A wild sweet potato.">Droma</a> prayer and when the morning session was over, the monks would start the debate in the grades. After that, if there was afternoon <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. མང་ཇ] The morning tea served to monks from all the monastic colleges at the main prayer assembly hall.">mangja</a> in the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཚོགས་ཆེན] The main assembly hall of a monastery.

The <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. དགེ་སྐོས] The main disciplinary official in a monastic college (tratsang).">gegö</a> would clap his hands, which indicated the morning session was over. After that, each and [every] individual class would start. From karam [Tib. bk’a ram] grade the two monks would come and ask question to each class.

**Q:** If you didn’t feel like going to the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. chöra (ཆོས་ར)] The walled-in grove in monasteries (monastic colleges) where monks go to study/practice debating.">dharma grove</a>, then you didn't have to go, right?  

**A:** If you didn't want to go to the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. chöra (ཆོས་ར)] The walled-in grove in monasteries (monastic colleges) where monks go to study/practice debating.">dharma grove</a>, you could pick [up] your gown and <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཞྭ་མོ; ch. 戴帽] 1. A regular hat, cap. 2. A common political slang term (label) used for people who were classified as class enemies or reactionaries.

And you had to close your door from inside as if you went to the dharma grove. In Lumbum, the discipline was very strict. In other <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཁང་ཚན] A monastic residential unit in which monks from specific geographic areas lived. These were corporate entities with property and internal officials. Some large khamtsen had smaller subordinate units called mi tshan. Khamtsen were part of tratsang (colleges).

**Q:**  In the Lumbum were there monks who didn't study <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. མཚན་ཉིད] Buddhist dialectics. This is taught after the six-year curriculum called düdra.">tsenyi</a>?  

**A:** Yes, there were many monks who didn't study <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. མཚན་ཉིད] Buddhist dialectics. This is taught after the six-year curriculum called düdra.">tsenyi</a>. Every monk should put [down] the cloak, <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཟླ་གམ] The cloak monks wear at the prayer assembly sessions.">dagam</a>, whether you studied tsenyi or not.  

**Q:** What do you mean by <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཟླ་གམ] The cloak monks wear at the prayer assembly sessions.">dagam</a>?  

**A:** The <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཟླ་གམ] The cloak monks wear at the prayer assembly sessions.">dagam</a> is like an gown without sleeves. The monks who were good in <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. མཚན་ཉིད] Buddhist dialectics. This is taught after the six-year curriculum called düdra.">tsenyi</a> had to go to receive the teaching. In the afternoon, we had to go to the dharma grove.  

**Q:** Did you make fire in the morning or not?  

**A:** If there was no <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. མང་ཇ] The morning tea served to monks from all the monastic colleges at the main prayer assembly hall.">mangja</a> or <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཚོམ་ཇ] The name of the khamtsen&#x27;s prayer assembly meetings at which tea was served.">tsomja</a>, then we had to make a fire in the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. 1. ཤག, 2. ཞག] 1. The apartment/room of a monk. 2. The butter fat that coagulates on the top of butter-tea when the tea is left to sit for some time. If the tea had been made with a lot of butter, this layer could be thick enough to scoop off and save to later sell or eat separately. The senior monks are usually served tea with a lot of shag.">shag</a> and make tea. If there was mangja, then we didn’t have to make a fire in the shag.  

**Q:** Where did you get the fuel? Did you have to buy the fuel?  

**A:** We had to buy the cow dung for the fuel. After finishing the afternoon <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. chöra (ཆོས་ར)] The walled-in grove in monasteries (monastic colleges) where monks go to study/practice debating.">dharma grove</a>, [then you would go to] the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཉིན་ཆོས] A mid-day study session in monasteries.">nyinchö</a>, which was the more elaborated than the morning session <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཞོགས་ཆོས] The morning chöra (debating) session.">shogchö</a>, where you go to individual debates by the individual monks, and they combine together and say few prayers. After that, we would have a group meeting that we called <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. དམ་བཅའ] 1. An oath, promise. 2. A type of monastic debate where two or three monks sit while others stand and ask them questions.">thamja</a>, which was [when] the senior ones would debate with [the] junior ones. When the evening session started with the prayer session, we had to pray <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. 1. སྒྲོལ་མ, 2. གྲོ་མ] 1. The goddess Tara. 2. A woman&#x27;s name. 3. A wild sweet potato.">Droma</a> [Tib. སྒྲོལ་མ], which is the Tara Puja. [In] The beginning of the semester we would do the prayer 21 Tara Puja, and after that it would increase to 12 Droma Puja every day. And at the end of the month, an additional 16 Tara Puja would go and on top of that, we had to pray the short Heart Sutra and the prayer of lion faced dakini, the [Tib. སེང་གདོང་མ]. After that, we had to debate. We had to remain in the dharma grove until 9-10 p.m.  

**Q:** If there was <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཚོམ་ཇ] The name of the khamtsen&#x27;s prayer assembly meetings at which tea was served.">tsomja</a>, when would they hold it?  

**A:** Normally if there was <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཚོམ་ཇ] The name of the khamtsen&#x27;s prayer assembly meetings at which tea was served.">tsomja</a>, that would come after the afternoon session. Sometimes, if there were important rituals, like somebody specifically requested to do it, then the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཁང་ཚན] A monastic residential unit in which monks from specific geographic areas lived. These were corporate entities with property and internal officials. Some large khamtsen had smaller subordinate units called mi tshan. Khamtsen were part of tratsang (colleges). For example, Hamdong Khamtsen was part of Gomang College in Drepung Monastery.">khamtsen</a> would inform [us] to come to tsomja right after the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. སྐུ་རིམ] A religious prayer service for monks.">kurim</a>, which was the evening prayer. So in that case, after the general meeting, the kurim, they would also skip the debate and they would have the tsomja.  

**Q:** If you had to go to visit your friends and relatives in Lhasa, did you have to ask for leave or could you just leave and go?   

**A:** If you had to go to Lhasa, then you had to take down your <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. གཟན] The upper part of a monk&#x27;s dress.">sen</a> and ask for leave. You were not allowed to go without asking for leave.  

**Q:** You had to ask for leave if you were a new monk right?  

**A:** Yes.  

**Q:** If you were a senior monk, then you had to tell the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཁང་ཚན་དགེ་རྒན] The head official of a khamtsen.">khamtsen gegen</a> that you were going, right?  

**A:** If you were a senior monk, you just had to tell the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཁང་ཚན་དགེ་རྒན] The head official of a khamtsen.">khamtsen gegen</a> that you were going to Lhasa.  

**Q:**  When you were saying the senior monks didn't need to ask for leave to go to Lhasa, that meant that you were the meeting members or the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཁང་ཚན་དགེ་རྒན] The head official of a khamtsen.">khamtsen gegen</a>, right?  

**A:**  Mostly, with one's turn for the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཁང་ཚན་དགེ་རྒན] The head official of a khamtsen.">khamtsen gegen</a>, you could do it by yourself, or if you wanted to skip doing the khamtsen gegen, you could then pay some money to the other monks to do the khamtsen gegen.  

**Q:**  Could you ask for leave from doing the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. གཉེར་པ] A steward or manager. In some monasteries, the nyerpa was in charge of storerooms under the authority of a higher manager called a chandzö.">nyerpa</a>?  

**A:**  You definitely didn't have to do the nyerpa. You could also buy the nyerpa.  

**Q:**  They didn't have to do the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. གཉེར་པ] A steward or manager. In some monasteries, the nyerpa was in charge of storerooms under the authority of a higher manager called a chandzö.">nyerpa</a>?  

**A:**  Yes. They could buy the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. གཉེར་པ] A steward or manager. In some monasteries, the nyerpa was in charge of storerooms under the authority of a higher manager called a chandzö.">nyerpa</a> because it was not compulsory for every monk to do the nyerpa.  

**Q:**  How did you know whether or not you had to do the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. གཉེར་པ] A steward or manager. In some monasteries, the nyerpa was in charge of storerooms under the authority of a higher manager called a chandzö.">nyerpa</a> so long as everyone did not need to do the nyerpa?  

**A:**  This was like, if you were not capable of doing the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. གཉེར་པ] A steward or manager. In some monasteries, the nyerpa was in charge of storerooms under the authority of a higher manager called a chandzö.">nyerpa</a>, and if you were sick, then you didn't have to do the nyerpa. I think they would get leave from the meeting.  

**Q:**  You didn't have to ask for leave from doing <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. གཉེར་པ] A steward or manager. In some monasteries, the nyerpa was in charge of storerooms under the authority of a higher manager called a chandzö.">nyerpa</a>?  

**A:**  No, you didn't have to ask for leave.  

**Q:**  How did they appoint the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. གཉེར་པ] A steward or manager. In some monasteries, the nyerpa was in charge of storerooms under the authority of a higher manager called a chandzö.">nyerpa</a>? Did they say this and that monks have to do the nyerpa, or how did they appoint the nyerpa?  

**A:**  Normally, it went by order of monks, and as for the monks who didn't want to be the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. གཉེར་པ] A steward or manager. In some monasteries, the nyerpa was in charge of storerooms under the authority of a higher manager called a chandzö.">nyerpa</a>, when their turn came for the nyerpa, the monk would disappear for a year and would come back when the period was over.  

**Q:**  Did some people want to be the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. གཉེར་པ] A steward or manager. In some monasteries, the nyerpa was in charge of storerooms under the authority of a higher manager called a chandzö.">nyerpa</a> and some people not want to be the nyerpa?  

**A:**  Yes, they were people like that.  

**Q:**  What was the difference? Why would some people want to be the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. གཉེར་པ] A steward or manager. In some monasteries, the nyerpa was in charge of storerooms under the authority of a higher manager called a chandzö.">nyerpa</a>?  

**A:**  Because if there were meetings, they had to cook in the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཁང་ཚན] A monastic residential unit in which monks from specific geographic areas lived. These were corporate entities with property and internal officials. Some large khamtsen had smaller subordinate units called mi tshan. Khamtsen were part of tratsang (colleges). For example, Hamdong Khamtsen was part of Gomang College in Drepung Monastery.">khamtsen</a>, so the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. གཉེར་པ] A steward or manager. In some monasteries, the nyerpa was in charge of storerooms under the authority of a higher manager called a chandzö.">nyerpa</a> would get the same food as the meeting members. Therefore they wanted to do the nyerpa.  

**Q:**  Were these people also hoping for a high post in the monastery, like the [senior] [Tib. བགྲེས་པ]?  

**A:**  Yes, they probably were hoping to get a high post. First, they had to do the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. གཉེར་པ] A steward or manager. In some monasteries, the nyerpa was in charge of storerooms under the authority of a higher manager called a chandzö.">nyerpa</a> and the doma [Tib. མདོ་མ]. After that, you then became the meeting member and if you did well, then you would become the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཕྱག་མཛོད] A senior manager/treasurer of an aristocratic or monastic estate, or the senior manager/treasurer of an aristocratic family or a monastic unit. Generally chandzö handled both internal and external issues and were considered higher in power and status than nyerpa (stewards), who typically only handled the storerooms.">chandzö</a> of the khamtsen. When you become the chandzö, then you had to keep many keys and you were in charge of the tea and butter in the storeroom.  

**Q:**  How many chandzös were there?  

**A:**  In the Lumbum Khamtsen, there was only one <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཕྱག་མཛོད] A senior manager/treasurer of an aristocratic or monastic estate, or the senior manager/treasurer of an aristocratic family or a monastic unit. Generally chandzö handled both internal and external issues and were considered higher in power and status than nyerpa (stewards), who typically only handled the storerooms.">chandzö</a>. The <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཁང་ཚན་དགེ་རྒན] The head official of a khamtsen.">khamtsen gegen</a> and the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. གཉེར་པ] A steward or manager. In some monasteries, the nyerpa was in charge of storerooms under the authority of a higher manager called a chandzö.">nyerpa</a> would become like a leader [Tib. དཔོན་པོ]. The khamtsen gegen would look after the discipline and the chandzö would check whether the monks would go to the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. chöra (ཆོས་ར)] The walled-in grove in monasteries (monastic colleges) where monks go to study/practice debating.">dharma grove</a> or not.   

**Q:**  How did they appoint the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཕྱག་མཛོད] A senior manager/treasurer of an aristocratic or monastic estate, or the senior manager/treasurer of an aristocratic family or a monastic unit. Generally chandzö handled both internal and external issues and were considered higher in power and status than nyerpa (stewards), who typically only handled the storerooms.">chandzö</a>?  

**A:**  I think the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཕྱག་མཛོད] A senior manager/treasurer of an aristocratic or monastic estate, or the senior manager/treasurer of an aristocratic family or a monastic unit. Generally chandzö handled both internal and external issues and were considered higher in power and status than nyerpa (stewards), who typically only handled the storerooms.">chandzö</a> was appointed by the senior monks through their discussion among the meeting members.  

**Q:**  The <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཕྱག་མཛོད] A senior manager/treasurer of an aristocratic or monastic estate, or the senior manager/treasurer of an aristocratic family or a monastic unit. Generally chandzö handled both internal and external issues and were considered higher in power and status than nyerpa (stewards), who typically only handled the storerooms.">chandzö</a> was for one year or was it unlimited?  

**A:**  The <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཕྱག་མཛོད] A senior manager/treasurer of an aristocratic or monastic estate, or the senior manager/treasurer of an aristocratic family or a monastic unit. Generally chandzö handled both internal and external issues and were considered higher in power and status than nyerpa (stewards), who typically only handled the storerooms.">chandzö</a> was for two or three years. When the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. གཉེར་པ] A steward or manager. In some monasteries, the nyerpa was in charge of storerooms under the authority of a higher manager called a chandzö.">nyerpa</a> was using the butter, the chandzö would stand there watching and the chandzö would make a mark on the butter in order to prevent the nyerpa from cutting more butter. For the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. རྩམ་པ] The traditional Tibetan staple food that consists of grain that is roasted (popped), usually in sand, and then ground into a flour.">tsampa</a> they would put a seal on the sack.  

**Q:**  If they touched it or moved it, then they were finished?  

**A:**  Yes [laughter].  

**Q:**  So during these first years before you were in Labrang, did you stay in the monastery the whole time or did you go somewhere else?  

**A:**  I had to stay in the monastery the whole time because I had to look after the young lama. I thought of going for a pilgrimage to Samye [Tib. བསམ་ཡས] but I couldn't go.  

**Q:**  No, what I meant to say was before the lama came?  

**A:**  I couldn't go either before or after the lama came. I stayed in Drepung the whole time.  

**Q:**  You were staying in the monastery the whole time?  

**A:**  I went to the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. chöra (ཆོས་ར)] The walled-in grove in monasteries (monastic colleges) where monks go to study/practice debating.">dharma grove</a> to join the class, so I felt happy.  

**Q:**  You were a single monk, so how did you manage yourself, like fetching water, milling the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. རྩམ་པ] The traditional Tibetan staple food that consists of grain that is roasted (popped), usually in sand, and then ground into a flour.">tsampa</a> etc?  

**A:**  I could buy ready-made <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. རྩམ་པ] The traditional Tibetan staple food that consists of grain that is roasted (popped), usually in sand, and then ground into a flour.">tsampa</a>, flour, butter, and tea. We would buy the things when we got alms and salary from the tratsang.  

**Q:**  What about the water?  

**A:**  I would go myself to fetch the water and after the first few times, I had broken the clay water bucket. Later, there were junior people coming and I asked them to help me fetch the water.  

**Q:**  Did you eat a lot of meat in the first year or just a little?  

**A:**  I am crazy for meat. But I couldn't afford to buy meat because for one <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཏམ་ཀ་དཀར་པོ] A unit in the traditional Tibetan currency system that was equal to 4 sang. Also a silver coin.">trangga garpo</a>, we would get a very small piece of meat. But I bought a lot of square lumps of blood. And I put blood in <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. རྩམ་པ] The traditional Tibetan staple food that consists of grain that is roasted (popped), usually in sand, and then ground into a flour.">tsampa</a> and made soup. Also there were already cooked heads and feet of animals which we were not allowed to buy according to the rule. This rule was just for not losing money. When we bought the head and feet of the animals which I mentioned above, we had to go through the back door of the khamtsen. If we went through the normal door, the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཁང་ཚན་དགེ་རྒན] The head official of a khamtsen.">khamtsen gegen</a> would see us and he would beat us up.  

**Q:**  Why were you not allowed to eat the feet and head? Was there any reason?  

**A:**  Because if we bought these things, we would lose the money.  

**Q:**  What about the butter?  

**A:**  The butter was very expensive.  

**Q:**  Between, the meat and butter, which was more expensive?  

**A:**  The butter was the most expensive. For the first year, I never had butter tea unless some one gave it to me.  

**Q:**  In that case, why didn't more monks go to the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. མང་ཇ] The morning tea served to monks from all the monastic colleges at the main prayer assembly hall.">mangja</a> and <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. གྲྭ་ཇ] The prayer session sponsored by the tratsang (college) at which tea was served to its monks who attended.">traja</a> where they would get butter in tea?  

**A:**  That was because in the morning the monks felt more lazy and to get up was very difficult. Therefore, the monks were going late for the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. མང་ཇ] The morning tea served to monks from all the monastic colleges at the main prayer assembly hall.">mangja</a>. Even though they would call the monks to go to the mangja and <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. གྲྭ་ཇ] The prayer session sponsored by the tratsang (college) at which tea was served to its monks who attended.">traja</a>, and they would hit them with the key, only some of them would go. I would go to the mangja. Except the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. chöra (ཆོས་ར)] The walled-in grove in monasteries (monastic colleges) where monks go to study/practice debating.">dharma grove</a>, they didn't need to leave the gown there and it was not compulsory to go to the mangja. So they didn't move. [455] [END OF THE SIDE A]
