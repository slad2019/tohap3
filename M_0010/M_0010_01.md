**Q:**  Gelek Rimpoche's note: Tagkhare [Tib. སྟག་ཁ་རལ] was a very wealthy <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. ཤག་ཚང] 1. The household or family of a monk that consisted of multiple monks. 2. The apartment of a monk household.">shagtsang</span> in Gomang. He was from Washü [Tib. ཝ་ཤུལ] Mitsen, so anyone who wanted to join Washü went to him. One had to do a lot of work like cleaning and serving when one went to his household, but you didn’t need to worry about your future livelihood.  

**Q:** We heard that in <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. སྒོ་མང] One of the large colleges in Drepung Monastery.">Gomang</span> there was a famous incident where some people in the monastery said that the <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. དཔེ་ཆ་བ] A monk studying the monastic philosophical curriculum. A scholar monk.">pechawa</span> were doing this good work, so the monastery should treat them specially). But some people said they didn’t need to be treated specially because they were in the <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. གྲྭ་ཚང] A &quot;college&quot; within a monastery, for example, in Drepung Monastery there were four main tratsang: Gomang, Loseling, Deyang and Ngagpa. These tratsang were property owning corporate entities and included monks who were organized into residential dormitories called Khamtsen.">tratsang</span> and studying <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. དཔེ་ཆ] Religious books/texts, scriptures.">pecha</span> was their job. There was this kind of trouble.   

**A:**  I don’t know whether the <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. དཔེ་ཆ་བ] A monk studying the monastic philosophical curriculum. A scholar monk.">pechawa</span> said that they wanted to be treated specially, but there was big trouble.   

**Q:**  Were you there in the monastery at that time?  

**A:**  Yes. The big trouble was because of the Mongolian abbot, Khen Rimpoche called Ngawang [Tib. ངག་དབང] something. This Mongolian Khembo said that all the monks in <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. སྒོ་མང] One of the large colleges in Drepung Monastery.">Gomang</span> must come to the <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. ཆོས་ར] The special grove (&quot;dharma grove&quot;) in monasteries where monks formally met to practice debating.">chöra</span>. In Gomang, there were about, more than 4,000 monks. [There was a big traja served in the <span class "tooltip" data-text "[tib. གྲྭ་ཚང] A &quot;college&quot; within a monastery, for example, in Drepung Monastery there were four main tratsang: Gomang, Loseling, Deyang and Ngagpa. These tratsang were property owning corporate entities and included monks who were organized into residential dormitories called Khamtsen.">tratsang</span>=and=the=assembly=hall=couldn’t=hold=them,=and=many=of=them=had=to=sit=outside.] However, in the chöra, there would [normally] only be about 100-200-300-400 monks. So the Khembo said that there was a small number of monks in the chöra, so all the monks must come to the chöra. And to please give alms [Tib. འགྱེད] in the chöra rather than giving alms in the tratsang courtyard (the tratsang gomchor) [as usual], with the monks [who] didn’t need to go to the chöra. They would stand in line [Tib. ཤར་བཀག་བཏང] there. Khen Rimpoche gave a speech in the assembly [Tib. ཚོགས་གཏམ] saying, “From tomorrow, we are going to give alms like one <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. སྲང] A unit of traditional Tibetan currency. It was also called ngüsang [tib. དངུལ་སྲང]. 50 nügsang = 1 dotse; 10 sho = 1 nügsang; 20 5-karma coins = 1 ngüsang. There were also paper currency notes of 7-sang, 25-sang, and 10-sang denominations.">sang</span> or two sang in the chöra. If all the monks don’t come to the chöra, they will get no share of alms.” Since then, they gave the alms in the chöra. Even the <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. བླ་རྒྱུད་པ] A term for the common monks in a monastery (in contrast to the scholar monks who were actively studying the Buddhist doctrine).">lagyüba</span>, the non-<span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. དཔེ་ཆ་བ] A monk studying the monastic philosophical curriculum. A scholar monk.">pechawa</span> monks, also attended the chöra, so the chöra became quite big. However, many monks didn’t go to the chöra when they heard that the alms would be given in the chöra. As a result, gradually, the pechawa and the lagyüba became two groups and a big kind of law case arose.   

**Q:**  Khen Rimpoche said they had to come to the <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. ཆོས་ར] The special grove (&quot;dharma grove&quot;) in monasteries where monks formally met to practice debating.">chöra</span>. Did he mean the monks just had to go to the chöra physically and get the alms but didn’t need to study, or did he mean they had to come to the chöra and study?   

**A:**  He didn’t say that they had to study, but he said that they had to go the <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. ཆོས་ར] The special grove (&quot;dharma grove&quot;) in monasteries where monks formally met to practice debating.">chöra</span> physically. He said, "Please come to the chöra because there are only a very few monks there."   

**Q:**  Then what happened?  

**A:**  Then Jiso Tagkhare [Tib. སྟག་ཁ་རལ], who was standing on the side of the <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. བླ་རྒྱུད་པ] A term for the common monks in a monastery (in contrast to the scholar monks who were actively studying the Buddhist doctrine).">lagyüba</span> [answer not finished]   

**Q:**  Was Jiso Tagkhare involved in this?  

**A:**  I heard that Jiso Tagkhare was kind of the main person and all the <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. བླ་རྒྱུད་པ] A term for the common monks in a monastery (in contrast to the scholar monks who were actively studying the Buddhist doctrine).">lagyüba</span> stood on his side. I heard that many lagyüba monk gathered together. And on the <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. དཔེ་ཆ་བ] A monk studying the monastic philosophical curriculum. A scholar monk.">pechawa</span> side, the main person was Khen Rimpoche and his manager, the <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. ཕྱག་མཛོད] A senior manager/treasurer of an aristocratic or monastic estate, or the senior manager/treasurer of an aristocratic family or a monastic unit. Generally chandzö handled both internal and external issues and were considered higher in power and status than nyerpa (stewards), who typically only handled the storerooms.">chandzö</span>, and probably the <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. ཚོགས་འདུ] 1. The general name for the various types of Tibetan government assemblies. 2. Any assembly, e.g., the assembly (meeting) of monks in a college.">tsondu</span> members of the tratsang. Gradually, there was a dispute between them and they submitted a petition to the government.  

**Q:**  What year was that?   

**A:**  It was probably in 1958.   

**Q:**  It should be earlier than that.   

**A:**  It might have been 1957-58.   

**Q:**  When you people went for the <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. ཆོས་ཐོག] A monastic &quot;academic semester.&quot; A period of studying/debating in the monastic curriculum that is something like a term or semester. A period of time when monks were engaged in formal studying. There were eight chöthog in a year: the autumn chöthog (tönchö [tib. སྟོན་ཆོས]) was for one month, the summer chöthog (yarchö [tib. དབྱར་ཆོས]) was for one month, the winter chöthog (günchö [tib. དགུན་ཆོས]) was for one month, and the spring chöthog (jichö [tib. དཔྱིད་ཆོས]) was for one month. Then there were also two monthly chöra called dachö [tib. ཟླ་ཆོས] and two 15 day chöra called jönga chöra [tib. བཅོ་ལྔ་ཆོས་ར].">chöthog</span>, where you go from place to place to debate and study religion, who was the abbot of <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. སྒོ་མང] One of the large colleges in Drepung Monastery.">Gomang</span>? Was he the Mongolian?   

**A:**  Yes.   

**Q:**  They didn’t change the abbot, right?   

**A:**  Yes, but the karam gyüpa [?] was changed and he was told that he was not allowed to stay in the tratsang. This should have been in 1958.   

**Q:**  Gelek Rimpoche: No. When I took the fourth <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. དགེ་ཤེས] An advanced degree earned by scholar monks.">geshe</span> exam [Tib. སྐབས་བཞི་པའི་དམ་བཅའ], the abbot was Drangchen [Tib. དྲང་ཆེན] Khembo. Did he (the Mongolian) become the abbot after Drangchen Khembo?   

**A:**  Yes.   

**Q:**  It should have been in 1954-55-56-57.   

**A:**  After that, not long ago, the war took place.  

**Q:**  At that time, you were there. What did you think about that? What did you hear about from both sides, the <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. བླ་རྒྱུད་པ] A term for the common monks in a monastery (in contrast to the scholar monks who were actively studying the Buddhist doctrine).">lagyüba</span> and the <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. དཔེ་ཆ་བ] A monk studying the monastic philosophical curriculum. A scholar monk.">pechawa</span> might have had reasons. Otherwise, there would not have been trouble.   

**A:**  [laughing] People like me didn’t hear anything about the reasons. The main thing was that they were saying it was not okay to give a salary [Tib. ཕོགས] in the <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. ཆོས་ར] The special grove (&quot;dharma grove&quot;) in monasteries where monks formally met to practice debating.">chöra</span>, and it should be given in the <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. སྒོ་མཆོར] The area outside of the monastic assembly hall that is supported by tall pillars.">gomchor</span> as they did before.   

**Q:**  Was it the salary [Tib. ཕོགས] or the alms, [Tib. འགྱེད] or both?  

**A:**  It should have been the salary. Otherwise, I didn’t know much about this. When I was in the <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. ཁང་ཚན] A monastic residential unit in which monks from specific geographic areas lived. These were corporate entities with property and internal officials. Some large khamtsen had smaller subordinate units called mi tshan. Khamtsen were part of tratsang (colleges). For example, Hamdong Khamtsen was part of Gomang College in Drepung Monastery.">khamtsen</span>, the monks gathered together and were going up and down to the assembly. And I heard Jiso Tagkhare saying, “You must bring a lawsuit in whatever way you like, and I will stand behind you and take care of the expenses that are necessary.”   

**Q:**  Was it the abbot’s idea that it was better if the monks came to the <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. ཆོས་ར] The special grove (&quot;dharma grove&quot;) in monasteries where monks formally met to practice debating.">chöra</span> and studied?   

**A:**  The abbot might have thought that if the monks didn’t come to the assembly and the <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. ཆོས་ར] The special grove (&quot;dharma grove&quot;) in monasteries where monks formally met to practice debating.">chöra</span> and took their salary, they could not purify their negativity. And if they came to the assembly and the chöra, they could purify their negativity. He was mainly saying that there was a small number of monks coming to the chöra, so they should come to the chöra.   

**Q:**  The abbot might have thought that they should come to the <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. ཆོས་ར] The special grove (&quot;dharma grove&quot;) in monasteries where monks formally met to practice debating.">chöra</span> regularly, not only when there was a salary, right?   

**A:**  Yes, probably. I didn’t hear much, but I heard the main speaker was the abbot’s chandzö.   

**Q:**  How was it decided later on?   

**A:**  One night, when we were in Lumbum [Tib. ཀླུ་འབུམ] Khamtsen, Jiso Tagkhare and those people were coming carrying 5-6-7-8 kerosene oil lamps, and the monks also had short sticks and false keys (used for hitting) hanging on their [monks’] skirts. They were very aggressive. Lumbum Khamtsen and the <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. གྲྭ་ཚང] A &quot;college&quot; within a monastery, for example, in Drepung Monastery there were four main tratsang: Gomang, Loseling, Deyang and Ngagpa. These tratsang were property owning corporate entities and included monks who were organized into residential dormitories called Khamtsen.">tratsang</span> were side by side and we saw that they were going to the roof of the tratsang. There were more than 400-500 monks gathered there.   

**Q:**  They were going to fight with the abbot, right?   

**A:**  Yes. When I watched from the <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. ཁང་ཚན] A monastic residential unit in which monks from specific geographic areas lived. These were corporate entities with property and internal officials. Some large khamtsen had smaller subordinate units called mi tshan. Khamtsen were part of tratsang (colleges). For example, Hamdong Khamtsen was part of Gomang College in Drepung Monastery.">khamtsen</span>, I swear by the Lama and Three Jewels [Tib. བླ་མ་དཀོན་ཅོག], the small alley was filled with about 500-600 monks. Then when they went up, the <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. གྲྭ་ཚང] A &quot;college&quot; within a monastery, for example, in Drepung Monastery there were four main tratsang: Gomang, Loseling, Deyang and Ngagpa. These tratsang were property owning corporate entities and included monks who were organized into residential dormitories called Khamtsen.">tratsang</span> might have been holding a meeting with several seniors (Tib. དྲེཔ [Tib. བགྲེས་པ]), like Hamdong Drepa [Tib. ཧར་གདོང་བགྲེས་པ], Gungru Drepa, Lumbum Drepa, Badi Drepa [Tib. སྦྲ་སྡི་བགྲེས་པ], Samlo [Tib. བསམ་ལྷོ] Drepa, etc., and the tratsang prayer leader [Tib. ཏྲཙང་ཆེམམོ], <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. དགེ་སྐོས] The main disciplinary official in a monastic college (tratsang).">gegö</span> and the chandzö. All of them were attending the meeting. I heard that when the large meeting was assembled, all the khamtsen gegen also attended. I heard that all of them had assembled. At this time, all the monks rushed in, and Khen Rimpoche was just staying there and he didn’t have anything to do.   

**Q:**  He didn’t even know they were coming, right?   

**A:** Yes. I heard that some of the <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. ལྡབ་ལྡོབ] A mildly deviant type of fighting or &quot;punk&quot; monk who engaged in fighting and other unusual behaviors for monks in traditional Tibet&#x27;s large monasteries.">dobdo</span> went in and slapped Khen Rimpoche once, and they came down and tied the hands of the chandzö. The prayer leader was also there.  

**Q:** Was he the one with the small head who later became the <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. ཚོགས་ཆེན] The main assembly hall of a monastery. The assembly hall for the monastery as a whole.">tsogchen</span> chemmo?  

**A:** Not that one. They tied the chandzö’s hands and tied him to a pillar by lifting up his skirt and putting his bare bottom on the cold floor for the whole night, and they beat him severely. Many others were also beaten.  

**Q:** Was it winter?  

**A:** Yes.  

**Q:** How many <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. ཕྱག་མཛོད] A senior manager/treasurer of an aristocratic or monastic estate, or the senior manager/treasurer of an aristocratic family or a monastic unit. Generally chandzö handled both internal and external issues and were considered higher in power and status than nyerpa (stewards), who typically only handled the storerooms.">chandzö</span> were there?  

**A:** There was the <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. བླ་བྲང] 1. The property/wealth owning corporate entity of an incarnate lama. 2. The property/wealth owning corporate entity of the Panchen Lama.">labrang</span> <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. ཕྱག་མཛོད] A senior manager/treasurer of an aristocratic or monastic estate, or the senior manager/treasurer of an aristocratic family or a monastic unit. Generally chandzö handled both internal and external issues and were considered higher in power and status than nyerpa (stewards), who typically only handled the storerooms.">chandzö</span>. I don’t know how many chandzö were there.  

**Q:** There were also the <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. ཕྱག་སྦུག] A manager (of estates and endowments) of a monastic college or monastic khamtsen.">chabu</span>, right?  

**A:** Yes.  

**Q:** How many <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. ཕྱག་སྦུག] A manager (of estates and endowments) of a monastic college or monastic khamtsen.">chabu</span> were usually there?  

**A:** There were about 4 of them. I have never been to the tsondu.  

**Q:** The <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. ཁང་ཚན་དགེ་རྒན] The head official of a khamtsen.">khamtsen gegen</span> were also there, right?  

**A:** When they held elaborate (larger) meetings, they would be there.  

**Q:** At this meeting, they were talking about that issue, right?  

**A:** Could be.  

**Q:** The monks fled, right?  

**A:** Yes.  

**Q:** They left the <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. ཆེན་མོ] 1. Abbr. of the name of the Dalai Lama&#x27;s Lord Chamberlain (Drönyerchemmo). 2. Title for the highest status craftsmen in traditional Tibet.">chemmo</span> there, right?  

**A:** Yes. They also left the <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. ཕྱག་མཛོད] A senior manager/treasurer of an aristocratic or monastic estate, or the senior manager/treasurer of an aristocratic family or a monastic unit. Generally chandzö handled both internal and external issues and were considered higher in power and status than nyerpa (stewards), who typically only handled the storerooms.">chandzö</span> there tied up. Some others were tied up as well.   

**Q:** Why did they tie them up?  

**A:** Gelek Rimpoche: Maybe because they were the main ones.  

**Q:** The other monks didn’t go there, right?  

**A:** Yes, because the <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. ལྡབ་ལྡོབ] A mildly deviant type of fighting or &quot;punk&quot; monk who engaged in fighting and other unusual behaviors for monks in traditional Tibet&#x27;s large monasteries.">dobdo</span> might have been guarding them. The other people went there only the next morning. Then they reported it to the government.  

**Q:** After that, they reported it to the government, right?  

**A:** Yes. I heard that they told the government, but I don’t think [answer not finished]  

**Q:** The government didn’t do much, right?  

**A:** They reported it to the government and many monks were dismissed.  

**Q:** How many monks were dismissed ?  

**A:** About 17-18 monks from the <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. བླ་རྒྱུད་པ] A term for the common monks in a monastery (in contrast to the scholar monks who were actively studying the Buddhist doctrine).">lagyüba</span> were dismissed, as well as the prayer leader, the <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. གྲྭ་ཚང] A &quot;college&quot; within a monastery, for example, in Drepung Monastery there were four main tratsang: Gomang, Loseling, Deyang and Ngagpa. These tratsang were property owning corporate entities and included monks who were organized into residential dormitories called Khamtsen.">tratsang</span> chemmo, and the karam gyüpa. And from the <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. དཔེ་ཆ་བ] A monk studying the monastic philosophical curriculum. A scholar monk.">pechawa</span>, some of them were also dismissed. And the remaining 100-200 <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. སྒོ་མང] One of the large colleges in Drepung Monastery.">Gomang</span> monks had to go to <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. ནོར་བུ་གླིང་ཁ] The summer palace of the Dalai Lama.">Norbulinga</span> to prostrate for a month. At that time, my teacher was a Mongolian called Jimpa La [Tib. སྦྱིན་པ་ལགས], who said, “We are monks from far away, so we will not know what they are doing. I am sure you are not planning to go. You are not allowed to go and you don’t need to go there because we came to study <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. དཔེ་ཆ] Religious books/texts, scriptures.">pecha</span> and not to bring a lawsuit.” So we didn’t go. From Lumbum Khamtsen, only one monk went and he had to go prostrate. But because he was first on the register of names and he was old, some younger monks were sent as <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. གཞོན་ཁྲལ] The work obligations all young monks have to do for the monastery (it literally means &quot;youth tax&quot;).">shöndre</span> to prostrate on his behalf. So when his name was called, the younger ones went to prostrate.   

**Q:** This old monk was on the side of <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. བླ་རྒྱུད་པ] A term for the common monks in a monastery (in contrast to the scholar monks who were actively studying the Buddhist doctrine).">lagyüba</span> or <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. དཔེ་ཆ་བ] A monk studying the monastic philosophical curriculum. A scholar monk.">pechawa</span>?  

**A:** He was on the side of lagyüba.   

**Q:** What does <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. བླ་རྒྱུད་པ] A term for the common monks in a monastery (in contrast to the scholar monks who were actively studying the Buddhist doctrine).">lagyüba</span> mean?   

**A:** Lagyüba means the monks who study lamrim, and <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. དཔེ་ཆ་བ] A monk studying the monastic philosophical curriculum. A scholar monk.">pechawa</span> means the ones who study the five key set of texts used by the monks in their studies of Buddhist dialectics [that is, the scholar monks].  

**Q:** Did somebody come to call you people to join them?   

**A:** When we finished the <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. ཆོས་ར] The special grove (&quot;dharma grove&quot;) in monasteries where monks formally met to practice debating.">chöra</span>, the <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. ཨ་མདོ] One of the three main Tibetan sub-ethnic areas. It is located in the northeast of the Tibetan Plateau mostly in today&#x27;s Qinghai Province. A person from Amdo is called an Amdowa.">Amdo</span> monk called Tsültrim [answer not finished]  

**Q:** You mean Tsültrim with the beard?  

**A:** Yes.  

**Q:** Was he involved in this?   

**A:** He was on the <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. དཔེ་ཆ་བ] A monk studying the monastic philosophical curriculum. A scholar monk.">pechawa</span> side. There was a servant of a monk called Tsültrim who was a great geshe. I don’t know whether he was the white Tsültrim or the black Tsültrim. He called me many times. Usually, I would go home quickly. Otherwise, if I didn’t come back from the <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. ཆོས་ར] The special grove (&quot;dharma grove&quot;) in monasteries where monks formally met to practice debating.">chöra</span> for some time, our <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. ཁང་ཚན་དགེ་རྒན] The head official of a khamtsen.">khamtsen gegen</span> would ask me, “Where did you go? Did you wander around while the other monks stayed here?”  

**Q:** It sounds like the government punished both sides?  

**A:** Yes. Both sides were punished and monks were dismissed from both sides.  

**Q:** What about the salary payment?  

**A:** It was decided to give it from the <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. སྒོ་མཆོར] The area outside of the monastic assembly hall that is supported by tall pillars.">gomchor</span> as in the old system, not from the chöra.  

**Q:** As an American, it seems like the monks who were studying Buddhist dialectics should get better salary than the monks who were not. So making more monks go to the <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. ཆོས་ར] The special grove (&quot;dharma grove&quot;) in monasteries where monks formally met to practice debating.">chöra</span> was a good idea. I don’t know why there was so much opposition.  

**A:** There were monks who were not that intelligent, and just started to study and didn’t know much <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. དཔེ་ཆ] Religious books/texts, scriptures.">pecha</span>. And some didn’t have time to study pecha, and some would wander around and enjoy their lives. Since people have different levels of faith, there were not many who studied pecha. That’s why those things happened. This might also have been a karmic sign that the Chinese Communists were coming and they were going to attack.  

**Q:** What was your feeling when you came to Lhasa, and what are your impressions of the differences of when you first came from Tashikhyil Monastery many years ago? Did you feel comfortable and did the monks interact the same? Or was there a little bit that was not right?  

**A:** When we came from Tashikhyil to Lhasa, Lhasa was a sacred place, which was called the pure realm [Tib. དག་པའི་ཞིང] and the realm of the dharma [Tib. ཆོས་ཀྱི་ཞིང]. When I saw Lhasa and saw the Buddha’s statue [Tib. ཇོ་བོ་རིན་པོ་ཆེ], and I used the butter I brought from [my] homeland and offered the butter lamp in the golden lamp container, and when I could also see the great monastic seats, I felt very happy. When I got to the <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. ཆོས་ར] The special grove (&quot;dharma grove&quot;) in monasteries where monks formally met to practice debating.">chöra</span>, I found that there were only 200-300 monks. Whereas in Tashikhyil, we had a very big chöra. I was wondering what was going on and why there was only such a small amount of monks in the chöra. When they served the tea in the <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. གྲྭ་ཚང] A &quot;college&quot; within a monastery, for example, in Drepung Monastery there were four main tratsang: Gomang, Loseling, Deyang and Ngagpa. These tratsang were property owning corporate entities and included monks who were organized into residential dormitories called Khamtsen.">tratsang</span>, there were so many lamas and monks, but not in the chöra. So I thought this was strange. In general, I saw everything was good and I had deep faith towards the religion. So even if I didn’t have <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. རྩམ་པ] The traditional Tibetan staple food that consists of grain that is roasted (popped), usually in sand, and then ground into a flour.">tsampa</span> to eat, mentally, I was very happy.   

**Q:** In Tashikhyil, were most of the monks <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. དཔེ་ཆ་བ] A monk studying the monastic philosophical curriculum. A scholar monk.">pechawa</span>?   

**A:** In Tashikhyil, there were many <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. དཔེ་ཆ་བ] A monk studying the monastic philosophical curriculum. A scholar monk.">pechawa</span>, but there were also non-pechawa. Among them, there were 80 monks said to be the servants of the Jamyang Shepa [Tib. འཇམ་དབྱངས་བཞད་པ]. And there were many non-pechawa who would work on printing scriptures. There were probably 200-300 people carving wood printing blocks, and some non-pechawa would have to dance the religious dance, like Milarepa [Tib. མི་ལ་རས་པ] and Gombo Dorje [Tib. མགོན་པོ་རྡོར་རྗེ].  

**Q:** Was the level of studying <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. དཔེ་ཆ] Religious books/texts, scriptures.">pecha</span> the same as in Drepung?  

**A:** I think <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. སྒོ་མང] One of the large colleges in Drepung Monastery.">Gomang</span> Tratsang was more deep [Tib. གཏིང་ཟབ་པོ] regarding studies. In Tashikhyil, there was not much study on Namdrel [Tib. རྣམ་འགྲེལ], the study of logic. In Drepung, we had the full range of study.  

**Q:** Did the monks in Tashikhyil have better conditions, like with respect to salary and alms and that stuff?  

**A:** In Tashikhyil, the conditions were very good. The salary and alms we got from the <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. ཚོགས་ཆེན] The main assembly hall of a monastery. The assembly hall for the monastery as a whole.">tsogchen</span> and <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. གྲྭ་ཚང] A &quot;college&quot; within a monastery, for example, in Drepung Monastery there were four main tratsang: Gomang, Loseling, Deyang and Ngagpa. These tratsang were property owning corporate entities and included monks who were organized into residential dormitories called Khamtsen.">tratsang</span> would be almost enough for us [to subsist] for each semester.  

**Q:** You said it was almost enough. In case it was not enough, what would you do?  

**A:** In case it was not enough, if we took a loan and bought the things needed, when we got some big alms, we would repay the loan.  

**Q:** You said that there were just a few hundred monks attending the <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. ཆོས་ར] The special grove (&quot;dharma grove&quot;) in monasteries where monks formally met to practice debating.">chöra</span>. Did the other monks who did not attend the chöra but came to collect their alms live in the monastery, or did they stay in the town and villages?  

**A:** Most would probably stay in the monastery. Some of them had work in the villages, so they would probably go back and forth.  

**Q:** They knew when there were alms and salary, right?  

**A:** Yes. They would send messages to each other. (Gelek Rimpoche: We would receive a message from Radö [Tib. ར་སྟོད] Monastery when there were alms and salary in Loseling. As soon as Nyare [Tib. ཉག་དབྲེ] Khamtsen knew, they would send a monk to Radö.  

**Q:** Radö is located not near, right?  

**A:** Yes, it is a long distance.   

**A:** Gelek Rimpoche: They would come even at night. Drepung Nyare and Radö Nyare were regarded as one, and they got salary from Drepung. When there was a big alms and grain salary in Radö, they would call Drepung. But Radö probably didn’t have much.  

**A:**  When the Dalai Lama took the <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. དགེ་ཤེས] An advanced degree earned by scholar monks.">geshe</span> exam, there were so many monks that the assembly hall was full and the outside was also full.   

**Q:** Did all the monks of Radö go?  

**A:** Gelek Rimpoche: No. Only the Nyare ones.  

**Q:** In Mönlam, would the Radö monks come?  

**A:** Gelek Rimpoche: They came, but they would assemble separately.   

**Q:** How did you come to Tibet?  

**A:** I was born in Kokonor, which the Chinese call Qinghai. It was the place called Gome [Tib. མགུ་སྨད྄] located near the birth place of Tsongkapa. I was born in 1925. In that place, there was a small branch monastery with about 300 monks and I became a monk there. When I was small, I was sick for a long time. Our lama was called Gönkyab [Tib. མགོན་སྐྱབས] Rimpoche and he was one of the better <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. དཔེ་ཆ་བ] A monk studying the monastic philosophical curriculum. A scholar monk.">pechawa</span> under Jamyang Shepa [Tib. འཇམ་དབྱངས་བཞད་པ]. The lama was told that this child was seriously sick, and his eyes had gotten stuck and his bottom had sores. The lama told my mother that your child will die soon. Then she asked what shall we do? And the Lama said, “If you don’t want your son to be dead, then you have to make him a monk. Otherwise, he will die tomorrow or the day after tomorrow.” So I became a monk and in that monastery, they taught me starting from the alphabet and all the prayers to be recited in the monastery. Then some of our monks came back from Lhasa and they said it would be good to go to Tashikhyil because there were many monks there. So two or three of us ran away to Tashikhyil and stayed there.  

**Q:** What year was that? How old are you now?  

**A:** I am 66. Tashikhyil was a very big monastery founded by Jamyang Shepa, where there were about 3,000-4,000 monks and I had no choice but to study dialects. The teachers were harsh and there was one called shengo and one called teacher, gegen. The discipline was very strict and we could not move freely, and it was hard for me to stay there. Then I went through the motions of studying <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. མཚན་ཉིད] Buddhist dialectics. This is taught after the six-year curriculum called düdra.">tsenyi</span> dialectics. We had to take many memory exams, like yearly exams. In each month, we had to take memory exams of 30-40 pages. If you couldn’t pass the exam, they would punish us. I stayed in Tashikhyil for 17 years. When I reached the higher grades, I got a higher seat in the <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. ཚོགས་ཆེན] The main assembly hall of a monastery. The assembly hall for the monastery as a whole.">tsogchen</span> and it was very nice. When I reached the grade of dzö wogma [Tib. མཛོད་འོག་མ], the monastery would teach us Tibetan astrology. I came to Tashikhyil when I was 13 and stayed there for 17 years. At that time, the Communists came and they did not treat us well. Many people were fleeing and just before I fled, I sold my house and the miscellaneous things, and I thought it would be good to flee to Lhasa. So when I was 31, I fled to Lhasa. At that time, Lhasa was very happy because the Communists had not come. We belonged to Drepung <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. སྒོ་མང] One of the large colleges in Drepung Monastery.">Gomang</span> Tratsang, and if I had gone to Ganden, I would have belonged to Ganden Lumbum. I joined Drepung Lumbum, which is known to be the Tsongkapa’s <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. ཁང་ཚན] A monastic residential unit in which monks from specific geographic areas lived. These were corporate entities with property and internal officials. Some large khamtsen had smaller subordinate units called mi tshan. Khamtsen were part of tratsang (colleges). For example, Hamdong Khamtsen was part of Gomang College in Drepung Monastery.">khamtsen</span>, and there was Tsongkapa’s throne, which is said he used when he took his exams. I stayed in Gomang for 4-5 years. And I also continued my studies, but I didn’t need to take any exams, so it was relaxing and happy.   

**Q:** In the beginning, how did you join the <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. ཁང་ཚན] A monastic residential unit in which monks from specific geographic areas lived. These were corporate entities with property and internal officials. Some large khamtsen had smaller subordinate units called mi tshan. Khamtsen were part of tratsang (colleges). For example, Hamdong Khamtsen was part of Gomang College in Drepung Monastery.">khamtsen</span>?  

**A:** When I came to Lhasa, I heard that I belonged to Lumbum Khamtsen because I was born in Kokonor, and that I was not allowed to go to any other <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. ཁང་ཚན] A monastic residential unit in which monks from specific geographic areas lived. These were corporate entities with property and internal officials. Some large khamtsen had smaller subordinate units called mi tshan. Khamtsen were part of tratsang (colleges). For example, Hamdong Khamtsen was part of Gomang College in Drepung Monastery.">khamtsen</span>. They told me that I had to come to Lumbum Khamtsen and the monks of the khamtsen took me to Drepung, and they had a kind of reception for me.  

**Q:** How did you go to Lumbum Khamtsen the first time? Did you just decide to go to Drepung, or did somebody tell you that it would be good to go to Drepung? Or did you have a relative in Drepung?  

**A:** When I reached Lhasa, there was a house of Lumbum Khamtsen. When I asked people where Lumbum Khamtsen was, I would reach the house where there were Lumbum Drepa and some monks. On the next day, they took me to Drepung.  

**Q:** When you reached <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. སྒོ་མང] One of the large colleges in Drepung Monastery.">Gomang</span>, where did you go? You had to go to the <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. ཁང་ཚན་དགེ་རྒན] The head official of a khamtsen.">khamtsen gegen</span> or who?  

**A:** When I reached Lumbum Khamtsen, which had a very strict discipline, first I had to go to the <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. ཁང་ཚན་དགེ་རྒན] The head official of a khamtsen.">khamtsen gegen</span> and he would arrange the new monks to the senior monks to keep as their pupil, gidru. When the khamtsen gegen told me, you belong to this <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. དགེ་རྒན] 1. Teacher in a school. 2. In monastic settings it also refers to an adult monk who acted as a guardian to a younger monk. In such cases, the younger monk typically lived in the gegen&#x27;s apartment (shag). In monasteries, however, it could also mean a real teacher, or the monk who served as the guarantor for a new monk.">gegen</span>, then the Khangnyer took me to the senior monk and told him that he was my gidru. Then this gegen gave me <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. རྩམ་པ] The traditional Tibetan staple food that consists of grain that is roasted (popped), usually in sand, and then ground into a flour.">tsampa</span> and tea for three days and taught me all the discipline in the khamtsen.  

**Q:** At that time, did you have to stay with the <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. དགེ་རྒན] 1. Teacher in a school. 2. In monastic settings it also refers to an adult monk who acted as a guardian to a younger monk. In such cases, the younger monk typically lived in the gegen&#x27;s apartment (shag). In monasteries, however, it could also mean a real teacher, or the monk who served as the guarantor for a new monk.">gegen</span>?  

**A:** Yes. We came wearing <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. ཕྱུ་པ] The traditional Tibetan men and women&#x27;s dress. It is like a robe that is tied at the waist. Both men and women wear such dresses, although they differ slightly in color and in style.">chupa</span> made from felt, so the <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. དགེ་རྒན] 1.

In such cases, the younger monk typically lived in the gegen&#x27;s apartment (shag).

So he taught us the discipline. This gegen was called the <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. སྤྱི་རྒན] A senior khamtsen official who ranks above the khamtsen gegen.">jigen</span> gegen, or the worldly teacher. After three days, we had to bow down in front of the <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. ཁང་ཚན་དགེ་རྒན] The head official of a khamtsen.">khamtsen gegen</span> and [I had to] pull my shawl down from my shoulders. He asked, "Did the jigen gegen give you enough food to be full for three days?" And I say yes.  

**Q:** Even [though] you were not full, you had to say yes, right?  

**A:** Yes. The monks were poor and they only had <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. རྩམ་པ] The traditional Tibetan staple food that consists of grain that is roasted (popped), usually in sand, and then ground into a flour.">tsampa</span> and black tea, and didn’t have other foods.  

**Q:** There was no butter and milk and those things, right?  

**A:** Yes. Because we were newcomers. The <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. ཁང་ཚན་དགེ་རྒན] The head official of a khamtsen.">khamtsen gegen</span> told us how to attend the <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. ཚོག] 1. An offering made of tsamba, butter and dry cheese in the shape of a cone. 2. A prayer assembly meeting in monasteries when all the monks come to an assembly hall and chant prayers together.">tshog</span> and <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. ཆོས་ར] The special grove (&quot;dharma grove&quot;) in monasteries where monks formally met to practice debating.">chöra</span>, and how we were not allowed to make fire and fetch water during the prayer sessions. And how we were not allowed to buy bread and cooked animals heads and hooves from the market on the stairs [where merchants came]. And we had to repeat what the Khamtsen <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. དགེ་རྒན] 1. Teacher in a school. 2. In monastic settings it also refers to an adult monk who acted as a guardian to a younger monk. In such cases, the younger monk typically lived in the gegen&#x27;s apartment (shag). In monasteries, however, it could also mean a real teacher, or the monk who served as the guarantor for a new monk.">gegen</span> said. There were about 12-13 prohibitions. He also said that we had to call the seniors gegen and call the juniors by their dharma names [Tib. ཆོས་མིང], and it was not allowed to call them different names. After this, the khamtsen gegen gave me a room with an inferior cushion. We had to clean the room. After that, we had to buy everything and eat by ourselves.  

**Q:** Was the room for one person?  

**A:** Yes. But when there were many monks, two or three people had to stay together. In the beginning, I got a <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. 1. ཤག, 2. ཞག] 1. The apartment/room of a monk. 2. The butter fat that coagulates on the top of butter-tea when the tea is left to sit for some time. If the tea had been made with a lot of butter, this layer could be thick enough to scoop off and save to later sell or eat separately. The senior monks are usually served tea with a lot of shag.">shag</span> for myself. When I was staying there, I didn’t have much <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. རྩམ་པ] The traditional Tibetan staple food that consists of grain that is roasted (popped), usually in sand, and then ground into a flour.">tsampa</span> to eat and I couldn’t buy much tsampa because I didn’t have much money. So I had a very hard time. At that time, a small (young) lama came from the same branch monastery in our homeland and I received a letter saying that I had to take care of him and be his teacher, and that he was coming to me. Later, the lama came and he had a chandzö. The lama might have been very wealthy and they brought a lot of butter.

**Q:** When you first joined Lumbum Khamtsen, did you have to work for <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. གཞོན་ཁྲལ] The work obligations all young monks have to do for the monastery (it literally means &quot;youth tax&quot;).">shöndre</span>?  

**A:** Yes, I had to.   

**Q:** Even though you were a senior monk in Tashikhyil?  

**A:** No matter whether I was a senior or not, I had to do the shöndre. Lumbum and Trehor [Tib. ཏྲེ་ཧོར] had the most strict discipline that was like the <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. བླ་མ་རྒྱུད་པ] The name for the monks enrolled in the Upper and Lower Tantric Monastic Colleges in Lhasa (gyüme and gyütö).">lama gyüpa</span> discipline. We had to bow down by pulling our shawls from our shoulders [Tib. གཟན་སྐྱུར་ཕབ] when we went to the main khamtsen. However, when we reached the pharchin [Tib. ཕར་ཕྱིན] grade, then we didn’t need to pull down our shawls from our shoulders.  

**Q:** Even if you were a senior monk in Tashikhyil, you had to do the same, right?  

**A:** Yes.  

**Q:** Can you explain about what you had to do for <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. གཞོན་ཁྲལ] The work obligations all young monks have to do for the monastery (it literally means &quot;youth tax&quot;).">shöndre</span>?  

**A:** Sometimes, the <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. གྲྭ་ཚང] A &quot;college&quot; within a monastery, for example, in Drepung Monastery there were four main tratsang: Gomang, Loseling, Deyang and Ngagpa.

Sometimes, we had to carry many loads of butter and rice from Lhasa for the khamtsen. When many guests came from <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. ཨ་མདོ] One of the three main Tibetan sub-ethnic areas. It is located in the northeast of the Tibetan Plateau mostly in today&#x27;s Qinghai Province. A person from Amdo is called an Amdowa.">Amdo</span>, we had to go to Lhasa and carry their loads. From Lhasa, they would hand over a list of contents of the loads one by one and we had to deliver it to Drepung one by one. Sometimes, the Khamtsen Gegen would come to Lhasa and provide <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. རྩམ་པ] The traditional Tibetan staple food that consists of grain that is roasted (popped), usually in sand, and then ground into a flour.">tsampa</span> and tea. And sometimes there was no tsampa and tea, but we had to carry the loads right away. Sometimes we had to do white washing and black polishing in the khamtsen. At that time, there were many jobs to do, like sweeping the courtyard.   

**Q:** When there was <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. ཚོམ་ཇ] The name of the khamtsen&#x27;s prayer assembly meetings at which tea was served.">tsomja</span> in the <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. ཁང་ཚན] A monastic residential unit in which monks from specific geographic areas lived.

**A:** We had to go and serve tea.  

**Q:** Did you have to go to the <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. གྲྭ་ཚང] A &quot;college&quot; within a monastery, for example, in Drepung Monastery there were four main tratsang: Gomang, Loseling, Deyang and Ngagpa. These tratsang were property owning corporate entities and included monks who were organized into residential dormitories called Khamtsen.">tratsang</span> and do the same?  

**A:** Yes. But we felt it was not right to go [Tib. འགྲོ་ཤེས་ཀྱི་མི་འདུག] [laughing] to serve tea. Only the younger ones could go. When there was <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. གྲྭ་ཇ] The prayer session sponsored by the tratsang (college) at which tea was served to its monks who attended.">traja</span> tea, it was mostly when there was a <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. གཏོང་སྒོ] A monastic obligation to provide the food and other necessary items served at a monastic prayer assembly meeting or some other rite; this was often a required obligation for monastic officials at the end of their term of office.">tonggo</span>, like the <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. དགེ་ཤེས] An advanced degree earned by scholar monks.">geshe</span> tonggo. Normally, there weren’t many small traja.

**A:** There were probably not many <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. གྲྭ་ཇ] The prayer session sponsored by the tratsang (college) at which tea was served to its monks who attended.">traja</span> unless there was a <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. གཏོང་སྒོ] A monastic obligation to provide the food and other necessary items served at a monastic prayer assembly meeting or some other rite; this was often a required obligation for monastic officials at the end of their term of office.">tonggo</span>. (Gelek Rimpoche: In <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. བློ་གསལ་གླིང] One of the main colleges in Drepung Monastery.">Loseling</span> we had traja all the time.) Maybe those were small traja and all the monks didn’t need to go. [laughing] Unless there was a big tonggo and you were strong enough, people like us could not go because if we went, we might have gotten killed because of too much pushing.  

**Q:** Did you have to do the <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. གཞོན་ཁྲལ] The work obligations all young monks have to do for the monastery (it literally means &quot;youth tax&quot;).">shöndre</span> in the <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. ཚོགས་ཆེན] The main assembly hall of a monastery. The assembly hall for the monastery as a whole.">tsogchen</span> (the monastery as a whole)?  

**A:** Yes, we had to. But I didn’t go much because it was very hard since the road was not even and people said that their legs would get broken.  

**Q:** Did you have to do the <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. གཞོན་ཁྲལ] The work obligations all young monks have to do for the monastery (it literally means &quot;youth tax&quot;).">shöndre</span> every day?  

**A:** No, only sometimes.

Would the <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. ཁང་ཚན་དགེ་རྒན] The head official of a khamtsen.">khamtsen gegen</span> or the <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. གཉེར་པ] A steward or manager.

They had a name list of monks who did the <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. གཞོན་ཁྲལ] The work obligations all young monks have to do for the monastery (it literally means &quot;youth tax&quot;).">shöndre</span> and the names of the ones who were yet to be done.

**Q:** What was the structure of the <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. ཁང་ཚན] A monastic residential unit in which monks from specific geographic areas lived. These were corporate entities with property and internal officials. Some large khamtsen had smaller subordinate units called mi tshan. Khamtsen were part of tratsang (colleges).

**A:** In Lumbum Khamtsen, the main one was the senior, Lumbum drepa [Tib. བགྲེས་པ]. Whatever orders he gave had to be obeyed.   

**Q:** There was one Lumbum drepa, right?  

**A:** Yes.  

**Q:** How did the Lumbum drepa come about?  

**A:** The first one on the name list of monks became the drepa (“elder”). If the drepa was too old or incapable, they would make the next one on the list as the new drepa.  

**Q:** Supposing the first one was incapable and the second and the third were also incapable, and the fourth one was sick or something like that, how long would you go down the list like this?  

**A:** There was no limit.  

**Q:** When the drepa stepped down, would you called him ex-drepa (Tib. དྲེཔ་སུརཔ [བགྲེས་པ་ཟུར་པ])?  

**A:** They didn’t call him <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. ཟུར་པ] 1. For positions, &quot;ex-.&quot; 2. For families, a branch of a larger family that had split off at one time in history.">surpa</span>, but he became a drepa surpa when they were told to. When I was there, there were some who were the very first on the name list, but they were not told to be the drepa because they were incapable. The Lumbum drepa named Palden Lhundrup [Tib. དཔལ་ལྡན་ལྷུན་གྲུབ] was very clever and smart, and he was always staying in Lhasa. If you were not smart and couldn’t take care of the visitors coming from <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. ཨ་མདོ] One of the three main Tibetan sub-ethnic areas. It is located in the northeast of the Tibetan Plateau mostly in today&#x27;s Qinghai Province. A person from Amdo is called an Amdowa.">Amdo</span>, you would lose a lot of territory in the homeland. So the Lumbum drepa should be a very capable one.  

**Q:** What do you mean territories?  

**A:** Gelek Rimpoche: The areas where there were people who had relations with the <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. ཁང་ཚན] A monastic residential unit in which monks from specific geographic areas lived.

**Q:** Palden Lhundrup was the drepa, right?  

**A:** Yes. There were also two <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. གཉེར་པ] A steward or manager.

**Q:** Was there a kind of <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. ཚོགས་འདུ] 1. The general name for the various types of Tibetan government assemblies. 2. Any assembly, e.g., the assembly (meeting) of monks in a college.">tsondu</span>?

**A:** They came according the name list of monks. The first name became the <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. ཁང་ཚན་དགེ་རྒན] The head official of a khamtsen.">khamtsen gegen</span> and the next became the <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. གཉེར་པ] A steward or manager.

**Q:** Would all the monks have to become the <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. ཁང་ཚན་དགེ་རྒན] The head official of a khamtsen.">khamtsen gegen</span> and <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. གཉེར་པ] A steward or manager.

**A:** Yes.  

**Q:** They did it for one year, right?  

**A:** Yes.  

**Q:** So if one became doma this year, he would become the <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. གཉེར་པ] A steward or manager. In some monasteries, the nyerpa was in charge of storerooms under the authority of a higher manager called a chandzö.">nyerpa</span> next year, right?

**Q:** How about doma?

**Q:** Were there monks going to pursue grain loans and be cashiers?  

**A:** When I was there, there was no cashier in the <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. ཁང་ཚན] A monastic residential unit in which monks from specific geographic areas lived.

**Q:** Did the Lumbum Drepa keep (physically) the money?  

**A:** He didn’t. All the money was kept in the <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. ཁང་ཚན] A monastic residential unit in which monks from specific geographic areas lived.

**Q:** I heard that in some <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. ཁང་ཚན] A monastic residential unit in which monks from specific geographic areas lived. These were corporate entities with property and internal officials. Some large khamtsen had smaller subordinate units called mi tshan. Khamtsen were part of tratsang (colleges).

**A:** No. [laughing]   

**A:**  Gelek Rimpoche: I have never heard about this. Only when we took a novice vow [Tib. getsül] would they measure whether you were tall enough.  

**Q:** A monk from <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. གཙང་པ] 1. A person from Tsang. 2. A khamtsen in Loseling College.">Tsangpa</span> Khamtsen said that.  

**A:** Maybe he said that as a joke. As for the <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. གཞོན་ཁྲལ] The work obligations all young monks have to do for the monastery (it literally means &quot;youth tax&quot;).">shöndre</span>, when they wanted 10 people, they would send them according to the name list.

**Q:** Did the doma carry wooden water containers when they fetched water?  

**A:** They carried the clay water containers.  

**Q:** How many monks were there in the <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. ཁང་ཚན] A monastic residential unit in which monks from specific geographic areas lived.

For example, Hamdong Khamtsen was part of Gomang College in Drepung Monastery.">khamtsen</span>?  

**A:** When I was there, there were about 120-130 monks. I heard that they said that this was a small number of monks.  

**Q:** The doma would hire people, right?   

**Q:** Gelek Rimpoche: In the monastery, they didn’t have a system of paying money, right?   

**A:** Yes. They just said, “Please.”  

**Q:** In the monastery, when you made your shawls and the skirt, did you hire tailors?  

**A:** When the <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. ཁང་ཚན] A monastic residential unit in which monks from specific geographic areas lived. These were corporate entities with property and internal officials. Some large khamtsen had smaller subordinate units called mi tshan. Khamtsen were part of tratsang (colleges).

Otherwise, the ordinary monks would sew their own things, which were inferior ones. If someone didn’t know sewing, they would ask somebody saying, “Please sew this for me,” and they didn’t pay for it.  

**Q:** How did you subsist then? Would the salary and alms from the <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. གྲྭ་ཚང] A &quot;college&quot; within a monastery, for example, in Drepung Monastery there were four main tratsang: Gomang, Loseling, Deyang and Ngagpa.

For example, Hamdong Khamtsen was part of Gomang College in Drepung Monastery.">khamtsen</span> be enough?  

**A:** Sometimes, we got alms in the <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. ཚོགས་ཆེན] The main assembly hall of a monastery. The assembly hall for the monastery as a whole.">tsogchen</span> and the <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. གྲྭ་ཚང] A &quot;college&quot; within a monastery, for example, in Drepung Monastery there were four main tratsang: Gomang, Loseling, Deyang and Ngagpa. These tratsang were property owning corporate entities and included monks who were organized into residential dormitories called Khamtsen.">tratsang</span> and <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. ཚོམ་ཇ] The name of the khamtsen&#x27;s prayer assembly meetings at which tea was served.">tsomja</span> in the khamtsen. This was almost enough. And the tratsang would give the grain salary, and also some grain salary was given to us from the tsogchen jiso. So it would be almost enough [Tib. ལྡང་གྲབས་ལྡང་གྲབས་བྱེད་ཀྱི་ཡོད་རེད]. And sometimes when this was not enough, we bought <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. རྩམ་པ] The traditional Tibetan staple food that consists of grain that is roasted (popped), usually in sand, and then ground into a flour.">tsampa</span> with the alms that we had saved. And the non-pechawa would go to villages to exchange tsampa with things like incense, tea and those small things. As for me, I had to go through hardships for about year, but since I had that lama, I didn’t have any problems and I had butter tea to drink. Otherwise, the new monks could not drink butter tea. Sometimes, however, we pooled [together] money when we wanted to drink butter tea. We didn’t have a tea churn so we had to borrow one. And sometimes we didn’t have cow dung to make a fire, so we had to eat tsampa with cold water.   

**Q:** At first, you only had the salary and alms, right?  

**A:** I was different than the others because I had some (money) because I had a house in Tashikhyil.  

**Q:** You brought some money, right?  

**A:** Yes. I sold my house in my homeland for 800 silver <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. ད་ཡང; ch. 大洋] A Chinese silver dollar that had the image of Yuan Shikai on its face. It was used by the Chinese government in Tibet in the 1950s because Tibetans did not accept Chinese paper currency.">dayan</span> and I had many other things. So when I displayed them in the market, people bought them right away and I had about 700-800 dayan, so I didn’t have many problems. As for the other monks, if they stayed in the monastery all the time and didn’t go out to find <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. རྩམ་པ] The traditional Tibetan staple food that consists of grain that is roasted (popped), usually in sand, and then ground into a flour.">tsampa</span>, it was very difficult for them.  

**Q:** Some monks thought that if they didn’t go to work for other big <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. ཤག་ཚང] 1. The household or family of a monk that consisted of multiple monks. 2. The apartment of a monk household.">shagtsang</span> it would be difficult. Were there such monks?  

**A:** Yes, there were many monks who went to work for the big <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. ཤག་ཚང] 1. The household or family of a monk that consisted of multiple monks. 2. The apartment of a monk household.">shagtsang</span> and made fire, fetched water and did sweeping, etc. [as a servant], where in return, they got shawls and skirts, and <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. རྩམ་པ] The traditional Tibetan staple food that consists of grain that is roasted (popped), usually in sand, and then ground into a flour.">tsampa</span> also.  

**Q:** You mean they didn’t join the <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. ཤག་ཚང] 1. The household or family of a monk that consisted of multiple monks. 2. The apartment of a monk household.">shagtsang</span>, right?  

**A:** Yes, and some would stay there permanently as their servants. Like Jiso Tagkhare, who had such people.  

**Q:** Tagkhare was in Lumbum, right?  

**A:** No, he was in Washü Mitsen.  

**Q:** He was in Hamdong (College), right?  

**A:** Yes. In Washü Mitsen, many new monks came and they went to Tagkhare and served him. They had to do a lot of things like cleaning because he was very wealthy. They worked for him and got tea and <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. རྩམ་པ] The traditional Tibetan staple food that consists of grain that is roasted (popped), usually in sand, and then ground into a flour.">tsampa</span>, and all kinds of other things, like shawls and skirts.
