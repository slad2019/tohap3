In Sera and Ganden, only the incumbent abbots were in the Laji, however in Drepung, the ex-abbots (Tib. ཁེནསུར [མཁན་ཟུར]) were also in the Laji. Under them, there were the two shengo, the <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. ཚོགས་ཆེན] The main assembly hall of a monastery.

This was the big Laji (Tib. ལཇི་ཆེཁ [Tib. བླ་སྤྱི་ཆེ་ཁག]). The middle size Laji (Tib. དྲིང [འབྲིང་ཁག]) in addition also had the following three: the <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. ཁང་ཚན་དགེ་རྒན] The head official of a khamtsen.">khamtsen gegen</span> of Hamdong [Tib. ཧར་གདོང] and Samlo [Tib. བསམ་ལྷོ], the Parkhang Depa, and the chökang depa. The small Laji had the Jama and chabril. Normally, only the Laji chekha would meet regardless of whatever kind of joint meeting (Tib. lhengye [lhan rhyas]) they held. The box holding the seal of the Laji was kept by the Phodrang Depa and he would hand it over to the senior abbot. Under them, there was the official called the Lama Chandzö who was appointed by the <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. མཁན་པོ་ཁྲི་པ] The most senior abbot in a committee of abbots such as the Laji.">khembo tripa</span> and he served them.

It consisted of the Abbots, the Tshogchen Umdze, the Shengo and the Jiso. In Drepung it also included ex-abbots.">Laji</span>. The Laji would accumulate these things and serve food to the monks.   

**Q:**  When would they serve this food?   

**A:**  There was no fixed time for this. They would do it whenever they got a little income. There were also a few <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. མི་སེར] A term that can mean serf/bound subject as well as citizen, depending on context.

It consisted of the Abbots, the Tshogchen Umdze, the Shengo and the Jiso. In Drepung it also included ex-abbots.">Laji</span>?   

**A:**  There wasn't any basis like an estate because they were just payers of mibo. There were lot of people saying that they belonged to the Drepung Laji.   

**Q:**  They didn't have any land basis, right?   

**A:**  Yes. As long as they paid the <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. མི་བོགས] A status wherein a peasant &quot;leased&quot; his/her &quot;freedom&quot; from his/her lord to live and work where he/she wanted.

If not, they would hold the tsondu on the next day and give the answers on the next day or the day after that. They would send the monks to go somewhere if they had to.

The <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. སྒོ་མང] One of the large colleges in Drepung Monastery.">Gomang</span> Khembo would choose the candidates from the Gomang Böbaphung and the Dülwa Khembo would choose the candidates from Gomang's Gadong [Tib. དགའ་གདོང] <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. མི་ཚན] A sub-unit of a khamtsen.">mitsen</span> and <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. སྡེ་ཡངས] One of the colleges in Drepung Monastery.">Deyang</span> and Ngagpa Colleges would choose their own candidates.   

**Q:**  Was there a rotation among the <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. མི་ཚན] A sub-unit of a khamtsen.">mitsen</span> for the shengo candidates?   

**A:**  Yes. Some got the shengo appointed every 3 years and some got it every 4 years. Some got it every 5 years and some 6 years. I am from Böbaphung (Mitsen), so the <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. བློ་གསལ་གླིང] One of the main colleges in Drepung Monastery.">Loseling</span> Khembo would select the candidates from Böbaphung one month before the <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. དྲུག་པ་ཚེས་བཞི] The religious festival on the 4th of the 6th lunar month commemorating the Buddha&#x27;s first teaching of the Four Noble Truths.">Trugpa Tseshi</span> festival. The candidates had to be from a clean birth status [Tib. སྐྱེ་རུས་གཙང་བ], must be eloquent [Tib. སྨྲ་བརྗོད་བདེ་བ] and must have had 19 years pass since they were admitted to the monastery. On the Trugpa Tseshi, the Böbaphung Mitsen would hold a meeting and put forward 5 candidates. If there were ex-Nyertsang and ex-gegö, they would go first (as candidates). If not, they would select from the ordinary monks. They would submit the candidates to the <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. བླ་སྤྱི] The highest administrative council in large monasteries, like Drepung. It consisted of the Abbots, the Tshogchen Umdze, the Shengo and the Jiso. In Drepung it also included ex-abbots.">Laji</span>. The <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. ཁང་ཚན་དགེ་རྒན] The head official of a khamtsen.">khamtsen gegen</span> had to go to the Laji on that day and report that these were the candidates from Böbaphung. The <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. མཁན་པོ] Abbot of a monastery or monastic college.">khembo</span> would ask the names of the candidates one by one, starting from the first candidate. If they were suitable, the khembo would say yes and if not, he would say something like, "Didn't this person have a dispute in the past?" If the khembo said that, they had to send a new candidate. If the khembo said that all 5 candidates were all right, they could go as the candidates. The incumbent shengo would report the candidates to the Chemmo at the <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. འགག] 1. Abbreviation of Tsega, the Secretariat Office of the Dalai Lama.">gaa</span>. The Chemmo would tell the abbots that on such and such a date they must come to the gaa and the abbots would tell Böbaphung. On that day, they would send the 10 shengo candidates including the two incumbent ones who wore the special padded shoulders [Tib. ཨོ་བོག]. After going to the gaa, the candidates had to go to the <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. ཡིག་ཚང] The highest office dealing with monastic and religious affairs in the traditional Tibetan government. It is often called the Ecclesiastic Office. It was headed by 4 fourth rank monk officials called Trunyichemmo. The senior Trunyichemmo was called Ta Lama.">Yigtsang</span> to show how they looked [Tib. མི་བབ་སྤྱན་ཞུ] and to do the reading test. They selected people who were different from the others and who looked alike [Tib. འདྲ་འདྲའི་དཀྱིལ་ནས་མ་འདྲ་བ]. They said, "From among the five of you, one will be approved." Then the <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. དྲུང་ཡིག་ཆེན་མོ] The title of the four heads of the Yigtsang Office (Ecclesiastics Office).">drunyichemmo</span> would accompany us and we had to go to the stage where they performed the opera. Then we entered the small door of the yellow wall and went to the gaa. Then at the gaa, we would be served tea, <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. རྩམ་པ] The traditional Tibetan staple food that consists of grain that is roasted (popped), usually in sand, and then ground into a flour.">tsampa</span> and fried cookies (Tib. ཁབསེ [ཁ་ཟས] from the Dalai Lama's kitchen [Tib. རྩེ་གསོལ་ཐབ] བེཕོ༹རེ་ཐེ་དྲུངཇ་ཝས་ཧེལད་ཝེ་སྟཡེད་ཐེརེ་དུརིང་ཐེ་དྲུངཇ and then the drunyichemmo would call us and then in the yellow wall the drunyichemmo, the Drönyerchemmo, one tsendrön and one <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. གཟིམ་འགག] 1. A bodyguard. 2. The guards of high officials such as the Dalai Lama, the Regent, the Silön and the Kalön. The Dalai Lama&#x27;s Simgag were called Tse Simgag (tib. རྩེ་གཟིམ་འགག) and the Regent&#x27;s Simgag were called Shöl Simgag (tib. ཞོལ་གཟིམ་འགག). They were not real bodyguards, but functioned more as disciplinarians at meetings and ceremonies. They carried only leather whips. The Silön and Kashag&#x27;s Simgag were all lower-level lay officials. They were called either Simgag or Gagpa (tib. འགག་པ).">simgag</span> were there. They closed the door and ཐེ་ཧོཨུསེ་མནགེར [Tib. ཁངཉེར] of <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. ནོར་བུ་གླིང་ཁ] The summer palace of the Dalai Lama.">Norbulinga</span> held incense under the window of the palace and ཐེ་དལཻ་ལམ and the regent would watch from the window through the curtains made from very fine linen [Tib. ཞལ་སང]. We could hear them talking like whispering. In my time, ཐེ་དྲུཉིཆེམམོ་ཝས་བུམཏང and I was the incumbent gegö. He told me, "Send them in a relaxed manner. Don't be afraid." Then we sent the candidates one by one. After the 10 candidates went in, they came to the <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. དྲུང་ཇ] The daily meeting of Tibetan government monk officials (tsedrung) at which tea was provided. However, unlike the collective meetings of monks in monasteries, there was no collective chanting of prayers at the Drungja. The event started at around 9 a.m. and lasted for about an hour. When the Tse ga (the Dalai Lama&#x27;s Secretariat) was in the Potala, it was held there, and when it was in the Norbulinga Summer Palace, it was held there. All monk officials in Lhasa were expected to attend.">drungja</span> in a line and went to have the audience with the Dalai Lama. All the candidates would be seated in line (Tib. ཤུགཏྲེ་ཏང [བཞུགས་གྲལ་བཏང]).   

**Q:**  Where would you be seated?   

**A:**  In the hall where the Dalai Lama was. I would be seated in front of the Nangma Khende [Tib. ནང་མ་ཁན་སྡེ] [the Khenche and the Khenjung]. I remember clearly that the Ta Lama brought the reading test and he bowed his head towards the Drönyerchemmo. Probably he was seeking permission to read the reading test.   

**Q:**  Was the Dalai Lama still there?   

**A:**  He was on the throne. Then the two <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. དྲུང་ཡིག་ཆེན་མོ] The title of the four heads of the Yigtsang Office (Ecclesiastics Office).">drunyichemmo</span> stood on two sides and the candidate who read the reading test stood in the middle. Then the first candidates went near the door and the Drönyerchemmo faced us and turned his back to the Dalai Lama and the candidates had to read their reading test. In the reading test, one and a half lines of the third smaller letters [Tib. ཚུགས་ཐུང] and one and a half lines of half cursive [Tib. ཚུགས་མ་འཁྱུག] and one and a half lines of the cursive script were written. After all the candidates read the reading test, they would sit and they served tea and <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. གྲོ་མ་འབྲས་སིལ] A special dish consisting of sweetened rice, melted butter and wild sweet potatoes (gro ma).">droma dresi</span>. Then the Simgag would say, "Stand up." and then the ceremony was over and we went back and we didn't know what the outcome was. All the <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. བླ་སྤྱི] The highest administrative council in large monasteries, like Drepung. It consisted of the Abbots, the Tshogchen Umdze, the Shengo and the Jiso. In Drepung it also included ex-abbots.">Laji</span> would also go back after having an audience. We would also eat food and go back. The abbots of <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. བློ་གསལ་གླིང] One of the main colleges in Drepung Monastery.">Loseling</span> and <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. སྒོ་མང] One of the large colleges in Drepung Monastery.">Gomang</span> would stay at the gaa. They had brought a square piece of satin to wrap things [Tib. འབོག]. Each of them also brought a <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. ཁ་བཏགས] A Tibetan ceremonial scarf given to lamas, visitors, etc.">khata</span> nangdzö scarf in the pouch of their robes. After some time, the approval would be made, and while the Drönyerchemmo stood there, the two abbots would go there and prostrate three times and hold the khata and receive the approval from the Drönyerchemmo. They wrapped the approval in the square satin and covered the wrap with the khata nangdzö and carried it on their backs and rode back to the monastery. On that day, the Laji would meet in the Jiso office. They brought the monastic charter of the 5th Dalai Lama and all the abbots would come down. They would be ready to burn incense on the rooftop of the Jiso. When they saw the abbots coming from the mountain range near <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. གནས་ཆུང] 1. One of the main protector deities of the Tibetan government and the Dalai Lama. 2. The monastery in which the medium of Nechung resides that is located just east of Drepung Monastery.">Nechung</span>, they would burn the incense and then from the <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. ཚོགས་ཆེན] The main assembly hall of a monastery. The assembly hall for the monastery as a whole.">tsogchen</span> (main assembly hall) they would blow the big horns and the <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. རྒྱ་གླིང] A clarinet type of wind instrument played by monks in religious services.">gyaling</span> and several thousand of monks came and were packed in on the stone floor courtyard area. On that day, all the abbots would come down to the stone floor courtyard area and bow down [Ch. zhan bai]. The two abbots would bring the square satin and would put it in a bo container that was full of wheat. Right after that, they served tea and the <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. ཚོགས་ཆེན་ཆེན་མོ] The prayer leader (Umdze) of the whole monastery.">Tsogchen chemmo</span> would start the prayers for the tea offering (Tib. chamchö [ཇ་མཆོད]) and all of them would drink a cup of tea. Then they served droma dresi and the Phodrang depa would deliver the approval list to the Khembo Tripa while the abbots were standing. We would show the [undamaged] seal on the satin bog container to the other people. And then they gave the approval to the Khembo Tripa and he would say, "Is it okay to open it?" and then he opened it and then they sent the <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. ཐབ་གཡོག] Monks or laymen who work as servants/manual laborers in kitchens (normally monastic kitchens).">thabyog</span> to deliver the message to the people who were approved. Then everyone knew who the new shengo were because they could see where the thabyog went to deliver the messages. Then the thabyog would say, "Congratulations! Please receive the approval." [Tib. བཀྲ་ཤིས་བདེ་ལེགས་ཕྱག་རྟགས་བཞེས་རོགས་གནང]. Some even would say, "Probably, I am not the one who was approved. Didn't you make a mistake?" [Tib. ང་ཨ་ཡིན། ནོར་བ་མ་རེད་དམ]. If the shengo from Gomang was a <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. དགེ་སྐོས] The main disciplinary official in a monastic college (tratsang).">gegö</span> and the one from Loseling was a Nyertsang, the Gomang one would become the senior shengo. However, if the Gomang was a Nyertsang and the Loseling was a gegö, the Loseling would become the senior. If both of them were ordinary monks, it went according to their seniority. If both were <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. དགེ་སློང] A monk who has taken the full set of vows.">gelong</span>, it went according the gelong's seniority. If one was a gelong and the other was not, the gelong would become the senior. At that time, the 2 old shengo were there, so they would go to the Laji.   

**Q:**  Were the new shengo there?   

**A:**  No. They were in their <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. 1. ཤག, 2. ཞག] 1. The apartment/room of a monk. 2. The butter fat that coagulates on the top of butter-tea when the tea is left to sit for some time.

The senior monks are usually served tea with a lot of shag.">shag</span> (apartments). If the <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. བློ་གསལ་གླིང] One of the main colleges in Drepung Monastery.">Loseling</span> one was the senior shengo, the <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. བླ་སྤྱི] The highest administrative council in large monasteries, like Drepung.

Then the Laji would adjourn. After that, the old senior shengo would go to the new senior shengo who then knew that he was the senior and the new shengo will be invited. Then the old shengo would sit at the head and they would put a plate full of wheat.   

**Q:**  Who would bring this wheat?   

**A:**  This will be prepared by the new shengo. There will be somebody who will explain how to do that. Then the old shengo would put a <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. ཁ་བཏགས] A Tibetan ceremonial scarf given to lamas, visitors, etc.">khata</span> on the wheat and say this is the khata for receiving the order [Tib. བཀའ་སྒྱུར་མཇལ་དར]. Then both of them would be seated and from the old shengo's side, two ex-monastic officials [Tib. lene thönsin] would come with 1 Khata Ashe and 2 subshi [Tib. ཟུབ་ཕྱི] and say, "Please grant leave to the old shengo [who came] before me from the <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. ཚོགས] 1.

When he said before me, it included all the ex-shengo.   

**Q:**  They would ask for leave before the new one did the inauguration ceremony, right?   

**A:**  Yes. Then one Lene <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. ཐོན་ཟིན] The ex-monastic officials who had the title of &quot;thon&quot; by virtue of having completed their monastic job obligations.">thönsin</span> came from the new shengo's side and gave the <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. ཁ་བཏགས] A Tibetan ceremonial scarf given to lamas, visitors, etc.">khata</span> similarly like the old one did and said, "Sir, please allow me to attend the inauguration ceremony." [Tib. སྐུ་ཞབས། གསར་པའི་ཁྲི་འདོན་རིང་ཡོང་ཆོག་པ་ཅིག]. He asked this because it was the time of the summer retreat [Tib. ཡརྣེ]. Then they served tea and <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. གྲོ་མ་འབྲས་སིལ] A special dish consisting of sweetened rice, melted butter and wild sweet potatoes (gro ma).">droma dresi</span> and the old shengos returned and the people coming to offer the khata (of congratulations) to the new shengo rushed in like they offered khata to the general Yasor during the Mönlam. After that, the two new shengo would go for a pilgrimage in the <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. གྲྭ་ཚང] A &quot;college&quot; within a monastery, for example, in Drepung Monastery there were four main tratsang: Gomang, Loseling, Deyang and Ngagpa.

The Könyerpön would invite them into the place where the Könyerpön stays. After that, the shengo went to one's relatives or friends in Lhasa and then they returned to the monastery.   

**Q:**  They would not hold any ceremony in Lhasa, right?   

**A:**  Right. On the next day, they went to the Tema [Tib. བསྟན་མ] Deity and on the day after that, they went to the Gadong [Tib. དགའ་གདོང] Deity to ask for a prophecy. After that, the handing over from the old shengo to the new would be done in 7 days, and the Khembo Tripa would come as the witness (Tib. tröpang [སྤྲོད་དཔང]). Then the old and the new shengo would consult and the old would serve rice and the new would serve the droma and they would make the tea by turns.

After that, the new shengo would hold the inauguration ceremony and when the new ones came to the shengo's office, their friends would receive them with incense and another person would carry the shengo's staff which was placed on wheat in a tray. After that, they prayed saying words like, "In the sanctuary surrounded by snow mountains" [Tib. གངས་རི་ར་བས་བསྐོར་བའི་ཞིང་ཁམས་ན] etc. Then they beat gongs while the old shengo would hand over the staff to the new shengo. Then the old shengo would sit below and the new one would sit above while they beat the gong and then the old shengo went back with 4 <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. དགེ་གཡོག] Monk assistant to the disciplinary official (gegö) in monasteries.">geyog</span> and 6 <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. ཐབ་གཡོག] Monks or laymen who work as servants/manual laborers in kitchens (normally monastic kitchens).">thabyog</span> escorting them yelling, "Make way!"

At this time, both of them had their padding on, but after that they took it off and they could go wherever they wanted.   

**Q:**  Then the new shengo would bring the big satin <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. ཐང་ཀ] A Tibetan scroll painting.">thanka</span>, right?

**Q:**  Where would the new one's stand while the old ones were going around with the incense?   

**A:**  The new shengo would stand in the monk's row while holding their staffs.   

**Q:**  At this time, did the old shengo have their staffs?   

**A:**  No. They just went around with the incense while still wearing the padding on their shoulders.

**A:**  Yes.   

**Q:**  How much did they have to spend for the inauguration ceremony?

**Q:**  Were there some shengo who didn't have particular <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. མི་ཚན] A sub-unit of a khamtsen.">mitsen</span>?   

**A:**  Some of their <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. མི་ཚན] A sub-unit of a khamtsen.">mitsen</span> was scattered at long distances, so they couldn't help them. If the mitsen was nearby, they went to help.   

**Q:**  Where would they hand over the charter?   

**A:**  They would hand it over in the Longevity Temple [Tib. ཚེ་དཔག་ལྷ་ཁང] on the roof top of the tsogchen. In that temple, they had an image of the 5th Dalai Lama, so they handed it over in front of the good-luck image.

But the Loseling Chabu were appointed by the government. In early times, they were not appointed by the government and they came from the relevant tratsang, but later [this changed] when Loseling created a disturbance [Tib. ཟིང་འཁྲུག] against the government.   

**Q:**  It was during the 13th Dalai Lama's time when the monk with flat nose nicknamed Anjam Nale [Tib. an 'jam ? sna leb] was there, right?   

**A:**  Yes. And it was caused by the [three <span class "tooltip" data-text "[tib. ཕྱག་སྦུག] A manager (of estates and endowments) of a monastic college or monastic khamtsen.">chabu</span>] the <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. ཚ་ཕྱག] The chabu (manager) of Tsha Khamtsen in Drepung Monastery.">Tshaja</span>, Phuja and Kongja. There was a lot of talk about the Drönyerchemmo called Abso. And probably there were also a lot of talk regarding Tengyeling, but I don't know that in detail. Then the Drönyerchemmo called them to come to his house. ... [unclear] At that time I was a child. Probably the 3 chabu were called to the <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. འགག] 1. Abbreviation of Tsega, the Secretariat Office of the Dalai Lama.">gaa</span> and when they were going there, the servant [Tib. söpön] of the <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. སྡེ་ཡངས] One of the colleges in Drepung Monastery.">Deyang</span> Tsenshab was standing at Gyetse Luding and he told the three chabu, "Do not go to <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. ནོར་བུ་གླིང་ཁ] The summer palace of the Dalai Lama.">Norbulinga</span> to see the Drönyerchemmo because if you see him today, it will be not good at all for you, so go back to the monastery." But the Tshaja being a <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. ཁམས་པ] A person from the Kham region, a Tibetan from the Khamba (Khampa) sub-cultural group.">Khamba</span> said, "No matter whatever is going to happen good or bad, let's go." So they went to the gaa, but the Drönyerchemmo was not there. Then when they went to his house, the Chemmo had gone to <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. ཞོལ་པ] 1. The Tibetan government office responsible for law and order in Shöl (tib. ཞོལ), the walled town beneath the Potala, as well as for 18 districts (tib. རྫོང) around Lhasa. It handled mainly criminal cases including murder. 2. The head of the Shölpa leygung.">Shölpa</span> and had left a message telling them to come to Shölpa. Actually, they were to be arrested when they went there. The Chemmo was upstairs and locked them in the prison called Panding for three days. He had deployed soldiers all around there. Then they were banished wearing white chupas. The Tshaja was whipped and had shackles and a cangue put on for his entire life (Tib. ཙེགོ་ཙེཇ [Tib. ཚེ་སྒོ་ཚེ་ལྕགས]. He was banished to [unclear] ཤིག་ཐེ་ཕུཇ་ཝས་བནིཤེད་ཏོ་ཐོ [Tib. དོ་བ] ཛོང and he had to go through the <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. རམ་མ་སྒང] A ferry site on the Lhasa River south of Lhasa City.">Ramagang</span> ferry site. As for the Kongja, they just fined him and let him return to the monastery. The Tshaja was banished, but the monks didn't know that and were waiting for him to come back. After they knew that the Tshaja had been banished, the monks rushed out [of the monastery to Norbulinga] and did all sorts of lawless and unprincipled things (Tib. trimey lugmey [Tib. ཁྲིམས་མེད་ལུགས་མེད] on the stage of Norbulinga, And they defecated in between the flowers there. When Shölkang came outside and told them that he will report this, the monks said "You old man keep quite, we have to say three words to the Dalai Lama. Please meet us [Tib. ཙིག་གསུམ་ཞུ་རྒྱུ་ཡོད། ཟུར་མཇལ་གནང་རོགས] [Tib. སྤོ་ལགས་ཁྱེད་རང་གིས་གའི་ཤེས་ཀྱི་མ་རེད། ང་ཚོ་རྒྱལ་བ་རིན་པོ་ཆེ་མཇལ་དགོས་ཡོད། ཁྱུག་ཙམ་ཞལ་མཇལ་གནང་རོགས་གནང། ཚིག་གསུམ་ཞུ་རྒྱུ]. The Dalai Lama was agitated by this. Anyway, Tsögo [Tib. མཚོ་སྒོ] [ཐེ་གེནེརལ] took his troops and went through Damba [Tib. དན་འབག] village [ཏོ་དྲེཔུང] and སལུངང [Tib. ས་ལུང་བ] [ཨནོཐེར་གེནེརལ] went through <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. གནས་ཆུང] 1.

The monks had piled stones on the roofs and they attached cleavers on sticks. They were supposed to hit people with that. Then I remember that there was a hailstorm and heavy rain which made the gorge much bigger. They went to ask the deity Tema for a prophecy and Tema said that she turned a vase of water upside down which caused a very severe hailstorm which even killed dogs, crows and hawks. It was also said that some people were driven away by the water and the war stopped [Tib. དམག་ཐག་ཆོད]. The monks couldn't come down and the soldiers also couldn't charge up because of the hailstorm. After the sky cleared, the Dalai Lama send an edict (Tib. ཀཡིག [བཀའ་ཡིག] saying do not shoot at Drepung. Even if they attack, you are not allowed to counter attack [Tib. མར་དགྲ་བྱས་ཀྱང། ཡར་རྒྱག་མི་ཆོག]. After this nobody fired guns.

Drönyerchemmo Abso lived in Tsomönling and when people came to visit him they would say, "Today his mood is not good so you should not see him." Since that time, the chabu were appointed by the government. I remember that the late Tshaja would tell us, "When I was appointed Tshaja, དྲུཉིཆེམམོ་ཏེམཔ་ཏརྒྱེ [Tib. བསྟན་པ་དར་རྒྱས] gave the following order, "According to the order from the Dalai Lama's secretariat (Tib. གཟིམ་ཆུང་ག) and mainly in order not to have Buddhism shaken and to adhere to the government, we are giving this [position of Tshaja and Phuja] to the nearby <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. གྲྭ་རྒྱུན] Monks who came to Drepung, Ganden and Sera from far distances such as Kham and Amdo.">tragyün</span> [monks from Central Tibet]."

The Tshaja also said, "However, when the Dalai Lama was no more, they acted according to the changed situation (Tib. ནེདü་ཙི [གནས་དུས་བརྩིས])".

However, mainly it was not given by the regent Reting. The 13th Dalai Lama was agitated because of the Loseling revolt, so when Loseling built the new house in the year when I was born, they reported this to the Dalai Lama asking him to do the consecration [Tib. རབ་གནས་དགེ་ལེགས་ཆར་འབེབས], but he didn't give an answer. This was after the <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. ཚ་ཕྱག] The chabu (manager) of Tsha Khamtsen in Drepung Monastery.">Tshaja</span> and Phuja were banished After that, all of a sudden the Dalai Lama went to <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. རྩེ] The Potala Palace.">Tse</span> and then stayed one week in Drepung Monastery. The Dalai Lama was pleased and he send a letter through the stable boy [Tib. ཆིབས་གཡོག] to bring <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. ཏམ་ཀ་དཀར་པོ] A unit in the traditional Tibetan currency system that was equal to 4 sang.

Then the Dalai Lama said that the Tshaja can come back to the monastery, [unclear] however, when the letter was sent to the Tshaja saying that he could come back, it was said that he had died. Anyway, he was killed or died there and he couldn't come back. Then the Dalai Lama gave the order through Chemmo saying that Loseling can make whatever report directly through the Chemmo, but they didn't dare to report. However, later the Dalai Lama again repeated the same order and asked, "Don't you have anything to report?" And then they petitioned asking to get their estates (chöshi) [that were confiscated] back. At that time, Gyaritsel estate [Tib. རྒྱ་རི་ཚལ] belonged to [tsidrung] Kogpentse and Norbugang [Tib. ནོར་བུ་སྒང] belonged to Trekhang [Tib. འབྲས་ཁང] who became Kyabing [Tib. སྐྱབས་དབྱིངས] [the Dewashung governor in Tashilhunpo] and the Gyantse Mesong [?] estate belonged to Tsarong. All of these had gotten the endorsement for their ownership. In the beginning, they had the priest-patron relationship with Loseling, but later they asked for the estates and got the ownership and they could give whatever amount [of grain] they wanted to Loseling. Later, during the 13th Dalai Lama, he decided to cancel all of these land tenure documents and return the religious estate (chöshi) to Loseling. This plan was made but the approval was yet to be given when the Dalai Lama passed away. Later, they reported this to Reting regent and he asked the <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. འགག] 1. Abbreviation of Tsega, the Secretariat Office of the Dalai Lama.">gaa</span> about this. They reported that the Dalai Lama had decided to return the estates. Then the <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. ཚོགས་འདུ་རྒྱས་འཛོམས] The largest assembly of the traditional Tibetan government.">tsondu gyendzom</span> was held and they approved the 13th Dalai Lama's decision and retuned all the estates to Loseling. Later the chabu gave 2 <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. ཁལ] A traditional volume measurement used for measuring grain in traditional Tibetan society. Sizes of this unit varied somewhat, but the official government khe (called mkhar ru or bstan dzin mkha ru) weighed about 28-31 pounds for barley. It was used to convey the size of fields. For example, a field said to be 10 khe in size meant that 10 khe of seed could be sown on that field.">khe</span> of grain and 150 sang and the bungdzö gave 3 khe of grain and 5 dotse to each monk in one day. And they invited the Dalai Lama to the tsog [Tib. ཚོགས་ཕེབས].

There, the 2 shengo would give him a khata and they would go through the motions of saying, "Now, we are your new boss?" The chagdampa would tell the other people in the shengo's office, "He is the new gegö." Until the 9th lunar month, there was no work. On the 2nd of the 9th month, the gegö started working.

I could just barely get them balanced so I didn't need to take loans and got the fame of being a gegö. Since I became the gegö, I don't need to pull down my shawl as a salute when I went to see the <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. མཁན་པོ] Abbot of a monastery or monastic college.">khembo</span> and in the <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. ཕྱག་སྦུག] A manager (of estates and endowments) of a monastic college or monastic khamtsen.">chabu</span>'s office and I would be called mister. If an ordinary monk went to the chabu's office, they would make him stand. Also, if there were some important work to do, they would let them sit on a round cushion (Tib. དེནཀོར [གདན་སྐོར]).

The gegö would give them orders while they were standing. After the giving of orders was over, the gegö would tell the chagdampa and shingnyer to sit and they would chitchat. The geyog would be told to go out to the next room and sit there. I was the one to whom the <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. ཆབ་རིལ] The Chabril&#x27;s main work was overseeing serving the traja. He was also the servant of the gegö and khempo.

After the evening tea, the shengo would send the chabril to call me and I would have to go to the temple where the 16 Arhats [Tib. གནས་བརྟན་བཅུ་དྲུག] were located almost every alternative days when the shengo were practicing giving orders. I would bang the table if the shengo made mistakes when giving orders and I would make corrections. After that, we would come back to the shengo's office and chitchat until 11-12 p.m. Also, the shengo would give suggestions and make comments regarding my chagdampa work. Although I can't really say it, in reality I was their [shengo's] teacher and all of them would seek my advice. I was also called by the <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. སྒོ་མང] One of the large colleges in Drepung Monastery.">Gomang</span> and <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. སྡེ་ཡངས] One of the colleges in Drepung Monastery.">Deyang</span> shengos to ask me things.

[Tib. ལས་ཀ་གྲ་འགྲིག་པོ་བྱུང་ན་། རྒྱལ་པོ་ཨ་ནེས་བྱས་ཀྱང་ཁྱད་པར་མེད]. Some Gomang shengo would tell me, "In Gomang, we only have people who cause trouble, so please tell us truthfully what we should do." And some would say in a kidding manner, "Uncle! Please, don't let us down." [Tib. ཨ་ཁུ། ཀོ་ཐག་མ་གློད་རོགས་བྱེད]. I would also teach them privately what to do. There was one late geyog called Tharchin La [Tib. མཐར་ཕྱིན་ལགས] who had been the geyog since he was 18 years old. That was the year when there was the Wood-Dragon British war. He would tell me, "You are the only [capable] one among the four of them [the 2 shengo and 2 chagdampa]." He had lot of things to tell about how the 13th Dalai Lama went to China and India. He taught me a lot. Therefore, all people trusted that I was familiar with things [customs and rules]. When the <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. སྤྲུལ་སྐུ] An incarnate lama.">trülku</span> did their inauguration ceremony, they would always call me and ask me about the rules of the inauguration ceremony, and when they held the <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. དགེ་ཤེས] An advanced degree earned by scholar monks.">geshe</span> exams, etc. Almost all the trülku called me when they did those things.
