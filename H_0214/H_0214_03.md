## Abstract  

 Urgyen [Tib. ཨོ་རྒྱན] was a well-known Drepung Loseling monk who at one time held the powerful position of Chagdampa. In this interview, he discusses the famous incident that involved the imprisonment and banishment of the Loseling Chabu and the monks of Loseling coming en-mass as a mob to Norbulinga to shout at the Dalai Lama. This led to the army being sent to Drepung. He also discusses the period after the death of the Thirteenth Dalai Lama and then how Trimön came to Drepung to seek protection during the Lungshar incident. Then he starts to discuss the bitter dispute between the Shatra main family and Tsag Serkhang and Shatra's daughter.

**Q:**  [section missing] The name of the Tsaja was Khyenrab Tenkyong [Tib. མཁྱེན་རབ་བསྟན་སྐྱོང] and the name of the Shengo was Ada [Tib. ཨ་ཐར].   

**A:**  His real name was Lobsang Tsering [Tib. བློ་བཟང་ཚེ་རིང], but he was widely known as Shengo Ada.   

**Q:**  Then what happened?   

**A:**  I don't have any details to tell you because I was a child then.   

**Q:**  Then all 4 chabu were summoned by the Drönyerchemmo, right?   

**A:**  At that time, three of the chabu were going down and there was also the kongja. The Deyang Tsenshab probably sent his servant [Tib. söpön] to the front of Luding [Tib. ཀླུ་ལྡིང] and told him, "Three of the Loseling chabu are coming down [from Drepung monastery], so wait near the road and tell them, "If you are going to Norbulinga today, you should not go [Tib. ཕེབས་རྒུ་མི་འདུག]. You should go back to the monastery. If you come today it will not be good [Tib. ཡག་པོ་ཡོང་བ་མི་འདུག] for you to visit the Drönyerchemmo in Norbulinga. I heard that when the servant was waiting there, the 3 chabu came and he told them that he was sent by Tsenshab Rimpoche and that Tsenshab Rimpoche said you should not go to Norbulinga. So they stopped their horses and discussed what to do. Then the Tsaja said, "Now, we have already come to this place, so whatever good or bad is going to happen, let's go on." So the three of them agreed and went to the Drönyerchemmo's house. However, he was not there and the person in the Drönyerchemmo's house said that he had gone to the Shölpa [office] and delivered the message that Chemmo (Drönyerchemmo) said that you [chabu] should come to Shölpa. Then they went to the Shölpa, but Chemmo was waiting there for the monks and they were arrested right away without saying a single word to them. They were imprisoned in the Shöl Legung and soldiers were dispersed around there.   

**Q:**  Where did they spread out the soldiers?   

**A:**  They placed the soldiers on the right and the left side of the prison thinking that the monks will rush down [Tib. ལུག་ཡོང་བསམ] [to free the chabu]. After they were arrested, they didn't tell them anything, and then on the next day, probably they issued the verdict and told them, "You know what you have done." [Tib. ག་རེ་བྱས་མིན་ཁྱེད་རང་ཚོའི་བློ་མངའ་རེད]. Probably they did it like was done in Kapshöba's case. They banished the Tsaja to Chayü [Tib. བྱ་ཡུལ] and the Phuja to Lhobrag Tho Dzong [Tib. ལྷོ་བྲག་དོ་རྫོང] and the Kongja was returned to the monastery saying that he was innocent.   

**Q:**  What was the root (Tib. ཙཝ [རྩ་བ]) cause of that incident?   

**A:**  It was said that it was caused by Ada.   

**Q:**  What was the reason for having the law case?   

**A:**  Probably, the cause was Böde Janglojen [Tib. སྦུད་བདེ་ལྕང་ལོ་ཅན].   

**Q:**  You mean it was about that estate?   

**A:**  Yes.   

**Q:**  How did that happen?   

**A:**  I don't know how that happened. Anyway, the famous Shengo Lhaula [Tib. ལྷ་བུ་ལགས] held the estate of Janglojen [Tib. ལྕང་ལོ་ཅན] and then Ada took it over from Lhaula. In the beginning, the Tsaja gave the estate to Ada and then he took it back from Ada and gave it to Lhaula. Then the Tsaja and Lhaula joined together [Tib. ཁ་སྒྲིལ] and they might have hated Ada. Ada's backer was the Drönyerchemmo. When this matter was reported to the Drönyerchemmo, it became kind of widespread and Loseling might have said a lot of things [Tib. ལོ་རྒྱུས་མང་པོ་བཤད་ཡོད་ཀྱི་རེད་པ] [words unclear] and [the drönyerchemmo] used this as an excuse (Tib. ཉེཏག [བསྙད་བཏགས]) and in two days the Tsaja was banished. They were waiting for the Tsaja and Phuja to come back [to Loseling] but found out that they had been banished when the Kongja came back. Then they knew what had happened so they sent the two chabu clothing and stuff. The Tsaja was whipped and dressed in a white chupa and banished. He had to go through Jowo Ragyga [Tib. ཇོ་བོ་རག་རྒྱབ] [the east side of Lhasa] because he was to go to Lhoka. The Phuja went through the Ramagang ferry site because he was to go to Lhobrag. As soon as he crossed the ferry, probably there was a corvée horse waiting there for him. I am not sure whether he was wearing a white chupa. Before he mounted the horse, he said, "I am not going to ride the horse. First I am going to make three prostrations." He prostrated 3 times towards the monastery and three times towards the Potala. Just before he mounted his horse he lifted one of his legs and then said wait a minute and then he fell down and died right there. So he didn't have go into banishment after crossing Ramagang. I am not sure whether it was because he had attained freedom from the karmic law of cause and effect [Tib. ལས་ལ་རང་དབང་ཐོབ་པ]. The Kongja returned to the monastery, but he and the other monastic officials (Tib. lene [las sne] didn't have any power [over the monks who were angry]. Many monks gathered and took the keys and met in Kadrug [a house?]. They spoke bombastically and bragged a lot. They said we must do this and that and we should kill and chop them [for doing that] [Tib. གཏོང་དགོས་རེད། བྱུག་དགོས་རེད་གསོད་དགོས་རེད་གཏུབ་དགོས་རེད]. This was said by the monks nicknamed Jönga Gyawu [Tib. བཅོ་ལྔ་རྒྱའུ], Nyagre Gyawu [Tib. ཉག་རེ་རྒྱའུ] and Anjam Nale [Tib. ཨ་འཇམ་སྣ་ལེབ]. [unclear section] After that, many ordinary monks [Tib. ཏྲམང] made a commotion [Tib. འུར] and left to go to Norbulinga. The Nechung monks went to stop them at the base of the mountain that was called Nyena Risur, but they didn't listen. They even urinated on the flowers [in Norbulinga]. When the monks reached Norbulinga, the Lönchen Shölkang came out and said to the monks, "What are you here for? Tell me and I will report it." But the monks said, "Old man, you don't know anything. We want to meet the Dalai Lama and make a report to him. Please let us meet him a for a very short time. We have three words to report." [Tib. སྤོ་ལགས་ཁྱེད་རང་གིས་གའི་ཤེས་ཀྱི་མ་རེད། ང་ཚོ་རྒྱལ་བ་རིན་པོ་ཆེ་མཇལ་དགོས་ཡོད། ཁྱུག་ཙམ་ཞལ་མཇལ་གནང་རོགས་གནང། ཚིག་གསུམ་ཞུ་རྒྱུ་ཡོད]   

**Q:**  How many monks rushed out [from the monastery to Norbulinga]?   

**A:**  Probably, there were about 100 monks.   

**Q:**  No, there were more than that. About 1,000.   

**A:**  I don't think there were 1,000. Then the Lönchen made the report and he [the Dalai Lama] was agitated (Tib. གོངཆོག་ཏྲུག [དགོངས་ཕྱོགས་འཁྲུགས] and wouldn't meet them, right? [unclear] Anyway, Tsögo [a depön] took his troops and went through Damba [Tib. དན་འབག] [the village below Drepung] and སལུངང [Tib. ས་ལུང་བ] [a depön] [with his troops] went through Nechung [next to Drepung monastery]. I remember them [the soldiers] blowing bugles. The monks put stones on the rooftops [in preparation for stoning them from there (Tib. dzogdo lö [རྫོག་རྡོ་གློད])] and they attached cleavers to sticks/poles. They were to be used to hit people. Then I remember that there was a hailstorm and heavy rain which made the gorge much bigger.   

**Q:**  Didn't they say that they went to ask the deity Tema [Tib. བསྟན་མ] for a prophecy?   

**A:**  I didn't know whether they went to ask Tema for a prophecy right at that time. However, I heard later that Tema said that she turned a vase of water upside down which caused very severe hailstorm that even killed dogs. I don't know if that was true or not.   

**Q:**  I heard that many soldiers were driven away by the water, right?   

**A:**  The soldiers were probably not driven away by the water, but the war stopped [Tib. དམག་ཐག་ཆོད]. The monks couldn't come down and the soldiers also couldn't charge up because of the hailstorm. After the sky cleared, the Dalai Lama send an edict (Tib. kayig [bka' yig] saying do not fire on Drepung. Even if they attack you, you are not allowed to counter-attack [Tib. མར་དགྲ་བྱས་ཀྱང། ཡར་རྒྱག་མི་ཆོག], so nobody fired guns. After that, all of the ringleaders were arrested.   

**Q:**  How did they arrest them?   

**A:**  I heard Anjam Nale was playing dice in a cave somewhere in Gemphel [Tib. དགེ་འཕེལ] [the mountain top above Drepung]. After that, the monk prisoners were handed over to kudrak families like Serkhang, Shatra, Shölkang, Tsarong, Ditru Labrang, Trimön, Reting and the Tsomönling Labrang [they had to kept in detention in their houses]. There were`about 60 prisoners who were marched through the Barkor Street in a line wearing leg shackles. Later, I think the government followed this example at the time of the Sera Jey incident (in 1947). After that, I don't know what the Drepung Laji did. Almost all the incumbent abbots were demoted. At that time, Basog [Tib. བྲག་གསེབ] Lama must have been the incumbent abbot of Gomang College. The Gomang monks have names starting with Ngawang which was half of the abbot's name. Basog was also demoted.   

**Q:**  Did they arrest the abbots?   

**A:**  Probably not. Basog stayed in Tsomönling until the death of the [13th] Dalai Lama and then he died. The Drepung Laji might have supported the monks, so he [the Dalai Lama] might have said this was a serious violation. Later, I heard that they requested that the selection of the Tsaja and Phuja return to the previous custom of them being appointed from among the monks from nearby [i.e., not from Kham and Amdo, etc.]. Since that time, the Tsaja and Phuja were appointed by the government. The late Tsaja would quote that order as follows, "According to the order from the Dalai Lama's secretariat and mainly in order not to have Buddhism shaken and to listen to the government, we are giving this [the position of Tsaja and Phuja] to the monks from nearby areas."[Tib. གཟིམ་ཆུང་འགག་གི་བཀའ་སྒྱུར་དགོངས་དོན། གཙོ་ཆེན་སངས་རྒྱས་བསྟན་པ་ཡོ་འཁྱོམ་མི་འབྱུང་བའི་ཆེད་དང་གཞུང་ས་དགའ་ལྡན་ཕོ་བྲང་ལ་སྤྱི་བཀུར་ཞུ་ཆེད་ཉེ་སྐོར་གྲྭ་རྒྱུན་ལ་གསོལ་རས་བསྩལ་བ་ཡིན]. The Tsaja also said, "However, when the Dalai Lama was no more [died], they did it according to the situation (Tib. nedütsi [gnas dus brtsis]".   

**Q:**  Are you referring to the Tsaja who died last year?   

**A:**  No, before him, there had been three Tsaja. The Tsaja who died a few years ago in India was the person who was appointed at the time that I was the number one candidate. When I referred to the late Tsaja, I meant the Tsaja called [Utö] Yeshe Champa [Tib. དབུས་སྟོད་ཡེ་ཤེས་བྱམས་པ]. He was a short man. Later he became the ex-chabu and we petitioned Reting and told him that we did not request that the 13th Dalai Lama give the Tsaja position only to monks from nearby areas [Central Tibet] [Tib. phöba]. We didn't offer the 13th Dalai Lama a scarf and a Mendredensum to get the Tsaja appointment only for persons who were born near Lhasa. This rule was given by the 13th Dalai Lama on his own.   

**Q:**  Why did it become necessary for you to make this petition?   

**A:**  Because the Khambas were insisting that they would like to get the Tsaja position. The Kalön Lama Tempa Jayan was a drunyichemmo at that time, so we went and saw Tempa Jayan. From his attitude, I thought he was very much against us, but now, when I think of it, it was not because he was against Loseling, but earlier he was a khenjung and then he became a Tseja. From that position, he was demoted and his property was sealed. So he didn't like Kujar [Künphel la]. That was why.   

**Q:**  Who didn't he like Kujar?   

**A:**  Tempa Jayan, the Kalön Lama, didn't like Kujar. Because of that, he told us, "There is no use for you to come here. For what purpose are you coming here? This is my personal house. This is not the Yigtsang office of the government [where he worked]. Whatever you have to say, you should go to the Yigtsang and say it there. This is my personal house. Moreover, the work of the chabu is work for Loseling College and not a matter of Buddhism [Tib. བསྟན་དོན], so there is no need to deal with it in the office. Whoever becomes the chandzö, whether it is a khamba or a phöba (central Tibetan), what difference does that make?" We thought that probably the Khambas should now [again] be candidates for the Tsaja position so we made this appeal. At that time I was grown up and I was one of the representatives who went to make the appeal. The late Tsaja who died was also there. I mean we all got together even though we had been fighting in the past. We got together and talked and we waited together [for an answer]. Whenever they called, we went and gave an explanation by ourselves. Sometimes we would go and see the drunyichemmo personally in their houses and offer them gifts. This was during the time of the four drunyichemmo: Dombor, Shide Lobsang Wangyal [Tib. བཞི་སྡེ་བློ་བཟང་དབང་རྒྱལ], Tempa Kelsang [Tib. བསྟན་པ་སྐལ་བཟང] who was from Gomang, and the last one was Tempa Jayan.   

**Q:**  Were these the four drunyichemmo in office when the 13th Dalai Lama died?   

**A:**  No. Tempa Jayan was appointed by Reting after the death of the 13th Dalai Lama. Out of these four drunyichemmo, Dombor, Tempa Kelsang and Shide Lobsang Wangyal were appointed by the Dalai Lama. Tempa Jayan was appointed by Reting Rimpoche.   

**Q:**  When Reting became the regent, one drunyichemmo was not there. Who was that? Was that the Ta Lama?   

**A:**  At that time there was no Ta Lama. After the death of the Muru [Tib. རྨེ་རུ] Ta Lama, there was no Ta Lama for a long period. No Ta Lama at all.   

**Q:**  Did the 13th Dalai Lama appoint a Ta Lama after the death of the Muru Ta Lama?   

**A:**  Probably for ten years there was no Ta Lama. However, later Dingkhang [Tib. ལྡིང་ཁང] Drunyichemmo become a Ta Lama.  

**Q:**  Was he appointed by the 13th?   

**A:**  Yes. The 13th appointed Dingkhang as drunyichemmo. Then Dingkhang died and again for 5 or 6 years there was no Ta Lama at all.   

**Q:**  When the 13th Dalai Lama died was Dingkhang a Drunyichemmo, a Ta Lama?   

**A:**  Yes. After that Reting didn't appoint any Ta Lama.   

**Q:**  Why?   

**A:**  I don't know, but he didn't appoint anyone. Later Ramba became Ta Lama. I think Ramba was the first Ta Lama after that.   

**Q:**  Who appointed Ramba?   

**A:**  Reting appointed him.   

**Q:**  When Dingkhang Ta Lama died, did Reting appoint Ramba as a drunyichemmo?   

**A:**  Yes. And after Ramba, it was Jawdang.   

**Q:**  How did that happen?   

**A:**  At that time, Dombor was the most eligible and was also the most senior. Ramba was junior. But Reting did not appoint Dombor as Ta Lama because he didn't like him. So he appointed Ramba. According to seniority, Dombor should have been appointed, but Dombor was not given the chance to become Ta Lama because [Reting] probably didn't like Dombor. Among the drunyichemmo, they had to perform various rituals, i.e., being the Shabden Dodampa [Tib. ཞབས་བརྟན་དོ་དམ་པ] by turns for the benefit of the government. So they needed to have some money for the expenditures. So it was the turn of Dombor to become the Shabden Dodampa and Ramba was the second in line. Ramba said, "Dombor is the senior official so he should become the Shabden Dodampa." However, Dombor replied, "Yes, I am the senior-most and it is my turn, but I am not a Ta Lama and Ramba Künkhyen is the Ta Lama, therefore Ramba should do it." [unclear] This is the way they were supposed to have talked.   

**Q:**  When the 13th Dalai Lama died, where were you?   

**A:**  I had been sent to India to do trading by my late maternal aunt.   

**Q:**  Had you reached the age for doing trading?   

**A:**  Yes. I was already 14 years old. At that time, there was a servant of Tsarong called Tempa Chödrag [Tib. བསྟན་པ་ཆོས་གྲགས].   

**Q:**  You say your maternal aunt. She was my grandmother, right?   

**A:**  Yes. She has died.   

**Q:**  I remember there was an old man there [with my grandmother].   

**A:**  He was the older brother of Kundeling Dzasa.   

**Q:**  Some say I am related to Kundeling Dzasa and some say not.   

**A:**  You are not related to Kundeling Dzasa because they [their family] were katsara [half Tibetan-Nepalese].   

**A:**  However, Kundeling Dzasa himself was not a katsara. He was the brother of Lhading's [Tib. ལྷ་ལྡིང] servant Lungta [Tib. རླུང་རྟ] who was the father of tsidrung Temba Söpa [Tib. བསྟན་པ་བཟོད་པ]. When I was coming back from India, we spent the night in Ralung. The next day we were going to Dzara [Tib. རྫ་ར] and Nangkartse [Tib. སྣང་དཀར་རྩེ]. When we were taking a break in Dzara, we saw a few of those Muslim businessmen. We had the small bells on the necks of our mules. We knew those Muslim people, and when we were about to leave they told us, "I don't think you should use the bells on the horses and mules. I think you have to take them off." Then we told them, "Everybody is using them, why not?" He told us, "We heard that the Dalai Lama has died." This was the first time I heard about the death of the Dalai Lama. Then we took off those bells and we cried. When we reached Nangkartse, we saw that the Nangkartse monastery had removed all their decorations and even their banner on the rooftop was removed. All the people around had removed their earrings. By the time we were about to reach Lhasa, nobody was even wearing the long earring [Tib. སོག་བྱིལ]. All the Shape were wearing white chupa.   

**Q:**  What do you mean by "white chupa"?   

**A:**  Those were white [satin] brocade chupas. All the kudrak did not wear their earrings. This was only for about two weeks or fifteen days. Then they again put the banners up. That was called, the "Good news banner" [Tib. གཏམ་སྙན་དར་ལྕོག]. It was the good news that Reting was going to be the regent. Again they started to put up flags, etc. They were called "good news flags."   

**Q:**  There was a long time between these two events. The Dalai lama died on the 30th of the 10 month and Reting became Regent the 11th of the 1st month. Is that right?   

**A:**  Yes, it was in the 1st month.   

**Q:**  When the Dalai Lama died and you reached Lhasa, what was Kujar doing?   

**A:**  Kujar was yet to be arrested.   

**Q:**  How long did it take you to get [unfinished remark]   

**A:**  Kujar was yet to be arrested. At that time there was no talk about Kujar's arrest. Then one day they said that Kujar had been arrested. Then several Lhasa people sang a song with the words, "In the British car, the person who controls the three realms/ Kujar the son of gods/ tell us where did he go?"] [Tib. སྦི་ལར་མོ་ཏྲའི་ནང་གི། མི་ཕོ་ཁམས་གསུམ་དབང་འདུས། སྐུ་བཅར་ལྷ་ཡི་སྲས་ཕོ། གར་སོང་ཤོད་རོགས་གནང་དང].   

**Q:**  Then what happened?   

**Q:**  We heard that Kujar was put in Sharchenjog [prison] in Tse and that his father was arrested and jailed in Nangtsesha. That is what I heard, but I didn't see them being locked up. At that time, there was a chandzö from Sera Jey nicknamed "small fatty" (Gyagchungla [Tib. རྒྱགས་ཆུང་ལགས]). He was also locked up for about a month. They said that he was related to Kujar.   

**Q:**  Was he exiled later?   

**A:**  No. He was returned to the monastery. Maybe he was not involved. Kujar and his father were sent [to regions] up and down at the same time and they were supposed to be both seen at Sabogang [Tib. ས་སྦོག་སྒང] at the front of the Jokhang [as they left for exile], but they could not talk to each other. One was taken this way, and the other that way. Another song about Kujar said, "The car backed up and arrived at Sharchenjog." [Tib. མོ་ཏྲས་རྐུབ་འཚག་བརྒྱབས་ནས། ཤར་ཆེན་ལྕོག་ལ་སླེབས་སོང]. At that time Trimön was the senior Shape and had become the official in charge of building the golden stupa for keeping the remains of the Dalai Lama [Tib. གསེར་སྡོང་ཆེན་མོ].   

**Q:**  The drunyichemmo in charge of building the golden stupa was Dingkhang, right?   

**A:**  Dingkhang was dead then. It was Ramba who was in charge of building the golden stupa. Among the drunyichemmo, it was only Dingkhang who was the best kind of person. Drunyichemmo Shide Lobsang Wangyal was very bad. The moment we visited him about the Tsaja's case   

**Q:**  Was that about the case when the Tsaja was banished?   

**A:**  No, it was for the appointment of the new Tsaja. At that time, Lobsang Wangyal was the drunyichemmo. The Tsaja changes every two or three years, so we talked about the new appointment of a Tsaja. We had to go to see the drunyichemmo. It was he who had kept the flower pots behind him in the room. He had closed the curtains on the windows and made the room dark. He was sitting on one side and on the table on the other side he was keeping all the flower pots. We were scared to look up at him. We went straight up to the table where he normally would have been staying. I put my scarf there and started to talk to him. Actually I put my scarf near the flower pots and started talking. There was no reply for a long time. Then after some time, the man started replying from my back side. When I looked he was sitting on the other side. This is an example. The drunyichemmo was sitting at the back and I was showing my back to him while putting the scarf down and talking.   

**Q:**  This is enough about the Kujar incident. Do you remember anything about Lungshar?   

**A:**  Lungshar's eyes were gouged out, but I didn't see it. There were a lot of problems. It was during Reting's period.   

**Q:**  Before they arrested Lungshar, Trimön came to Drepung. He came to Drepung Tsetang, right?   

**A:**  He came there because Thubden Chömpel [Tib. ཐུབ་བསྟན་ཆོས་འཕེལ] was there.   

**Q:**  Normally, when a Shape came to Drepung, the abbots and the Laji had to go to greet him, right?   

**A:**  Yes.   

**Q:**  At that time, the abbot of Loseling was Lhopa Khembo, right?   

**A:**  Yes, it was Lhopa Khembo. It was the beginning of Lhopa Khembo's period   

**Q:**  I forgot to ask you an important question. At the time of Kujar's fall, the Drönyerchemmo Kogpo died. At the same time, one abbot of Drepung was supposed to have died. Do you know about that?   

**A:**  No, I don't.   

**Q:**  I have heard it was the Dülwa Abbot who died, is that true?  

**A:**  I don't think the Dülwa Abbot died. There were two Dülwa Abbots. The Dülwa abbot who was the tutor to the Kundeling [Lama], the one with the white beard, probably he died. He is supposed to have died about that time.   

**Q:**  Was it the same night that Kogpo died?   

**A:**  I do not know whether it was the same night or not, but he is supposed to have died about that time. He was from Gomang. His voice had a thick northern, "Hor," accent and he used to tell the monks, "I don't have anything to say to make the clear clearer like the proverb, "You don't need to make the pea round again." [Tib. གསལ་པོ་དག་ལ་གསལ་སྐྱོར་རྒྱག་ཡག་མི་འདུག།ནག་ཆུང་སྲན་མར་དབྲིལ་སྐྱོར]. All the shengo and the geyog had to do good so that meritorious people would be appreciative [Tib. སྐལ་ལྡན་དང་བ་འདྲེན་པ]."   

**Q:**  Was he really the Dülwa Khembo?   

**A:**  Probably he was.   

**Q:**  Do you remember that Trimön came to Drepung during the Lungshar troubles?   

**A:**  Trimön came. I do remember something. I was at the stone floor [courtyard] of Drepung [just in front of Drepung] when Trimön came. At that time they were calling him "Trimön Shape." Anyway he was with many servants, many people. I was in a large group of people. When Trimön actually left his house he had kept it a secret [where he was going]. He had said that he was going to Norbulinga. However, when he was about to reach Norbulinga he told the men to go to Nechung. When he was about to reach Nechung, he said, "I am going to Drepung." So he stayed in his own house in Drepung and people came to see him there and he asked the Loseling monks to save his life.   

**Q:**  At that time, from Loseling, Trimön went to visit the Regent Reting and the Silön Langdün [Tib. གླང་མདུན], right?   

**A:**  No, I never heard this.   

**Q:**  When did the Lungshar trouble arise?   

**A:**  I heard Lungshar was arrested.   

**Q:**  Was this the same day?   

**A:**  No, it was not the same day. It was not the same day, it was much later.   

**Q:**  Is that true?  

**A:**  Yes, it was definitely after that.   

**Q:**  Is that true?  

**A:**  Yes.  

**Q:**  What is the reason that you think it was much later?   

**A:**  After a few days when I went to Lhasa I heard that Lungshar was arrested. It was at least ten days later.   

**Q:**  Did Trimön stay in Drepung for about four days? Did he stay in Drepung itself or did he go up to the Gemphel Ritrö [Tib. དགེ་འཕེལ་རི་ཁྲོད] hermitage [above Drepung]?   

**A:**  He stayed in Drepung and then he went up to Gemphel Ritrö. After that, Kyitöpa [Tib. སྐྱིད་སྟོད་པ] who was the older brother of Bumtang Drunyichemmo, Tsidrung Kongtrugla [Tib. ཀོང་ཕྲུག་ལགས], the lay official Gyenkhar Nangpa [Tib. རྒྱལ་མཁར་ནང་པ] and Gajang Tempa [Tib. མགར་བྱང་བསྟན་པ] were arrested, but they were not whipped. They were banished, being sent out from the main gate of Shingra near the Tsuglagang. They had`already their hair knots untied and the horse corvée had been brought there. At that time, I was just young so I didn't pay very much attention to that.  

**Q:**  There were no oxen, right?   

**A:**  Yes. And they didn't have to wear cangues. That much I can say.   

**Q:**  I heard that there was a song at that time with the words, "The bad result of the 29th was repaid on the 29th." [Tib. ཉི་ཤུ་དགུའི་ལག་གཡོག། ཉི་ཤུ་དགུ་ལ་བརྒྱབས་སོང]. This means the kujar was banished on the 29th and the verdict for Lungshar was also on the 29th, right?   

**A:**  I don't have anything to tell you about this song.   

**Q:**  After that, Janglojen Gung was also banished to Kongpo Tselagang [Tib. རྩེ་ལ་སྒང] and Künphel was banished in Chamnag [Tib. ཆབ་ནག], right?   

**A:**  Yes. It was said that Chapa Rusur [Tib. ཆ་པ་རུ་ཟུར], who was the son of Lungshar and used to be the Gusung Regiment's rupön, became the husband of Lady Shatra, right?   

**Q:**  No. He was the boyfriend of Shatra's daughter Lhayön [Tib. ལྷ་ཡོན]. They had a very serious law case, right?   

**A:**  No. He was demoted for being Lungshar's offspring. The law case of Tsag Serkhang [Tib. རྩག་སེར་ཁང] was long after.   

**Q:**  Lhayön La's law case was with the main Shatra family and it was before that. At that time, Shatra Ganden Paljor [Tib. དགའ་ལྡན་དཔལ་འབྱོར] was a child. After Tsag Serkhang and Chapa merged together, then there was the law case. This was settled during Taktra's reign.   

**A:**  At that time I was the Chagdampa. [unclear] If I tell you the root of it, it will take a long time.   

**Q:**  Please go ahead.   

**A:**  It was the time when one of the Shengo was named Ütö Yeshe Gyentsen [Tib. དབུས་སྟོད་ཡེ་ཤེས་རྒྱལ་མཚན] and the other was the Gomang Shengo Khechok [Tib. མཁས་མཆོག]. When the Mönlam was held, the seating arrangement [of the monks] was done on the 4th, and on the 5th or 6th the Shingnyer Chönzin [Tib. ཤིང་གཉེར་ཆོས་འཛིན] was at the back door [of the Jokhang] near the kitchen. When he came to check the tea at the time of the afternoon prayer ceremony [Tib. གོངཇ], I met him there. Liushar [Tib. སྣེའའུ་ཤར] [who] the Laja [was also there]. Chönzin told me, "There is a lot of talk so you should be very careful and stay quiet or it will not be good. They are doing lot of dealings. I said what's the matter? He said, "When I went to the firewood yard, on the way I went to Trijang [Tib. ཁྲི་བྱང] Labrang and I heard them saying that the Ganden monks who were sitting on the left and right side of the Rigsum Gombo chapel [Tib. རིགས་གསུམ་མགོན་པོ], were holding a meeting and they were saying there is a law case between the main and the branch families of Shatra and that tomorrow or the day after tomorrow, Tsag Serkhang is going to get married [to Shatra's daughter and try to take over the family]. If they get married, then Shatra's servants will stand behind the main Shatra family and the Ganden monks will also stand behind the main family [against Tsag Serkhang]. I heard that the two "sirs" (Tib. གུཤོ་ཉི [སྐུ་ཞབས་གཉིས]) [i.e., the 2 shengo] were already in cahoots [Tib. ཁ་རུལ] with Tsag Serkhang." When I asked how they came to be in cahoots, he said, "Tsag Serkhang had already gone to see the Gomang Shengo and they were in cahoots before the New Year [started]." Then [I recalled that] the Nangma of the junior Shengo was the son of Tsag Serkhang's steward who was named Paljor. And there was the Trendong steward named Tseden [Tib. རྩེ་བརྟན་ལ] who was a young guy from Tsang. The senior Shengo was the maternal uncle of his wife Jayan [Tib. འཇམ་དབྱངས] who had a shop under Ragashag's House. So both of the Shengo had a close internal relationship with Tsag Serkhang. Before that, I saw Tsag Serkhang's steward and Trendong's steward coming to the junior Shengo. They were talking a lot, but I was not paying that much attention. Chönzin also told me, "If you don't be alert, the Nangma might cause you trouble" [Tib. ཁྱེད་རང་སྦི་གསང་མ་གནང་ན། ནང་མས་མགོ་ལོག་བཟོས་ཡོང་ང]. Before that, I saw Tsag Serkhang's chandzö (steward) and Trendong's nyerpa (steward) coming to the junior Shengo, but I was not paying that much attention. After the evening tea when we were going on patrol, my relative, who was a clerk [Tib. shödrung in the Shöl Legung, was waiting for me in my office, the Shengo's office. He also told me, "You must be careful. The Ganden monks are holding a meeting and Tsag Serkhang is getting married." After hearing this, I was kind of alert and that evening when it was almost dark, I went out to urinate from the Shengo's office and I saw a few people standing and ཏལྐིང, like whispering, in front of the ladder [on my way to the toilet]. There were some thabyog, but they wouldn't say anything, right? When I went out from the Shengo's office to urinate, I saw that Tsag Serkhang's chandzö, Trendong Nyerpa and the junior Shengo were whispering to each other so I went back and took off my inner lower garment [Ch. zhan chun] and tied up my belts and went to listen to what they were talking about. I went to the back side of the ladder while they were talking in front of the ladder. However, at that time their main talk was over.
