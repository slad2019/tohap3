**A:**  I heard that <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. ཀ་ཤོད་པ] A famous Tibetan aristocrat who was involved in many important political intrigues.">Kapshöba</span> instigated the <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. ཁྱུང་རམ] A famous aristocratic lay official during the time of the 13th Dalai Lama.">Khyungram</span> trouble. Kapshöba made the Horpa [the nomads from the north] submit a petition which was endorsed by Reting. This was just a pretext. The main reason why Reting didn't like Khyungram was because Khyungram said that some are, "Not full even after eating the mountain" [Tib. རི་བོ་ཟོས་ནས་མ་འགྲངས].   

**Q:**  Who was Töpa Khembo [Tib. སྟོད་པ་མཁན་པོ]?   

**A:**  He was the pockmarked one who was from <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. སེ་ར་བྱེས] The Jey (Je) College of Sera Monastery.">Sera Jey</span> College.   

**Q:**  Wasn't there a lot of trouble when Reting Rimpoche was about to appoint the Töpa Khembo something and the Sera monks didn't accept that?   

**A:**  Yes. He was about to appoint a Töpa Khembo to a position in the <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. སེ་ར་སྨད] The Me (Mey) College in Sera Monastery">Sera Me</span> College or something [as abbot]. I am sure about that.   

**Q:**  Did you say that on the day when the <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. སྤོམ་མདའ་ཚང] A name of a Khamba trading family that became Tibetan government lay officials.">Pandatsang</span> issue was settled, the <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. དྲུང་རྩིས] The drunyichemmo and the tsipön.">drungtsi</span> entered his house?   

**A:**  Yes. It was certainly the <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. དྲུང་རྩིས] The drunyichemmo and the tsipön.">drungtsi</span>, because I saw that they were wearing their red robes [Tib. ཁ་གོན].   

**Q:**  You said that <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. སྤོམ་མདའ་ཚང] A name of a Khamba trading family that became Tibetan government lay officials.">Pandatsang</span> gave <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. ཁ་བཏགས] A Tibetan ceremonial scarf given to lamas, visitors, etc.">khata</span> scarves to the soldiers and then the soldiers went back through the <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. བར་སྐོར] The inner circumambulation road that goes around the Tsuglagang (Jokhang) Temple in Lhasa. This circular road was a main market area.">Barkor</span> Street, right?   

**A:**  Yes. It was said that the matter was settled and then the soldiers went back.   

**Q:**  It was Chöyang [Tib. ཆོས་དབྱངས] of Ling [Tib. གླིང] who first requested that the Tratsang act as the guarantor. He said that he will bring along the Tratsang, right?   

**A:**  It was not Chöyang, but the Gegen of Chöyang who was the <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. ཕྱག་མཛོད] A senior manager/treasurer of an aristocratic or monastic estate, or the senior manager/treasurer of an aristocratic family or a monastic unit. Generally chandzö handled both internal and external issues and were considered higher in power and status than nyerpa (stewards), who typically only handled the storerooms.">chandzö</span> of the Ling Labrang. At that time, Chöyang was a child.   

**Q:**  What is the name of Chöyang's Gegen?   

**A:**  He was called Simgag Gyatso [Tib. གཟིམ་འགག་རྒྱ་མཚོ] when he later became the Simgag of the Dalai Lama after he asked for leave from Ling Labrang. I don't have any idea whether he got along well with Ling Labrang. He was the brother of the <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. རྩེ་དྲུང] A monk official in the Tibetan government.">tsidrung</span> nicknamed, "Yes, you are right" Therepo [Tib. དེ་རེད་སྤོ་བོ]. The <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. ཕྱག་མཛོད] A senior manager/treasurer of an aristocratic or monastic estate, or the senior manager/treasurer of an aristocratic family or a monastic unit. Generally chandzö handled both internal and external issues and were considered higher in power and status than nyerpa (stewards), who typically only handled the storerooms.">chandzö</span> also had a sister from the same parents called Wamo Thöndrub Drolma [Tib. ཝ་མོ་དོན་གྲུབ་སྒྲོལ་མ] who lived near the meat market. He probably served as Simgag for about 5-6 years. Then he resigned.   

**Q:**  Was this during Reting or <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. སྟག་བྲག] The regent of Tibet who replaced Reting in 1941 and served until 1950 when the 14th Dalai Lama assumed power.">Taktra</span>'s time?   

**A:**  He was Simgag at the time of <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. སྟག་བྲག] The regent of Tibet who replaced Reting in 1941 and served until 1950 when the 14th Dalai Lama assumed power.">Taktra</span> also. After he resigned from being Simgag, he stayed in the monastery where he had the title of Letsenpa and he would come to the <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. བླ་སྤྱི] The highest administrative council in large monasteries, like Drepung. It consisted of the Abbots, the Tshogchen Umdze, the Shengo and the Jiso. In Drepung it also included ex-abbots.">Laji</span> meetings on the rooftop of the assembly hall. Chöyang's <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. དགེ་རྒན] 1. Teacher in a school. 2. In monastic settings it also refers to an adult monk who acted as a guardian to a younger monk. In such cases, the younger monk typically lived in the gegen&#x27;s apartment (shag). In monasteries, however, it could also mean a real teacher, or the monk who served as the guarantor for a new monk.">gegen</span> was called Thöndrub La [Tib. དོན་གྲུབ་ལགས]. He used be the Söpön of the former Ling Rimpoche and also served the present incarnation. Then when he became old and became the senior <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. ཕྱག་མཛོད] A senior manager/treasurer of an aristocratic or monastic estate, or the senior manager/treasurer of an aristocratic family or a monastic unit. Generally chandzö handled both internal and external issues and were considered higher in power and status than nyerpa (stewards), who typically only handled the storerooms.">chandzö</span>, Lungrig La [Tib. ལུང་རིག་ལགས] became the junior chandzö. There were two chandzö. Thöndrub La didn't have power because Lungrig La took the responsibilities. Later, at the time of the revolt, he was left in Tibet.   

**Q:**  You mean the <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. ཕྱག་མཛོད] A senior manager/treasurer of an aristocratic or monastic estate, or the senior manager/treasurer of an aristocratic family or a monastic unit. Generally chandzö handled both internal and external issues and were considered higher in power and status than nyerpa (stewards), who typically only handled the storerooms.">chandzö</span> with the white hair?   

**A:**  He was not that white-haired. It was more greyish hair.   

**Q:**  When you came to Drepung, who was the abbot?   

**A:**  It was at the beginning of the term of the abbot named Gowo [Tib. གོ་བོ].   

**Q:**  How did you get into <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. ཚ་བ་ཁང་ཚན] One of the main residential units (khamtsen) in Drepung Monastery.">Tsha Khamtsen</span>?   

**A:**  In the past, my maternal aunt's husband who was called Tashi Tsering was from <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. ཚ་བ་ཁང་ཚན] One of the main residential units (khamtsen) in Drepung Monastery.">Tsha Khamtsen</span>. He was close to the late Tsaja who was banished. My grandparents were living in Talungchang [Tib. སྟག་ལུང་བྱང] in Lhasa. Later our late <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. རྩེ་དྲུང] A monk official in the Tibetan government.">tsidrung</span> joined Tsha Khamtsen and became a Chöndze and then I also joined Tsha Khamtsen.   

**Q:**  So actually, you did not belong to [to the region eligible for] Tsha, right?   

**A:**  Yes.   

**Q:**  Which Khamtsen should you have belonged to?   

**A:**  Actually we were the <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. མི་སེར] A term that can mean serf/bound subject as well as citizen, depending on context. For example, the miser of a lord would connote the bound subjects of that lord, whereas the miser of Tibet would connote citizens of Tibet.">miser</span> of <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. ཡབ་གཞིས] 1. The title given to a family of a Dalai Lama. 2. When used by itself, e.g., Yabshi&#x27;s house, it refers to the family of the current Dalai Lama.">Yabshi</span> Langdön, so we should have belonged to Kongpo Khamtsen.   

**Q:**  Didn't they complain because you switched from Kongpo to Tsha?   

**A:**  I am just an ordinary person so they did not argue. If I was rich, then they would have argued. Even for young and poor incarnate lamas, nobody would argue. But when you have wealth and reputation, then everybody will fight for you. This was the normal system.   

**Q:**  How many <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. ཁང་ཚན] A monastic residential unit in which monks from specific geographic areas lived. These were corporate entities with property and internal officials. Some large khamtsen had smaller subordinate units called mi tshan. Khamtsen were part of tratsang (colleges). For example, Hamdong Khamtsen was part of Gomang College in Drepung Monastery.">khamtsen</span> were there in <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. བློ་གསལ་གླིང] One of the main colleges in Drepung Monastery.">Loseling</span>?   

**A:**  There were 23, and then later 24. Out of these, three were the bigger ones known as Chegasum [Tib. ཆེ་ཁག་གསུམ]. They were called the three Nachen.   

**Q:**  What were the privileges of the Chegasum?   

**A:**  I do not know.   

**Q:**  How many medium ones were there?   

**A:**  There were seven medium ones.   

**Q:**  Which were the seven medium ones? Wasn't Nyagre [Tib. ཉག་རེ] one?   

**A:**  Yes. Then there was <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. སྤོམ་པོ་རག] A medium size khamtsen in Loseling College in Drepung Monastery.">Bombora</span> and also probably Triu [Tib. ཏྲེཧོར], Lhopa [Tib. ལྷོ་པ] and probably Phara [Tib. ཕ་ར] were also ones. I forget the other ones. And then there were thirteen small ones.   

**A:**  What was the basis of this division into big, medium and small?   

**A:**  It was differentiated when they made the monks to do the <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. གཞོན་ཁྲལ] The work obligations all young monks have to do for the monastery (it literally means &quot;youth tax&quot;).">shöndre</span> (young monk's work). When some meetings were held, they would say that the big ones wee obliged to send so many [monks to work] and the smaller ones were obliged to send so much.   

**Q:**  Who would do this?   

**A:**  This was mainly done by the Chabril.   

**Q:**  How many Khamtsen were there in <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. སྒོ་མང] One of the large colleges in Drepung Monastery.">Gomang</span>?   

**A:**  There were sixteen and among them there were two big ones, Hamdong and Samlo [Tib. བསམ་ལྷོ]. The next ones were Gungru [Tib. གུང་རུ] and Bati [Tib. སྦྲ་སྡི]. These were the four <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. ཕྱག་སྦུག] A manager (of estates and endowments) of a monastic college or monastic khamtsen.">chabu</span> of Gomang. Hamdong, Samlo and Gungru were called "seniors" (Tib. དྲེཔ [Tib. བགྲེས་པ]) not because they had seniority on the monk's enrollment list, but because they were the Chabu of Gomang.   

**Q:**  Did they enjoy a government rank like the <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. ཞལ་ངོ] 1. A junior officer in the traditional Tibetan Army in charge of a unit (platoon) of 25 soldiers (same as dingpön). 2. The two head disciplinary officials for all of Drepung Monastery and for the Mönlam Prayer Festival.">Shengo</span>?   

**A:**  No. The drepa were all Chabu. The Khamtsen <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. དགེ་རྒན] 1. Teacher in a school. 2. In monastic settings it also refers to an adult monk who acted as a guardian to a younger monk. In such cases, the younger monk typically lived in the gegen&#x27;s apartment (shag). In monasteries, however, it could also mean a real teacher, or the monk who served as the guarantor for a new monk.">gegen</span> of Hamdong and Samlo enjoyed a rank and had a funny dress and they wore some kind of padding (Tib. ཐོཔོག [Tib. མཐོ་བོག]) on their shoulders. On top of that, they wore a satin garment [Tib. གོས་སྟོད] like the <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. རྩེ་དྲུང] A monk official in the Tibetan government.">tsidrung</span> did. The <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. བླ་སྤྱི] The highest administrative council in large monasteries, like Drepung. It consisted of the Abbots, the Tshogchen Umdze, the Shengo and the Jiso. In Drepung it also included ex-abbots.">Laji</span> belonged to the bigger and medium khamtsen.   

**Q:**  Among the <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. བླ་སྤྱི] The highest administrative council in large monasteries, like Drepung. It consisted of the Abbots, the Tshogchen Umdze, the Shengo and the Jiso. In Drepung it also included ex-abbots.">Laji</span>, there were big, medium and the small ones, right?   

**A:**  Yes.   

**Q:**  How many Khamtsen did <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. སྒོ་མང] One of the large colleges in Drepung Monastery.">Gomang</span> have?   

**A:**  They had 16, and <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. སྡེ་ཡངས] One of the colleges in Drepung Monastery.">Deyang</span> had no <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. ཁང་ཚན] A monastic residential unit in which monks from specific geographic areas lived. These were corporate entities with property and internal officials. Some large khamtsen had smaller subordinate units called mi tshan. Khamtsen were part of tratsang (colleges). For example, Hamdong Khamtsen was part of Gomang College in Drepung Monastery.">khamtsen</span> at all and had maybe only 500 or less monks. The fourth [college] was Ngagpa College and they had fewer monks than Deyang.   

**Q:**  Gyepa [Tib. རྒྱས་པ] and Shagor [Tib. ཤག་སྒོར] didn't have many monks, right?   

**A:**  Gyepa and Shagor were part of Loseling. Nyalingtsulsum [Tib. ཉག་གླིང་ཚུལ་གསུམ] -- Nyango [Tib. ཉག་འགོ], Ling [Tib. གླིང] and Tsümey [Tib. ཚུལ་སྨད] belonged to Shagor.   

**Q:**  Which were the ones that belonged to Gyepa?   

**A:**  Gyepa was a separate one.   

**Q:**  What about Dingga [Tib. ལྡིང་ཁ]?   

**A:**  Dingga belongs to Shagor.   

**Q:**  How many monks did they have in Tsükhang?   

**A:**  The three, Nyalingtsulsum, together may not have had more than 500 monks. As a part of <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. སྒོ་མང] One of the large colleges in Drepung Monastery.">Gomang</span>, there was Dülwa.   

**Q:**  How many monks did Dülwa have?   

**Q:**  They had only Gadong [Tib. དགའ་གདོང] Mitsen. They had Hamdong and Samlo also.   

**Q:**  Which was the highest decision making body? Was it the Drepung <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. བླ་སྤྱི] The highest administrative council in large monasteries, like Drepung. It consisted of the Abbots, the Tshogchen Umdze, the Shengo and the Jiso. In Drepung it also included ex-abbots.">Laji</span>?   

**A:**  Yes. Regarding the laws of the monks and punishments, the <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. བླ་སྤྱི] The highest administrative council in large monasteries, like Drepung. It consisted of the Abbots, the Tshogchen Umdze, the Shengo and the Jiso. In Drepung it also included ex-abbots.">Laji</span> had no business at all. That responsibility rested with the <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. ཞལ་ངོ] 1. A junior officer in the traditional Tibetan Army in charge of a unit (platoon) of 25 soldiers (same as dingpön). 2. The two head disciplinary officials for all of Drepung Monastery and for the Mönlam Prayer Festival.">Shengo</span> only.   

**Q:**  Who were the <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. བླ་སྤྱི] The highest administrative council in large monasteries, like Drepung. It consisted of the Abbots, the Tshogchen Umdze, the Shengo and the Jiso. In Drepung it also included ex-abbots.">Laji</span> members?   

**A:**  The senior most abbot, the Khembo Tripa, [Tib. མཁན་པོ་ཁྲི་པ] was the chairman, and he was the most important of the <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. བླ་སྤྱི] The highest administrative council in large monasteries, like Drepung. It consisted of the Abbots, the Tshogchen Umdze, the Shengo and the Jiso. In Drepung it also included ex-abbots.">Laji</span> members. Then all the abbots and ex-abbots of Drepung were there. They were the most powerful ones. It was different [in Drepung] than in Sera and Ganden where only the actual abbots were involved, not the ex-abbots. Then there were the two <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. ཞལ་ངོ] 1. A junior officer in the traditional Tibetan Army in charge of a unit (platoon) of 25 soldiers (same as dingpön). 2. The two head disciplinary officials for all of Drepung Monastery and for the Mönlam Prayer Festival.">Shengo</span> and the Tsogchen Chemmo [Tib. ཚོགས་ཆེན་ཆེན་མོ་བ] [the umdze]. The two Jiso and the Phodrang Depa [Tib. ཕོ་བྲང་སྡེ་པ] were also there. This was the big Laji (Tib. ལཇི་ཆེག [ཆེ་ཁག]). They were the senior members of the Laji. The middle level, between the senior and the juniors, were the Khamtsen <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. དགེ་རྒན] 1. Teacher in a school. 2. In monastic settings it also refers to an adult monk who acted as a guardian to a younger monk. In such cases, the younger monk typically lived in the gegen&#x27;s apartment (shag). In monasteries, however, it could also mean a real teacher, or the monk who served as the guarantor for a new monk.">gegen</span> of Hamdong and Samlo khamtsen. Then there was a man called the Yarne Depa [Tib. དབྱར་གནས་སྡེ་པ] who would wear a satin jacket [Tib. གོས་སྟོད]. He was the person in charge of the summer retreats. One Parkhang Depa [Tib. པར་ཁང་སྡེ་པ] from <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. བློ་གསལ་གླིང] One of the main colleges in Drepung Monastery.">Loseling</span> and one from <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. སྒོ་མང] One of the large colleges in Drepung Monastery.">Gomang</span> were the ones in charge of printing. There was a Tsomchen Depa [Tib. ཚོམ་ཆེན་སྡེ་པ] and then there was the Chatsü Depa [Tib. བྱ་ཚུལ་སྡེ་པ]. These were middle level Laji. The junior Laji, the chungga [Tib. ཆུང་ཁག], were the Nangma [Tib. ནང་མ], the Chabril, the Lama Migtsema [Tib. བླ་མ་དམིགས་རྩེ་མ] and the two Jama (tea makers) (Tib. ཇ་མ) of the assembly.   

**Q:**  Who would attend the meetings?   

**A:**  Only the big ones would attend the meetings. The junior and middle <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. བླ་སྤྱི] The highest administrative council in large monasteries, like Drepung. It consisted of the Abbots, the Tshogchen Umdze, the Shengo and the Jiso. In Drepung it also included ex-abbots.">Laji</span> had no business to attend the meetings except when a Tsogchen Trülku was joining the monastery or passing their exams during the <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. གཏོང་སྒོ] A monastic obligation to provide the food and other necessary items served at a monastic prayer assembly meeting or some other rite; this was often a required obligation for monastic officials at the end of their term of office.">tonggo</span>, etc. They gave gifts and at that time the Laji could collect income. So they had the titles, but they had no work. When you took the Geshe exam, you gave gifts to the senior, junior and the middle Laji, but you may not have known it.   

**Q:**  All the respective abbots and candidates are selected by the monasteries themselves and then approved by the government, right? And their term is 6 years, right?   

**A:**  Yes.   

**Q:**  What about the chairman of the abbots?   

**A:**  The chairman of abbot, the Khembo Tripa [Tib. མཁན་པོ་ཁྲི་པ] was not appointed by the government. It went to the senior-most abbot and it had no time limit. The abbots served for six years and then they were changed. The Khembo Tripa has no time limit. I remember that when Jungnela [Tib. འབྱུང་གནས] was the Khembo Tripa, there was an old one sitting above him. He said his name was Khembo Lobsang Tashi [Tib. བློ་བཟང་བཀྲ་ཤིས] and he had a goiter. He was the chairman, but due to his ill health he could not carry out the work so he resigned and they excused him and the next one was Jungnela.   

**Q:**  To whom did he have to ask about the resignation?   

**A:**  He had to ask the <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. བླ་སྤྱི] The highest administrative council in large monasteries, like Drepung. It consisted of the Abbots, the Tshogchen Umdze, the Shengo and the Jiso. In Drepung it also included ex-abbots.">Laji</span> to resign, not the government.   

**Q:**  The Khembo Tripa was appointed by the <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. བླ་སྤྱི] The highest administrative council in large monasteries, like Drepung. It consisted of the Abbots, the Tshogchen Umdze, the Shengo and the Jiso. In Drepung it also included ex-abbots.">Laji</span>, right?   

**A:**  Yes. The next was Gyepa Khembo and then the Shagor Khembo [Tib. ཤག་སྒོར་མཁན་པོ] who looked like a nun. When his turn came, he could not manage, so he resigned.   

**Q:**  Why?   

**A:**  Because he could not handle the responsibilities of a Laji. He could not do it.   

**Q:**  What is the power of the <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. བླ་སྤྱི] The highest administrative council in large monasteries, like Drepung. It consisted of the Abbots, the Tshogchen Umdze, the Shengo and the Jiso. In Drepung it also included ex-abbots.">Laji</span>?   

**A:**  Any disputes between the Tratsang or among the Khamtsen, etc. anything within the jurisdiction of Drepung could be settled by the Laji.   

**Q:**  What power did the <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. བླ་སྤྱི] The highest administrative council in large monasteries, like Drepung. It consisted of the Abbots, the Tshogchen Umdze, the Shengo and the Jiso. In Drepung it also included ex-abbots.">Laji</span> have and what income did they have?   

**A:**  The <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. བླ་སྤྱི] The highest administrative council in large monasteries, like Drepung. It consisted of the Abbots, the Tshogchen Umdze, the Shengo and the Jiso. In Drepung it also included ex-abbots.">Laji</span> was the head of all the Tratsang and they would settle matters regarding the Tratsang.   

**Q:**  The disputes between the Tratsang were also settled by the <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. བླ་སྤྱི] The highest administrative council in large monasteries, like Drepung. It consisted of the Abbots, the Tshogchen Umdze, the Shengo and the Jiso. In Drepung it also included ex-abbots.">Laji</span>, right?   

**A:**  Yes. They just advised them. They didn't have any punishments they could give. The <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. བླ་སྤྱི] The highest administrative council in large monasteries, like Drepung. It consisted of the Abbots, the Tshogchen Umdze, the Shengo and the Jiso. In Drepung it also included ex-abbots.">Laji</span> would also settle matters regarding which Khamtsen a person <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. ཞོ] A unit in the traditional Tibetan currency system. 10 sho equaled to 1 sang and 10 karma equaled one sho.">sho</span>uld belong to. The Drepung Laji would get the "general gifts" [Tib. སྤྱི་འབུལ] during the Mönlam Prayer Festival. Every person who gave alms at the Mönlam gave a rice load [rice packed in dried skin] that was about 40 kg [to the Laji]. This rice load was given by the <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. བླ་ཕྱག] 1. The abbreviation of bla brang phyag mdzod, a major treasury/supply office that was located on the second floor of the Tsuglagang Temple and collected taxes annually from various parts of Tibet. 2. A monastic official/manager who worked for the Labrang of the abbots or incarnate lamas. For example, in Loseling College in Drepung, the Laja worked for the abbot who appointed him.">Laja</span> Treasury Office. During the Mönlam Festival, at each prayer assembly, there could be 50 to 60 alms-givers and every day there were two assemblies, so hundreds of rice loads would come to the Laji. Along with the rice loads, one long <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. ཁ་བཏགས] A Tibetan ceremonial scarf given to lamas, visitors, etc.">khata</span> scarf called <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. ནང་མཛོད] A special high quality Khata scarf">nangdzö</span> and one <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. ཏམ་ཀ] A unit in the traditional Tibetan currency system that was equal to 4 sang.">tranka</span> was also given to the Laji. The list was made by a person called the Labrang Chandzö and one of the Chagdrung of the Laja would also note these down and later they collected them together and brought them to the monastery. Also, there was a request list for prayers [Tib. གྱབཐོ] at Drepung accompanied by a scarf and some money. This khata went to the senior <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. ཞལ་ངོ] 1.

A person&#x27;s name.">karma</span> for the prayer request, the Shengo had to pay double that to the Laji. Every night the Labrang Chandzö came to the Shengo's office to collect this. Every time if it was written 15 sho in the prayer request list, then the Shengo had to pay 30 sho, i.e., double the amount. If there was any extra money that was not written in the prayer request, earlier this money went to the senior Shengo, but later they changed this and divided the money. During Jungne La's time, it was very good. He kept all the rice and sold it and kept the money separately. He would announce suddenly that tomorrow there will be a distribution of money and he distributed it to the monks. He gave extra money if the incarnate lamas came personally, and otherwise he gave very little even to the Shengo. When people give endowments to the general prayer assembly, this money went to the Laji. If the Laji couldn't handle the money because there was too much money, it would be given it to the Jiso.   

**Q:**  Was this a practice even before Jungnela?   

**A:**  They were supposed to do this, but they did it only once in a while and then that was it. The <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. བླ་སྤྱི] The highest administrative council in large monasteries, like Drepung. It consisted of the Abbots, the Tshogchen Umdze, the Shengo and the Jiso. In Drepung it also included ex-abbots.">Laji</span> used to loan money to the Khamtsen and the Mitsen in the monastery and collect the interest. They would fix the date to collect the interest and give notice at least a month before the interest collection was due. That day would start early in the morning and they would read the list and then you just say I am here and give the interest. If you do not pay the interest, then they will scold you. The interest was collected without fail and on time during Jungne la's period, but before that, it was not done so well. Besides this, the Laji had no income.   

**Q:**  Where did the <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. བླ་སྤྱི] The highest administrative council in large monasteries, like Drepung. It consisted of the Abbots, the Tshogchen Umdze, the Shengo and the Jiso. In Drepung it also included ex-abbots.">Laji</span> meet?   

**A:**  They always met on the top of the assembly hall where there was a big room.   

**Q:**  How was the seating arrangement made? I have not seen it. How did they sit?   

**A:**  The abbot and the ex-abbots had the cushions called markyong [Tib. དམར་རྐྱོང] which were thick with red cushions made from woolen material.   

**Q:**  What sort of seat did the Khembo Tripa have?   

**A:**  He had an extra seat (cushion) and it was higher, like 4 inches higher than the rest of them. There was a thick stuffed cushion [Tib. འབོལ་གདན] covered with cotton cushion material called Sangkha [Tib. བཟང་ཁ] for the Khembo Tripa. Sangkha was made from cotton, but the design was like the multicolored brocade cushion called gökha [Tib. གོས་ཁ].   

**Q:**  What kind of tables did they have?   

**Q:**  They used the table called bujog [Tib. བུ་ལྕོགས] which had legs but it was a standing table. Below the abbot there were the <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. ཞལ་ངོ] 1.

**Q:**  They all had equal sized cushions, right?   

**A:**  They had equal seats. If they could not fit in one place then they will start sitting on the other side.   

**Q:**  Would they serve tea when they assembled there?   

**A:**  They served tea.   

**Q:**  Would they serve <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. སྤགས] A staple Tibetan dish of tsampa mixed with tea and kneaded into balls of dough-like consistency.">pag</span>?   

**A:**  No. First they started talking, and then after awhile, they served pag.   

**Q:**  The expenses for this were paid by the <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. བླ་སྤྱི] The highest administrative council in large monasteries, like Drepung. It consisted of the Abbots, the Tshogchen Umdze, the Shengo and the Jiso. In Drepung it also included ex-abbots.">Laji</span>, right?

**Q:**  Yes. What was the responsibility of the Labrang Chandzö?   

**A:**  He was the one who did the miscellaneous work going hither and thither [Tib. བཏང་ཐུང་རྒྱུགས] and asking the Khembo Tripa what should be done. And he would also deliver messages.   

**Q:**  Where would the Labrang Chandzö stay?   

**A:**  He would stay in his own apartment.   

**Q:**  Where would this person come from? Did he come from the Tratsang by turns?   

**A:**  He came from <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. སྒོ་མང] One of the large colleges in Drepung Monastery.">Gomang</span> and also from Loseling.   

**Q:**  Would they serve by turns?   

**A:**  No. This was decided by the Khembo Tripa.   

**Q:**  So he was appointed, right?   

**A:**  Yes.   

**Q:**  Was he appointed once every year? Was there any term for that?   

**A:**  No. It depended on whether he got along well with the Khembo Tripa.   

**Q:**  When the Khembo Tripa was changed, would the Labrang Chandzö also change.   

**A:**  If he did well, he would still remain there. There was no term. When he didn't get along well, he would resign when he thought it was not going to be good.   

**Q:**  This was not the Lama Migtsema, right?   

**A:**  Yes, it was not. The Lama Migtsema came from Gomang.   

**Q:**  What was the job of the Lama Migtsema?   

**A:**  His job was to lead the prayer called Migtsema.

He would have to visualize it.   

**Q:**  What kind of visualization?   

**A:**  I am not sure what visualization. He would do the visualization and when he finished reciting it, he would cough three or four times [Tib. གློ་བསངས་རྒྱག] to give a signal.   

**Q:**  Would he cough aloud?   

**A:**  He would cough so loud that the whole monastery could hear. Then he would hit the victory banner [Tib. རྒྱལ་མཚན] with his rosary several times which would make the sound, "hreng hreng" which was also heard in the monastery. This was to alert the monks who were in their prayer session [Tib. ཐུན] to tell them that the person shouting <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. ཆུ་སྐད] The stylized yelling of young monks from a monastic roof that announces to the monastic community that there will be a distribution of alms in the prayer assembly that day.">chuke</span> is coming.   

**Q:**  When they shouted the <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. ཆུ་སྐད] The stylized yelling of young monks from a monastic roof that announces to the monastic community that there will be a distribution of alms in the prayer assembly that day.">chuke</span>, would they first face the east?   

**A:**  Yes. Then they shouted it in all directions saying "ah ah ha " for a long time.   

**Q:**  The Lama Migtsema's job was to recite the Migtsema, right?   

**A:**  He also had to deliver messages for the assembly. The Lama Migtsema should be a <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. དགེ་ཤེས] An advanced degree earned by scholar monks.">geshe</span> from Gomang.

**Q:**  Would the Lama Migtsema have to stand when they serve the tea at the prayer assembly?   

**A:**  He would stand in the kitchen and when they finished serving tea to the monks in the front line, he would shout, "the front line is served" [Tib. གདོང་གྲལ་ཁེབས་སོང].   

**Q:**  The Lama Migtsema was appointed when each new abbot started his term, right?   

**A:**  Yes.   

**Q:**  What kind of privileges did the Lama Migtsema have? Did he get extra shares of alms?   

**A:**  Yes, he got three extra shares at the Mönlam. The Lama Migtsema had it difficult at the Mönlam because he had to stay the whole night in the <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. ཞལ་ངོ] 1.

In the morning, two people who were on turn to fetch water [Tib. ཆུ་རེས] and two other people would come and the Lama Migtsema also have to go to the prayer assembly. [from here there is a section where the recording is unclear] And then he had to look at his watch and wake up the two Shengo. When the Shengo went down to the stone steps, the Geyog had already gotten up. Then the Thabyog would open the door of the kitchen.

**A:**  Yes.   

**Q:**  The Dalai Lama was not allowed to approve a person who was not among the candidates, right?   

**A:**  The Dalai Lama wouldn't do that.   

**Q:**  It happened like that. For example, the abbot of <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. སེ་ར་བྱེས] The Jey (Je) College of Sera Monastery.">Sera Jey</span> was approved although he was not among the candidates.

**A:**  No. They regarded the level or position they had as a monastic official [Tib. thön].   

**Q:**  If both were Chatsül, what would they do?   

**A:**  Then it went according to the monk's seniority. If both were ordinary monks, it went according to the who took the <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. དགེ་སློང] A monk who has taken the full set of vows.">gelong</span> vow first. If the one from <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. བློ་གསལ་གླིང] One of the main colleges in Drepung Monastery.">Loseling</span> was a Getsül and the one from <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. སྒོ་མང] One of the large colleges in Drepung Monastery.">Gomang</span> was a Nyertsang, then Loseling one became the senior.
