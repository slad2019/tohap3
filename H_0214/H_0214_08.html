However, if the Gomang was a Nyertsang and the Loseling was a geg&#xF6;, the Loseling would become the senior. If both of them were ordinary monks, it went according to their seniority.

Then the old shengo would sit at the head and they would put a plate full of wheat.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  Who would bring this wheat?   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  This will be prepared by the new shengo. There will be somebody who will explain how to do that.

For example, Hamdong Khamtsen was part of Gomang College in Drepung Monastery.">khamtsen</a>, but I took off the roof and renovated it. Everyone was amazed at the way I renovated it. I had 8 long pillars in the veranda where I used a canopy. It was really nice with good privacy because I made an entrance door on the roof, so when I entered this door, all the spaces were mine. I was on the third floor and in the other lower floors there were about 35-36 monk&apos;s shag. We had a main gate which was closed at night. At night the monks are not allowed to go outside. However, some young monks would urinate on the door hinge so that it would not make the sound &quot;tsir&quot; and then they went out.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  Could you own the house yourself?   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  Yes. I got the permanent right of ownership. I had 4 gidru. I didn&apos;t need to pay rent and when I renovated it, the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. &#xF41;&#xF44;&#xF0B;&#xF5A;&#xF53;] A monastic residential unit in which monks from specific geographic areas lived.

<p><strong>Q:</strong>  Other than Losar, were there any occasions for the monks to enjoy themselves?   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  No.   </p>

It was a time when Tibetan operas were performed.">Shot&#xF6;n</a>, the opera festival was for 2 days, right?   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  Yes. At that time, my <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. 1. &#xF64;&#xF42;, 2. &#xF5E;&#xF42;] 1. The apartment/room of a monk. 2. The butter fat that coagulates on the top of butter-tea when the tea is left to sit for some time. If the tea had been made with a lot of butter, this layer could be thick enough to scoop off and save to later sell or eat separately. The senior monks are usually served tea with a lot of shag.">shag</a> will be packed with people. And there was the bathing picnic (Tib. &#xF46;&#xF56;&#xF64;&#xF74;&#xF42; [&#xF46;&#xF56;&#xF0B;&#xF5E;&#xF74;&#xF42;&#xF66;]) which was held in the orchard (Tib. linga [gling ga].   </p>

<p><strong>Q:</strong>  It was a pity that Tengyeling was no more [it was torn down by the government]. I heard that it was very large. We can see the remaining walls.   </p>
