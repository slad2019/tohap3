<p><strong>Q:</strong>  Then they would weigh the butter in bags made of skin, right?   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  Yes. And then the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. &#xF62;&#xF92;&#xF53;&#xF0B;&#xF56;&#xF7C;] A village headman. Such headmen were responsible for organizing the different households to pay the village&apos;s taxes in-kind and labor.

For example, a field said to be 10 khe in size meant that 10 khe of seed could be sown on that field.">khe</a>, they had to bring about 18 khe of butter. And the ones who had to bring about 3 khe, they had to bring about 5 khe of butter.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  It was almost double, right?   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  Yes. Usually they [the person who weighed the butter] would get about 3 skin loads of the butter [as a gift], but since then [Urgyen made a new rule], they didn&apos;t get any [extra for themselves]. They did the packing of butter in skin bags and when they didn&apos;t have enough butter [to meet the tax], they would give me some gift (Tib. &#xF47;&#xF7A;&#xF64;&#xF74; [&#xF58;&#xF47;&#xF63;&#xF0B;&#xF5E;&#xF74;]) and ask to be allowed to have a deficit (Tib. &#xF46;&#xF7A; [&#xF46;&#xF51;]) that year. Before that, some people had left [not repaid] the deficit payment for 6 years and some even left it for 12 years, so I told them that they had to pay as much they could. They said they will try their best and on the next evening they came and brought a <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. &#xF41;&#xF0B;&#xF56;&#xF4F;&#xF42;&#xF66;] A Tibetan ceremonial scarf given to lamas, visitors, etc.">khata</a> scarf and said, &quot;Now we have discussed this and since the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. &#xF51;&#xF54;&#xF7C;&#xF53;&#xF0B;&#xF54;&#xF7C;, &#xF58;&#xF44;&#xF60;&#xF0B;&#xF56;&#xF51;&#xF42;] 1.

Chief of an area.">lord</a> (p&#xF6;n) is treating us so nicely, it will not be okay if we don&apos;t pay the deficit.&quot; Some cleared all the deficits they had, and some paid as much they could.

<p><strong>A:</strong>  There were almost 100. About 80-90 households.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  How many days would it take to weigh the butter?   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  It took about 28 days.

<p><strong>Q:</strong>  What was that for?   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  It was for making tea. They also brought meat and milk was more abundant than water.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  How much meat did they bring?   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  They brought a mutton carcass once every two or three days. In the beginning, they brought tea leaves and rice.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  What kind of tea leaves did they bring?   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  They brought brick tea (Tib. &#xF56;&#xF42;&#xF46;&#xF74;&#xF44; [&#xF66;&#xFA6;&#xF42;&#xF0B;&#xF46;&#xF74;&#xF44;]) and tea balls (Tib. &#xF46;&#xF62;&#xF72;&#xF63; [&#xF47;&#xF0B;&#xF62;&#xF72;&#xF63;]). They also brought black fungus [Tib. &#xF58;&#xF7C;&#xF42;&#xF0B;&#xF62;&#xF7C;] and vermicelli.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  And of course they brought mushrooms, right?   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  Yes. They said they had to bring these whether I stayed there or not. And they also brought the butter-cheese cakes [Tib. th&#xFC;]. They ate sweet potatoes with melted butter and they would also give me my share. Before concluding the tax collection, I told them that you <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. &#xF58;&#xF72;&#xF0B;&#xF66;&#xF7A;&#xF62;] A term that can mean serf/bound subject as well as citizen, depending on context.

It consisted of the Abbots, the Tshogchen Umdze, the Shengo and the Jiso. In Drepung it also included ex-abbots.">Laji</a> and show the documents [regarding the exemptions] to the Laji and ask for their endorsement (Tib. &#xF42;&#xF7C;&#xF58;&#xF46;&#xF7A;&#xF53; [&#xF60;&#xF42;&#xF7C;&#xF0B;&#xF58;&#xF46;&#xF53;]). Otherwise, I said, in the future I will not come and the new person will not honor my documents. Then one person from each group came with me and they stayed in [Drepung] monastery. Their food was supplied and they went to Lhasa from the monastery for pilgrimage. Then the Laji told me, &quot;You have done everything very well and we will also give you the endorsement in a document.&quot; The Laji also told them that they had to get an endorsement from the Kashag which will make your document very firm [Tib. &#xF56;&#xF59;&#xF53;&#xF0B;&#xF54;&#xF7C;]. However, they said, &quot;We don&apos;t dare to ask the Kashag for an endorsement.&quot; Then the Laji told them, &quot;You are indeed damn fool nomads! Don&apos;t talk foolishly [Tib. &#xF63;&#xF90;&#xF74;&#xF42;&#xF66;&#xF0B;&#xF54;&#xF60;&#xF72;&#xF0B;&#xF66;&#xF90;&#xF51;&#xF0B;&#xF46;&#xF0B;&#xF58;&#xF0B;&#xF64;&#xF7C;&#xF51;&#xF0D; &#xF66;&#xF90;&#xFB1;&#xF42;&#xF0B;&#xF63;&#xF90;&#xF74;&#xF42;&#xF66;&#xF0B;&#xF60;&#xF56;&#xFB2;&#xF7C;&#xF42;&#xF0B;&#xF54;&#xF0B;&#xF62;&#xF44;&#xF0B;&#xF62;&#xF7A;&#xF51;]. You don&apos;t need to ask the Kashag, we will ask for you.&quot; Then they said, &quot;Thank you so much.&quot; After that, the Laji went to the Kashag and we got the endorsement from the Kashag on that very day.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  The Kashag usually would grant this kind of endorsement [document].   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  They made a cover for it and the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. &#xF56;&#xFB3;&#xF0B;&#xF66;&#xFA4;&#xFB1;&#xF72;] The highest administrative council in large monasteries, like Drepung. It consisted of the Abbots, the Tshogchen Umdze, the Shengo and the Jiso. In Drepung it also included ex-abbots.">Laji</a> also put its seal on it and they returned. Before they left, they came to my <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. 1. &#xF64;&#xF42;, 2. &#xF5E;&#xF42;] 1. The apartment/room of a monk. 2. The butter fat that coagulates on the top of butter-tea when the tea is left to sit for some time. If the tea had been made with a lot of butter, this layer could be thick enough to scoop off and save to later sell or eat separately. The senior monks are usually served tea with a lot of shag.">shag</a> and gave me some of their leftover butter and cheese, and they touched their foreheads to mine and said, &quot;We are very grateful to you.&quot; After that, they would come to me every year.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  Wouldn&apos;t the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. &#xF56;&#xFB3;&#xF0B;&#xF66;&#xFA4;&#xFB1;&#xF72;] The highest administrative council in large monasteries, like Drepung. It consisted of the Abbots, the Tshogchen Umdze, the Shengo and the Jiso. In Drepung it also included ex-abbots.">Laji</a> and the people going there give something to the nomads?   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  There was a custom to give them things like tea bricks, dyes from India (Tib. gyats&#xF6; [&#xF62;&#xF92;&#xFB1;&#xF0B;&#xF5A;&#xF7C;&#xF66;]), brown sugar, etc. which were written (specified) in a document. They would come to get them. There were about 30 households and they also offered something to us. It was up to the nomads whether they wanted to give some additional things to the person who came there. I and my servants also got a good amount of additional gifts.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  Actually, they didn&apos;t suffer a loss, right?   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  Yes.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  How many servants did you have?   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  I had three. I couldn&apos;t eat much of the butter, meat and yogurt.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  You were grateful to them, right?   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  Yes. Later, they [miser] also requested to have me sent again, but my term had ended.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  What did you do after that?   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  Then I went to Gadong [Tib. &#xF51;&#xF42;&#xF60;&#xF0B;&#xF42;&#xF51;&#xF7C;&#xF44;][monastery] in Penam [Tib. &#xF54;&#xF0B;&#xF66;&#xFA3;&#xF58;] county. At the end of the 8th lunar month, I came back to the monastery (Drepung) after almost a year [spent collecting the taxes], and then I was told to go to <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. &#xF42;&#xF59;&#xF44;] One of the major sub-areas of Tibet that is located in southwest Tibet. Its main city is Shigatse.">Tsang</a> [Penam dzong]. I stayed there also for 4 years.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  Tell me in detail about Gadong monastery.   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  It was probably decided by my <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. &#xF66;&#xF90;&#xF62;&#xF0B;&#xF58;] 1. The smallest currency unit (a copper coin) in the traditional Tibetan currency system. Ten karma equaled 1 sho. 2. A work point in post-1959 Tibet. 3. A person&apos;s name.">karma</a> [Tib. &#xF63;&#xF66;] (to be sent there).   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  What did you do in Gadong? Were you the representative?   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  I was the person in charge of the abbot&apos;s <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. &#xF56;&#xFB3;&#xF0B;&#xF56;&#xFB2;&#xF44;] 1. The property/wealth owning corporate entity of an incarnate lama. 2.

<p><strong>Q:</strong>  There was a separate abbot, right?   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  Yes. I was the person in charge of the labrang. The Tratsang was separate. I was the one in charge and there were two estates, an upper and a lower one. I had to give a lot of tonggo. I was the one in charge of all the income and all the tonggo. If the Geg&#xF6; [of the Tratsang] couldn&apos;t apply the law (Tib. trimn&#xF6;n [&#xF41;&#xFB2;&#xF72;&#xF58;&#xF66;&#xF0B;&#xF42;&#xF53;&#xF7C;&#xF53;]), he would tell me and I would call the monks and apply the law. The Nyertsang would apply the law to the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. &#xF58;&#xF72;&#xF0B;&#xF66;&#xF7A;&#xF62;] A term that can mean serf/bound subject as well as citizen, depending on context.

Actually, I was the person in charge of both the monks and the laymen in Gadong. When there was something important, I would attend the Tratsang Tsondu (assembly). They would come to ask me if there were important things to settle and I would discuss it with them.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  The <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. &#xF56;&#xFB3;&#xF0B;&#xF56;&#xFB2;&#xF44;] 1. The property/wealth owning corporate entity of an incarnate lama. 2. The property/wealth owning corporate entity of the Panchen Lama.">labrang</a> was separate [from the monastery (Tratsang)], right?   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  Yes.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  How about the abbot?   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  From the beginning, the abbot was a lama from Gadong Tratsang.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  He had been doing that permanently, right?   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  Yes. They would serve him food and things regularly. The abbot never meddled in things other than religious matters like the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. &#xF51;&#xF42;&#xF7A;&#xF0B;&#xF66;&#xFB3;&#xF7C;&#xF44;] A monk who has taken the full set of vows.">gelong</a>&apos;s confessional assembly [Tib. &#xF66;&#xF7C;&#xF47;&#xF7C;&#xF44;]. In the second year, I came to Lhasa at the end of 3rd lunar month. I heard from conversations that in the past Gadong had had a kind of dance group (Tib. &#xF4F;&#xFB2;&#xF7C;&#xF54; [&#xF56;&#xFB2;&#xF7C;&#xF0B;&#xF54;]) the practice of which had been lost about 60 years earlier. Only some old households, about 5 people, knew the dance. Most of the people [who knew] it had died. The oldest person alive was called Kyentsel Lhagpa Th&#xF6;ndrup [Tib. &#xF66;&#xF90;&#xFB1;&#xF7A;&#xF51;&#xF0B;&#xF5A;&#xF63;&#xF0B;&#xF63;&#xFB7;&#xF42;&#xF0B;&#xF54;&#xF0B;&#xF51;&#xF7C;&#xF53;&#xF0B;&#xF42;&#xFB2;&#xF74;&#xF56;]. I said if I don&apos;t do something about this, one day if it comes out from the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. &#xF62;&#xFAB;&#xF7C;&#xF44;] A district in the traditional Tibetan governmental structure. This large administrative unit was headed by one or two district heads (tib. dzongp&#xF6;n [&#xF62;&#xFAB;&#xF7C;&#xF44;&#xF0B;&#xF51;&#xF54;&#xF7C;&#xF53;]) appointed by the Tibetan government. Typically there was one lay official and one monk official who were jointly sent from Lhasa for three year terms. They were responsible for collecting taxes and adjudicating disputes in their district. These dzong were equivalent to counties (ch. &#x53BF;) in the current Chinese system of administration.">dzong</a>&apos;s documents about doing this, that will be too bad [because no one knew it], so one day I called this person. He was afraid of what would happen to him and he was even taking out a <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. &#xF41;&#xF0B;&#xF56;&#xF4F;&#xF42;&#xF66;] A Tibetan ceremonial scarf given to lamas, visitors, etc.">khata</a> scarf to give me. I told him, &quot;You don&apos;t need to take out the khata. Just sit down on this round cushion. I have something to tell you.&quot; He said, &quot;Okay, I will tell you whatever I know.&quot; Then I asked him, &quot;Was there a kind of dance group here in the past?&quot; Then he told me a lot about the dance.&quot; At that time, I was about 20-30 years old.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  The old man must have been in his 70s, right?   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  Yes. He said he was 68 years old and all the other people had died and nobody was alive except him. Then I asked him, &quot;Can you teach us the dance?&quot; He said, &quot;I can&apos;t dance because my limbs are not well, but I can verbally teach it.&quot; Then I talked with the Tratsang and the Nyertsang about [starting] the dance and they said that it would be good and then I called all the people in that area and made a list of the people.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  When you called the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. &#xF58;&#xF72;&#xF0B;&#xF66;&#xF7A;&#xF62;] A term that can mean serf/bound subject as well as citizen, depending on context.

<p><strong>A:</strong>  Yes. There were about 100 households.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  Did one person come from each of the households?   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  Some fathers and some mothers came from each household. The various <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. &#xF62;&#xF92;&#xF53;&#xF0B;&#xF56;&#xF7C;] A village headman. Such headmen were responsible for organizing the different households to pay the village&apos;s taxes in-kind and labor.

There were also paper currency notes of 7-sang, 25-sang, and 10-sang denominations.">sang</a> called them. Then I told them, &quot;It will not be okay if we don&apos;t set up the dance group because the Dalai Lama is holding his enthronement ceremony (Tib. &#xF66;&#xF7A;&#xF4F;&#xFB2;&#xF72;&#xF0B;&#xF44;&#xF66;&#xF6; [&#xF42;&#xF66;&#xF7A;&#xF62;&#xF0B;&#xF41;&#xFB2;&#xF72;&#xF0B;&#xF58;&#xF44;&#xF60;&#xF0B;&#xF42;&#xF66;&#xF7C;&#xF63;]). Although there is no custom that the Dalai Lama would come to <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. &#xF42;&#xF59;&#xF44;] One of the major sub-areas of Tibet that is located in southwest Tibet.

In Tibet, the normal custom was the opposite, i.e., women moved to the households of their husband at marriage.">magpa</a> to practice the dance. As for the expenses, the Tratsang will take care of it. Gadong monastery held <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. &#xF5A;&#xF7C;&#xF42;&#xF66;] 1. A prayer assembly meeting in monasteries when all the monks come to an assembly hall and chant prayers together. 2. An offering made of tsamba, butter and dry cheese in the shape of a cone.">tsog</a> (prayer assembly) 5 times every day where the tea that is served was like <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. &#xF50;&#xF74;&#xF42;&#xF0B;&#xF54;] 1.

Then I set up 20 dancers who were given tea and thukpa the same as the monks got when there was tsog. And I made the following rules: this <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. &#xF42;&#xF4F;&#xF7C;&#xF44;&#xF0B;&#xF66;&#xF92;&#xF7C;] A monastic obligation to provide the food and other necessary items served at a monastic prayer assembly meeting or some other rite; this was often a required obligation for monastic officials at the end of their term of office.">tonggo</a> shall be given by the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. &#xF56;&#xFB3;&#xF0B;&#xF56;&#xFB2;&#xF44;] 1.

Sizes of this unit varied somewhat, but the official government khe (called mkhar ru or bstan dzin mkha ru) weighed about 28-31 pounds for barley. It was used to convey the size of fields. For example, a field said to be 10 khe in size meant that 10 khe of seed could be sown on that field.">khe</a> of barley from each to the Nyertsang for making chang. The chang should not be too weak but also not too strong so that its makes the dancers drunk. And one <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. &#xF5F;&#xFB3;&#xF0B;&#xF5F;&#xF7C;] A wooden container used as a measurement unit in some localities that was a little bit larger than a dre [tib. &#xF56;&#xFB2;&#xF7A;].">daso</a> of <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. &#xF62;&#xFA9;&#xF58;&#xF0B;&#xF54;] The traditional Tibetan staple food that consists of grain that is roasted (popped), usually in heated sand, and then ground into a flour.">tsamba</a> will be given to each of the dancers by the Tratsang. The labrang will give one sowa [Tib. &#xF5F;&#xF7C;&#xF0B;&#xF56;] of mustard oil to each dancer, and when they need meat, the Nyertsang shall give it. Occasionally, special teas (Tib. &#xF4F;&#xF56;&#xF46; [&#xF66;&#xF9F;&#xF56;&#xF66;&#xF0B;&#xF47;]) shall be served by the Tratsang and the Nyertsang. In the 4th month, they were told to practice the dance and practice it using drums. In the 5th month, they told us they would have a rehearsal dance performance (Tib. troph&#xFC; [&#xF56;&#xFB2;&#xF7C;&#xF0B;&#xF55;&#xF74;&#xF51;]). Then I told them, &quot;You should get well prepared and we will have the rehearsal dance performance on the bathing picnic festival day (Tib. &#xF46;&#xF56;&#xF64;&#xF74;&#xF42; [&#xF46;&#xF56;&#xF0B;&#xF5E;&#xF74;&#xF42;&#xF66;] after the summer retreat [Tib. &#xF61;&#xF62;&#xFA3;&#xF7A;] is over. The rehearsal dance performance was wonderful. They danced very nicely and they also sang well. 10-15 days after the bathing picnic, we received an edict from the Penam Dzong heads saying that the monastic officials of the Penam Monastery should come to the dzong. So the Geg&#xF6; went there and they gave the order that the Dalai Lama is going to India so you should prepare the dancers and singers (Tib. &#xF4F;&#xFB2;&#xF7C;&#xF54;&#xF0B;&#xF64;&#xF7A;&#xF58; [&#xF56;&#xFB2;&#xF7C;&#xF0B;&#xF54;&#xF0B;&#xF42;&#xF5E;&#xF66;&#xF0B;&#xF58;].

Actually, how could I know that? I didn&apos;t even dream it. After that, when the Dalai Lama was coming, our dancers and singers stood on the road and danced and sang along with the religious procession, the sebang, and the Dalai Lama saw them dancing though he couldn&apos;t see it in detail. While the Dalai Lama went to India, I changed my thoughts in my bed and thought it would be good if I could invite the Dalai Lama to the Gadong Monastery. The next day I told my idea to the Chandz&#xF6; and he said that it would be wonderful and the miser also said the same thing. Then I send a petition to Kolkata through the Chemmo, and send a person to tell the Chandz&#xF6; Thabkhe la [Tib. &#xF50;&#xF56;&#xF66;&#xF0B;&#xF58;&#xF41;&#xF66;&#xF0B;&#xF63;&#xF42;&#xF66;] who was the representative of Drepung among the retinue, to remind (Tib. shabk&#xFC; [&#xF5E;&#xF56;&#xF66;&#xF0B;&#xF66;&#xF90;&#xF74;&#xF63;]) the Chemmo. I also planned to go to India, but Chemmo told me not to come. Then we also reported in Kalimpong and the first reminder was done in the Dunggar [Tib. &#xF51;&#xF74;&#xF44;&#xF0B;&#xF51;&#xF40;&#xF62;] Monastery. The second was done in Phari, and for the third I went to Gyantse to receive him. I went to see Phala Chemmo.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  At that time, where did Chemmo stay?   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  He stayed on his estate.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  At that time, the Dalai Lama was yet to come, right?   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  Yes. He said the Dalai Lama will come after two days and then I will be in Pegaw Ch&#xF6;de [Tib. &#xF51;&#xF54;&#xF63;&#xF0B;&#xF60;&#xF41;&#xF7C;&#xF62;&#xF0B;&#xF46;&#xF7C;&#xF66;&#xF0B;&#xF66;&#xFA1;&#xF7A;] [monastery]. When I went there, Chemmo was there. The Pej&#xF6; [Tib. &#xF51;&#xF54;&#xF63;&#xF0B;&#xF46;&#xF7C;&#xF66;] was the late Pema la [Tib. &#xF54;&#xF51;&#xF0B;&#xF58;&#xF0B;&#xF63;&#xF42;&#xF66;] and Thubden Nyima [Tib. &#xF50;&#xF74;&#xF56;&#xF0B;&#xF56;&#xF66;&#xF9F;&#xF53;&#xF0B;&#xF49;&#xF72;&#xF0B;&#xF58;] was the Shigatse Dzong head.

I reported to the Chemmo and he said he will make the report. I stayed for 3 days in Gyantse. One day, the Chemmo told me, &quot;Now, it is well done. The Dalai Lama has accepted it and it is confirmed.&quot; Now go back and get prepared. It was in the afternoon when I went to see the two tutors of the Dalai Lama and they said, &quot;You should get things prepared well. If you don&apos;t get them prepared well, it will be too bad [Tib. &#xF51;&#xF54;&#xF7A;&#xF0B;&#xF56;&#xF5F;&#xF7C;&#xF0B;&#xF42;&#xF72;&#xF0B;&#xF62;&#xF7A;&#xF51;].&quot; He asked me how I was preparing the kerosene pressure lamps [Tib. &#xF66;&#xF0B;&#xF5E;&#xF74;]. I said I have prepared 33 kerosene pressure lamps. Then he said, &quot;That&apos;s great. Otherwise, I was worried about the kerosene pressure lamps.&quot; I also asked Chemmo for a private audience with the Dalai Lama and Chemmo told me to register the request at the gaa. When I went back, it was so windy that I almost fell off my horse. We had already prepared everything and posted the notice for the accommodations (Tib. tserjar [mtsher sbyar] for the officials.   </p>

Altogether there were 6 riders and we went to the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. &#xF60;&#xF42;&#xF42;] 1. Abbreviation of Tsega, the Secretariat Office of the Dalai Lama.">gaa</a> to report. Kung&#xF6; Tara la [Tib. &#xF62;&#xF9F;&#xF0B;&#xF4F;&#xF0B;&#xF63;&#xF42;&#xF66;] was a tsendr&#xF6;n and Tempa la [Tib. &#xF56;&#xF66;&#xF9F;&#xF53;&#xF0B;&#xF54;&#xF0B;&#xF63;&#xF42;&#xF66;] was also a tsendr&#xF6;n. They told me, &quot;Whether they sent you or you came here in person, if you don&apos;t get well prepared, you will be responsible.&quot; So I was extremely frightened and thought of checking the bridge. When we walked on the bridge [near Gadong], we found that the bridge was moving [Tib. &#xF63;&#xFA1;&#xF7A;&#xF58;&#xF0B;&#xF62;&#xF92;&#xFB1;&#xF42;] and the bridge was also quite narrow.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  How wide was the bridge?   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  It was like the length from here to the bed over there.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  Were there arches on the bridge?   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  There were 3 arches. Then I saw there were 2 cars on the other side of the bridge and I told two monks to measure the car with a rope and I found the cars couldn&apos;t pass on the bridge. I felt like my heart had turned upside down. We tried to report it to the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. &#xF62;&#xFAB;&#xF7C;&#xF44;&#xF0B;&#xF51;&#xF54;&#xF7C;&#xF53;] The head of a dzong in the traditional Tibetan government.">dzongp&#xF6;n</a>, but he was a drunk who always drank chang. In Gadong, the storerooms were filled with wooden materials as we could cut trees because there were many orchards around the monastery. So I called all the monks to a <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. &#xF5A;&#xF7C;&#xF42;&#xF66;&#xF0B;&#xF60;&#xF51;&#xF74;] 1. The general name for the various types of Tibetan government assemblies. 2. Any assembly, e.g., the assembly (meeting) of monks in a college.">tsondu</a> assembly and organized 50 strong monks and 50-60 strong men from the miser. There was a total of 130 people. I called them to a meeting and told them about building the bridge. They all said, &quot;Sure. We don&apos;t have any choice, but to do this meritorious work. I told them to bring their implements and divide up the places to work.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  How many <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. &#xF58;&#xF72;&#xF0B;&#xF66;&#xF7A;&#xF62;] A term that can mean serf/bound subject as well as citizen, depending on context. For example, the miser of a lord would connote the bound subjects of that lord, whereas the miser of Tibet would connote citizens of Tibet.">miser</a> were there?   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  I made the number of <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. &#xF58;&#xF72;&#xF0B;&#xF66;&#xF7A;&#xF62;] A term that can mean serf/bound subject as well as citizen, depending on context. For example, the miser of a lord would connote the bound subjects of that lord, whereas the miser of Tibet would connote citizens of Tibet.">miser</a> the same as the number of monks. Then I called 2 blacksmiths, two masons, two carpenters and there were some monks who knew masonry. We used the wood materials we had stored in the five pillar store room and brought the wood by carrying it on the shoulders of 4 or 6 people. Then we took <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. &#xF62;&#xFA9;&#xF58;&#xF0B;&#xF54;] The traditional Tibetan staple food that consists of grain that is roasted (popped), usually in sand, and then ground into a flour.">tsampa</a>, tea leaves and butter. I sent a monk riding a horse to deliver a message to the households located near the bridge saying &quot;Tonight around midnight about 100 people are coming there carrying wood so please make a good amount of <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. 1. &#xF46;&#xF44;, 2. &#xF56;&#xFB1;&#xF44;] 1. Tibetan locally brewed barley beer. 2. North; nomad areas north of Lhasa in Nagchuga Prefecture 3. ch. &#x5382; factory.">chang</a> for the miser and good tea for the monks and also a good <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. &#xF50;&#xF74;&#xF42;&#xF0B;&#xF54;] 1. A porridge or gruel-like soup typically made with tsamba, and if available, meat and cheese. 2. Noodle dishes in broth.">thukpa</a> made from flattened barley (Tib. &#xF53;&#xF7A;&#xF46;&#xF42; [&#xF53;&#xF66;&#xF0B;&#xF46;&#xF42;]). Maybe this will help make it a little bit easier to carry the wood. I will pay for all this afterwards. We left when it became dark and the messenger was coming back saying the households said that they will do as you said. When we got there, they had everything ready, even the buckets were full of chang and loads of tsampa were ready and they served us <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. &#xF66;&#xFA4;&#xF42;&#xF66;] A staple Tibetan dish of tsampa mixed with tea and kneaded into balls of dough-like consistency.">pag</a> and boiled meat.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  Did you go with them?   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  Yes, I had to go there and make them do the work well. Otherwise, they wouldn&apos;t. The Geg&#xF6; was also there and altogether there were ten riders. We arrived there around 2 a.m. and then at dawn all of the workers had to get into the icy water and they were all shivering. Then they set up 4 big beams on the pillars in the water and the blacksmith started the bellows and attached the pillars with iron nails. Then the bridge became very wide, even wider than the rope measurement. At around sunrise, the work was finished and then we drew yellow lines on both sides and also put stone lines (Tib. &#xF51;&#xF7C;&#xF4F;&#xF62; [&#xF62;&#xFA1;&#xF7C;&#xF0B;&#xF66;&#xF9F;&#xF62;]) and we also built two incense burners that were cone shaped (Tib. &#xF66;&#xF44;&#xF41;&#xF74;&#xF44; [&#xF56;&#xF66;&#xF44;&#xF66;&#xF0B;&#xF41;&#xF74;&#xF44;]). Around 8 a.m everything was finished. Then all the people drank tea and ate food.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  You did it very fast, right?   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  Yes because there were many people and a lot of wood. The materials were almost used up. There was just a little bit left.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  How much wood did you haul?   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  We hauled about 20 some pieces of wood. The bridge was built so strong that it was not carried away even in the summer when the water was in spate. And then the two <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. &#xF62;&#xFAB;&#xF7C;&#xF44;] A district in the traditional Tibetan governmental structure. This large administrative unit was headed by one or two district heads (tib. dzongp&#xF6;n [&#xF62;&#xFAB;&#xF7C;&#xF44;&#xF0B;&#xF51;&#xF54;&#xF7C;&#xF53;]) appointed by the Tibetan government. Typically there was one lay official and one monk official who were jointly sent from Lhasa for three year terms. They were responsible for collecting taxes and adjudicating disputes in their district. These dzong were equivalent to counties (ch. &#x53BF;) in the current Chinese system of administration.">dzong</a> heads came and I scolded them in a sarcastic manner, saying, &quot;You have really done a good job. That bridge was so bad that we would not dare to show our face.&quot; I asked some monks to yell when the vehicles passed the bridge and they yelled, &quot;Two vehicles have crossed the bridge and then they passed the sandy area.&quot; On the day after tomorrow, the Dalai Lama was to come and the monk official cooks [Tib. &#xF42;&#xF66;&#xF7C;&#xF63;&#xF0B;&#xF50;&#xF56;&#xF0B;&#xF54;] arrived near the main gate and <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. &#xF62;&#xFA9;&#xF7A;&#xF0B;&#xF58;&#xF42;&#xFB2;&#xF7C;&#xF53;] The monk officials working as aides in the Tse ga, the Secretariat of the Dalai Lama.">Tsendr&#xF6;n</a> Tempa la was with them. Later, Chemmo said, &quot;I have sent exclusively the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. &#xF62;&#xFA9;&#xF7A;&#xF0B;&#xF51;&#xFB2;&#xF74;&#xF44;] A monk official in the Tibetan government.">tsidrung</a> who are from Drepung.&quot; All of their ears were blocked with the dust and we served them tea and told them to check the accommodations and the seating arrangements. Tsendr&#xF6;n Tempa la said, &quot;It is well done. I swear by the Shri Devi that there is nothing to suggest except some directions where the cushions should be placed.&quot; On the next day, the Dalai Lama came and we also received the teachings and it was a very meritorious occasion (Tib. &#xF40;&#xF7A;&#xF63;&#xFA4;&#xF0B;&#xF66;&#xF44;&#xF54;&#xF7C; [&#xF56;&#xF66;&#xF90;&#xF63;&#xF0B;&#xF54;&#xF0B;&#xF56;&#xF5F;&#xF44;&#xF0B;&#xF54;&#xF7C;]).

Then we sought a private audience with the Dalai Lama and he said. &quot;I enjoyed myself and the food was also good. Thank you.&quot; To tell only you Kung&#xF6;, &quot;I swear by the Buddha&apos;s statue in the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. &#xF47;&#xF7C;&#xF0B;&#xF41;&#xF44;] A most famous temple in Lhasa that houses a holy statue of the Buddha.

The two head disciplinary officials for all of Drepung Monastery and for the M&#xF6;nlam Prayer Festival.">Shengo</a> position if I wanted it.&quot; The Dalai Lama told me, &quot;Didn&apos;t you become a Shengo?&quot; Then the late Simp&#xF6;n Khembo said, &quot;He didn&apos;t become a Shengo.&quot; And Chemmo said, &quot;He was among the candidates, but he was among the ones who fell on their ass (Tib. &#xF40;&#xF74;&#xF56;&#xF51;&#xF56; [&#xF62;&#xF90;&#xF74;&#xF56;&#xF0B;&#xF56;&#xF62;&#xFA1;&#xF56;]).&quot; So the Dalai Lama laughed and said, &quot;Oh! He was among those who stuck adhesive tape on their buttocks, right? Was the sore big? [Tib. &#xF68;&#xF0B;&#xF63;&#xF7A;&#xF0D; &#xF62;&#xF90;&#xF74;&#xF56;&#xF0B;&#xF63;&#xF0B;&#xF40;&#xF7C;&#xF0B;&#xF61;&#xF7C;&#xF63;&#xF0B;&#xF66;&#xFA6;&#xFB1;&#xF62;&#xF0B;&#xF58;&#xF41;&#xF53;&#xF0B;&#xF42;&#xFB2;&#xF66;&#xF0B;&#xF62;&#xF7A;&#xF51;&#xF0B;&#xF54;&#xF66;&#xF0D; &#xF62;&#xFA8;&#xF0B;&#xF46;&#xF7A;&#xF53;&#xF0B;&#xF54;&#xF7C;&#xF0B;&#xF56;&#xF5F;&#xF7C;&#xF66;&#xF0B;&#xF60;&#xF51;&#xF74;&#xF42;&#xF0B;&#xF42;&#xF66;]. And then he said, &quot;You must come down and become a Shengo. If you want to stay here, you can stay. Otherwise you come down [to Lhasa] and become a Shengo and have your shoulders padded [Tib. &#xF68;&#xF7C;&#xF0B;&#xF56;&#xF7C;&#xF42;] [the special dress of the Shengo has padded shoulders]. You are eloquent, right? [unclear].&quot; Before the Dalai Lama left he said that he will pray for us and he said the monastery seems to be too small for the monks. We performed the dance when the Dalai Lama was coming from India [in 1957] and he came to our monastery. The dance was performed on the stone floor [courtyard].   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  How many days did the Dalai Lama stay in your monastery?   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  He stayed 2 days and left on the third day.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  Did the dancers do well?   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  Yes. And the dancers also got an audience with the Dalai Lama after their performance. The <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. &#xF62;&#xFAB;&#xF7C;&#xF44;] A district in the traditional Tibetan governmental structure.

They were responsible for collecting taxes and adjudicating disputes in their district. These dzong were equivalent to counties (ch. &#x53BF;) in the current Chinese system of administration.">dzong</a> head came and on that day Gadong monastery was packed with people. The Dalai Lama left on the morning of 29th. And he arrived Shigatse on the 3rd.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  So he purposely came to Gadong, right?   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  Yes, he came purposely. His route was on the other side of the river and Gadong was located on the opposite side, so he had to make a detour to come to Gadong. It was really a joyful event for us and my work on that had been useful [Tib. &#xF42;&#xF7C;&#xF66;&#xF0B;&#xF46;&#xF7C;&#xF51;&#xF0B;&#xF54;]. On the evening of 2nd, we crossed the river carrying <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. &#xF41;&#xF0B;&#xF56;&#xF4F;&#xF42;&#xF66;] A Tibetan ceremonial scarf given to lamas, visitors, etc.">khata</a> scarves and transported the things with our animals and prepared for the religious possession, the sebang.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  How many monks were there?   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  There were about 500. On that day, a vehicle stopped there on the way and it was the Chemmo who asked me, &quot;How much work do you have here?&quot; I said, &quot;I have to give the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. &#xF42;&#xF4F;&#xF7C;&#xF44;&#xF0B;&#xF66;&#xF92;&#xF7C;] A monastic obligation to provide the food and other necessary items served at a monastic prayer assembly meeting or some other rite; this was often a required obligation for monastic officials at the end of their term of office.">tonggo</a> here.&quot; He said, &quot;That is good&quot; [unclear]. After the Dalai Lama left, we concluded the sebang and we ate food and returned to the monastery. On the 4th day, 20 some of the dancers and the singers (Tib. &#xF4F;&#xFB2;&#xF7C;&#xF54;&#xF0B;&#xF64;&#xF7A;&#xF58; [&#xF56;&#xFB2;&#xF7C;&#xF0B;&#xF54;&#xF0B;&#xF42;&#xF5E;&#xF66;&#xF0B;&#xF58;]) came to Gadong to perform. After that, the Gyangkhara [Tib. &#xF62;&#xF92;&#xFB1;&#xF44;&#xF0B;&#xF58;&#xF41;&#xF62;&#xF0B;&#xF56;] opera group came since we had said that if the ceremony was successful, we would take [hire] the opera. So Gyangkhara did the rehearsal performance in the evening and on the next day, they performed the opera story &quot;Princess Wenchang&quot; [Tib. &#xF62;&#xF92;&#xFB1;&#xF0B;&#xF56;&#xF5F;&#xF60;] and on the next day, they performed the opera story called Norsang [Tib. &#xF53;&#xF7C;&#xF62;&#xF0B;&#xF56;&#xF5F;&#xF44;]. At that time, the two Dzong heads and I were sitting in the front with the big windows (Tib. &#xF62;&#xF56;&#xF66;&#xF7A; [&#xF62;&#xF56;&#xF0B;&#xF42;&#xF66;&#xF63;].

I was extremely frightened (Tib. nying tsalong [snying tsha long]. The adrung delivered an edict sent from the gaa. I opened it and it said that I must come to Shigatse&apos;s Dechen Phodrang [Tib. &#xF56;&#xF51;&#xF7A;&#xF0B;&#xF46;&#xF7A;&#xF53;&#xF0B;&#xF55;&#xF7C;&#xF0B;&#xF56;&#xFB2;&#xF44;] Palace [of the Panchen Lama] at the time of the drungja. After this I wasn&apos;t in the mood to watch the opera. I gave some food to the messenger. I asked a lama to do a divination about this and he said, &quot;The divination is good. There will be no problem. You don&apos;t need to worry about that. The divination shows that you will get something good [Tib. &#xF42;&#xFB2;&#xF7C;&#xF42;&#xF66;&#xF0B;&#xF66;&#xF0B;&#xF46;&#xF7A;&#xF53;&#xF0B;&#xF54;&#xF7C;&#xF0B;&#xF60;&#xF51;&#xF74;&#xF42;].&quot; So I relaxed a little bit. After that, I gave the opera performers the gifts and I took my saddle bag and the prepared <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. &#xF62;&#xFA9;&#xF58;&#xF0B;&#xF54;] The traditional Tibetan staple food that consists of grain that is roasted (popped), usually in sand, and then ground into a flour.">tsampa</a>, tea leaves and the butter and left the next day at dawn with two monk servants. I also told them to send some fuel [to Shigatse] in case I have to stay there for some time. I didn&apos;t need to go to the dzong because the Chemmo was not there. At that time, the Panchen Lama was riding with his band of horsemen and was going for a pilgrimage [outside the city].   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  When the Dalai Lama came, was the Panchen Lama going for pilgrimage with his attendants?   </p>

When I went to Chemmo&apos;s house at sunrise, there were many people packed in there to see him. Altogether, there were about 20 monks and laymen. At that time, Chemmo had been to the toilet. I bowed when Chemmo was coming back from the toilet and Chemmo told me, &quot;Urgyen La, come in.&quot; Then he told me to come to the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. &#xF60;&#xF42;&#xF42;] 1.

So I told them [the Tashilhunpo officials], how about putting the throne in that new room, but they said that it is not okay because [unclear].

It is just a few months since then so why did they [Tashilhunpo officials] say that it is not okay to put the throne there?&quot; Chemmo said, &quot;Yes, you are right, but they just put the throne right here&quot; When we told them [the Tashilhunpo officials], &quot;How about lending us a better throne&quot; [Tib. &#xF56;&#xF5E;&#xF74;&#xF42;&#xF66;&#xF0B;&#xF41;&#xFB2;&#xF72;&#xF0B;&#xF51;&#xFB2;&#xF42;&#xF0B;&#xF54;&#xF0B;&#xF5E;&#xF72;&#xF42;&#xF0B;&#xF42;&#xF61;&#xF62;&#xF0B;&#xF54;&#xF7C;&#xF0B;&#xF5E;&#xF74;&#xF66;&#xF0B;&#xF53;], they said, &quot;We have to report this to the Panchen Lama, so we can&apos;t make a decision until we get approval from the Panchen Lama.&quot; At that time, it was 9-10 a.m. and the Dalai Lama was going to arrive at 12, So we told them that you don&apos;t need to report to the Panchen Lama, [unclear] Then it was said that the soldiers of the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. &#xF42;&#xF0B;&#xF51;&#xF44;] The army regiment whose troops were recruited from the Shigatse area. &quot;Ga&quot; refers to the third letter of the Tibetan alphabet.">Gadang</a> Regiment will bring a throne and religious decorations and cushions, etc. from the Governor&apos;s Headquarters (Tib. &#xF47;&#xF72;&#xF5B;&#xF7C;&#xF44; [Tib. &#xF66;&#xFA4;&#xFB1;&#xF72;&#xF0B;&#xF62;&#xFAB;&#xF7C;&#xF44;]) to the Dechen Phodrang. He [Chemmo] told me that I have to be the main one in charge of arranging the throne, etc. like I did for the ceremony in the M&#xF6;nlam when the Dalai Lama came to the tsog. He said that some tsidrung will help me. The tsidrung also told me, &quot;You tell us what to do. We have been told to help you and we will help you.&quot; I told them please don&apos;t say that. Anyway, we were able to finish arranging these things before 12 p.m. Then the Dalai Lama arrived.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  Was that <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. &#xF56;&#xF40;&#xFB2;&#xF0B;&#xF66;&#xF72;&#xF66;&#xF0B;&#xF63;&#xFB7;&#xF74;&#xF53;&#xF0B;&#xF54;&#xF7C;] The famous Gelugpa Monastery of the Panchen Lama located in Shigatse.">Tashilhunpo</a> Khenche there?   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  He returned with a angry face because no one paid attention to him. Later, there was not a single <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. &#xF56;&#xF40;&#xFB2;&#xF0B;&#xF66;&#xF72;&#xF66;&#xF0B;&#xF63;&#xFB7;&#xF74;&#xF53;&#xF0B;&#xF54;&#xF7C;] The famous Gelugpa Monastery of the Panchen Lama located in Shigatse.">Tashilhunpo</a> monk there because Tashilhunpo stopped them from coming to see the Dalai Lama by paying them their grain salary on that same day, saying that today is the day for paying [the monk&apos;s] grain salary. They gave orders to the monks saying [that if they went to see the Dalai Lama], &quot;They will not get the grain salary and will be expelled from the Tashilhunpo community (kyidu).&quot; However, there were about 1,000 monks who came from other monasteries around Shigatse like Shang Ganden Ch&#xF6;ngor and Gadong, and Chemmo told me to arrange for those monks to come to seek the audience like we did during the M&#xF6;nlam. He said that I should stay there all the time and he [Chemmo] will come soon. The palace was packed with monks. When the Dalai Lama came and was about to start his dharma teaching, the monks from Tashilhunpo didn&apos;t take the grain salary and rushed in like the sebang religious possession. They were saying, &quot;We don&apos;t care what will happen to us, even getting expelled from the monastic community&quot; (kyidu [Tib. &#xF66;&#xF90;&#xFB1;&#xF72;&#xF51;&#xF0B;&#xF66;&#xFA1;&#xF74;&#xF42;&#xF0B;&#xF58;&#xF72;&#xF0B;&#xF51;&#xF42;&#xF7C;&#xF66;&#xF0B;&#xF42;&#xF0B;&#xF62;&#xF7A;&#xF0B;&#xF55;&#xF74;&#xF51;&#xF0B;&#xF53;&#xF60;&#xF72;&#xF0B;&#xF55;&#xF74;&#xF51;]. So about 1,000 Tashilhunpo monks rushed in and the whole place was packed and even the stables were packed with monks. [unclear]   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  What dharma teaching did the Dalai Lama give?   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  I don&apos;t know for sure. He gave the teaching for two days and on the evening of the second day, the Dalai Lama went to Ngor [Tib. &#xF44;&#xF7C;&#xF62;] Monastery. I went to see Chemmo because he called me. [unclear]. Thubden Nyima and Trekhang Samchog La [Tib. &#xF56;&#xF40;&#xFB2;&#xF66;&#xF0B;&#xF41;&#xF44;&#xF0B;&#xF56;&#xF66;&#xF58;&#xF0B;&#xF58;&#xF46;&#xF7C;&#xF42;&#xF0B;&#xF63;&#xF42;&#xF66;] were also there. I gave a <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. &#xF41;&#xF0B;&#xF56;&#xF4F;&#xF42;&#xF66;] A Tibetan ceremonial scarf given to lamas, visitors, etc.">khata</a> scarf and asked Chemmo, &quot;May I leave after the teaching is over.&quot; He said, &quot;What the hell are you doing talking like a crazy person. You are provoking me.&quot; [Tib. &#xF58;&#xF72;&#xF0B;&#xF66;&#xFA8;&#xFB1;&#xF7C;&#xF53;&#xF0B;&#xF54;&#xF60;&#xF72;&#xF0B;&#xF56;&#xF5F;&#xF7C;&#xF0B;&#xF60;&#xF51;&#xFB2;&#xF0B;&#xF54;&#xF7C;&#xF0B;&#xF60;&#xF51;&#xF72;&#xF66;&#xF0B;&#xF44;&#xF0B;&#xF63;&#xF0B;&#xF56;&#xF66;&#xF99;&#xF51;&#xF0B;&#xF56;&#xF62;&#xF90;&#xF7C;&#xF0B;&#xF42;&#xF72;&#xF0B;&#xF60;&#xF51;&#xF74;&#xF42;]. This was not done by me. This was done in accordance with the [Dalai Lama&apos;s] order (Tib. &#xF40;&#xF53;&#xF51;&#xFB2;&#xF7A; [&#xF56;&#xF40;&#xF60;&#xF0B;&#xF60;&#xF56;&#xFB2;&#xF7A;&#xF63;]).&quot; [unclear] Then I said, &quot;If so, I am sorry.&quot; Then Chemmo said, &quot;You go back tomorrow morning and come down on the day after tomorrow to the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. &#xF60;&#xF42;&#xF42;] The Secretariat Office of either the Dalai Lama (tib. &#xF59;&#xF7A;&#xF0B;&#xF42;&#xF42; [&#xF62;&#xFA9;&#xF7A;&#xF0B;&#xF60;&#xF42;&#xF42;]) or the Regent (tib. sh&#xF6; gag [&#xF5E;&#xF7C;&#xF63;&#xF0B;&#xF60;&#xF42;&#xF42;]).">gag</a>&quot; On the third day when I was coming down through the east bridge (Tib. &#xF66;&#xF58;&#xF54;&#xF0B;&#xF64;&#xF62; [&#xF5F;&#xF58;&#xF0B;&#xF54;&#xF0B;&#xF64;&#xF62;]), the drum was being beaten by the Dalai Lama&apos;s dance group (Tib. &#xF51;&#xF58; [&#xF56;&#xF62;&#xFA1;&#xF0B;&#xF58;]) which indicated that the Dalai Lama was coming. Then I went to the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. &#xF60;&#xF42;&#xF42;] 1. Abbreviation of Tsega, the Secretariat Office of the Dalai Lama.">gaa</a> after having my breakfast. Then someone was coming and asking where is the Gadong monk, so I reported my arrival and I was told to make a list of the people coming to seek an audience with the Dalai Lama. So I made the list and gave it to Chemmo. Gadong sent me foodstuffs and also I got tea in the drungja.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  So Chemmo called you to work there when the Dalai Lama was in Shigatse and you worked until the Dalai Lama went to Ngor Monastery, right? Tell me what you did after that?   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  After that, I would go to the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. &#xF51;&#xFB2;&#xF74;&#xF44;&#xF0B;&#xF47;] The daily meeting of Tibetan government monk officials (tsedrung) at which tea was provided. However, unlike the collective meetings of monks in monasteries, there was no collective chanting of prayers at the Drungja. The event started at around 9 a.m. and lasted for about an hour. When the Tse ga (the Dalai Lama&apos;s Secretariat) was in the Potala, it was held there, and when it was in the Norbulinga Summer Palace, it was held there. All monk officials in Lhasa were expected to attend.">drungja</a> in the morning and when someone wanted to seek an audience with the Dalai Lama, I reported that to the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. &#xF60;&#xF42;&#xF42;] 1. Abbreviation of Tsega, the Secretariat Office of the Dalai Lama.">gaa</a> and the Chemmo would consult about that and then I would come back home after the drungja. I served like this until the Dalai Lama went to Shang Ganden Ch&#xF6;ngor [Tib. &#xF64;&#xF44;&#xF66;&#xF0B;&#xF51;&#xF42;&#xF60;&#xF0B;&#xF63;&#xFA1;&#xF53;&#xF0B;&#xF46;&#xF7C;&#xF66;&#xF0B;&#xF60;&#xF41;&#xF7C;&#xF62;] and then I came back to Gadong on the day that the Dalai Lama went through the Shugola [Tib. &#xF64;&#xF7C;&#xF42;&#xF0B;&#xF56;&#xF74;&#xF0B;&#xF63;] Mountain Pass [to Yangpajen and then to Lhasa].   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  What did you do after coming back to Gadong?   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  After a month, I came to Lhasa and then went back [to Gadong] in the 6th lunar month.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  When you went back to Gadong, did the Nyertsang and those people ask you what you had done?   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  They wouldn&apos;t ask these things.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  Was that because you were the highest authority?   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  Yes. They wouldn&apos;t dare to ask me. They would always say you have done very well [Tib. &#xF42;&#xF44;&#xF0B;&#xF58;&#xF72;&#xF53;&#xF0B;&#xF5A;&#xF51;&#xF0B;&#xF56;&#xFB1;&#xF74;&#xF44;&#xF0B;&#xF56;&#xF5E;&#xF42;].   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  However, did you report to the abbot?   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  I informed the abbot and he said, &quot;We have heard that. It is well known to everyone.&quot;   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  Did you stay in Lhasa between the M&#xF6;nlam and <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. &#xF5A;&#xF7C;&#xF42;&#xF66;&#xF0B;&#xF58;&#xF46;&#xF7C;&#xF51;] The large religious prayer festival held in Lhasa in the 2nd Tibetan lunar month.">Tsongj&#xF6;</a> [Prayer Festivals]?   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  Yes. Then I sought an audience with the Dalai Lama and returned in the 5th month.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  What did you do in Lhasa between that time?   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  I just stayed in the monastery [Drepung, Loseling]. The Tratsang made me do some miscellaneous work. Sometimes I had to go to the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. &#xF56;&#xFB3;&#xF0B;&#xF66;&#xFA4;&#xFB1;&#xF72;] The highest administrative council in large monasteries, like Drepung.

Sometime, I said I am coming on behalf of the Tratsang and sometimes I said it was on behalf of the Jiso and sometimes I said it was for the Riji.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  The last time we met we talked about the Tratsang and such things, but we didn&apos;t talk about the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. &#xF62;&#xF72;&#xF42;&#xF66;&#xF0B;&#xF66;&#xFA4;&#xFB1;&#xF72;] The monastic committee that consisted of the six incumbent Drepung abbots.

<p><strong>A:</strong>  It was because they had to give 18 <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. &#xF42;&#xF4F;&#xF7C;&#xF44;&#xF0B;&#xF66;&#xF92;&#xF7C;] A monastic obligation to provide the food and other necessary items served at a monastic prayer assembly meeting or some other rite; this was often a required obligation for monastic officials at the end of their term of office.">tonggo</a> called rigdra.   </p>

<p><strong>A:</strong>  This ceremony was originated by Jayan Ch&#xF6;je [Tib. &#xF60;&#xF47;&#xF58;&#xF0B;&#xF51;&#xF56;&#xFB1;&#xF44;&#xF66;&#xF0B;&#xF46;&#xF7C;&#xF66;&#xF0B;&#xF62;&#xF97;&#xF7A;]. They had to collect barley, butter, etc. for doing these.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  Was that ceremony for the founding of Drepung Monastery?   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  I don&apos;t know what the ceremony was for. The abbots would say, &quot;We are the S&#xF6;p&#xF6;n and Chandz&#xF6; of Jayan Ch&#xF6;je and we are collecting the income and giving the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. &#xF42;&#xF4F;&#xF7C;&#xF44;&#xF0B;&#xF66;&#xF92;&#xF7C;] A monastic obligation to provide the food and other necessary items served at a monastic prayer assembly meeting or some other rite; this was often a required obligation for monastic officials at the end of their term of office.">tonggo</a> according to what was written in the book, and we do the p&#xF6;kor [Tib. &#xF66;&#xFA4;&#xF7C;&#xF66;&#xF0B;&#xF66;&#xF90;&#xF7C;&#xF62;])[walk around the tsog prayer assembly carrying incense]. ...&quot;   </p>

When people came to offer <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. &#xF41;&#xF0B;&#xF56;&#xF4F;&#xF42;&#xF66;] A Tibetan ceremonial scarf given to lamas, visitors, etc.">khata</a> scarves, he was staying in his <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. 1. &#xF64;&#xF42;, 2. &#xF5E;&#xF42;] 1. The apartment/room of a monk. 2. The butter fat that coagulates on the top of butter-tea when the tea is left to sit for some time. If the tea had been made with a lot of butter, this layer could be thick enough to scoop off and save to later sell or eat separately. The senior monks are usually served tea with a lot of shag.">shag</a> and he said, &quot;Make a kettle of good butter tea and good meat <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. &#xF58;&#xF7C;&#xF42;&#xF0B;&#xF58;&#xF7C;&#xF42;] Stuffed dumplings.">momo</a> and a radish dish. This is enough because we are not kudrak. In the evening make a <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. &#xF62;&#xFA9;&#xF58;&#xF0B;&#xF54;] The traditional Tibetan staple food that consists of grain that is roasted (popped), usually in sand, and then ground into a flour.">tsampa</a> soup and eat it before going to bed.&quot; He was really like a dobdo. He would give the monks whatever he got from the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. &#xF56;&#xFB3;&#xF0B;&#xF66;&#xFA4;&#xFB1;&#xF72;] The highest administrative council in large monasteries, like Drepung. It consisted of the Abbots, the Tshogchen Umdze, the Shengo and the Jiso. In Drepung it also included ex-abbots.">Laji</a>. In the Laji, he would also make the other abbots do work like counting money and folding khata scarves, etc. He would not make the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. &#xF5E;&#xF63;&#xF0B;&#xF44;&#xF7C;] 1.

The two head disciplinary officials for all of Drepung Monastery and for the M&#xF6;nlam Prayer Festival.">Shengo</a> do work like this. He regarded the Shengo very highly and asked them, &quot;Don&apos;t the two of you feel cold?&quot; [Tib. &#xF66;&#xF90;&#xF74;&#xF0B;&#xF5E;&#xF56;&#xF66;&#xF0B;&#xF62;&#xFA3;&#xF58;&#xF0B;&#xF54;&#xF0B;&#xF42;&#xF49;&#xF72;&#xF66;&#xF0B;&#xF66;&#xF90;&#xF74;&#xF0B;&#xF56;&#xF66;&#xF72;&#xF63;&#xF0B;&#xF42;&#xFB1;&#xF72;&#xF0B;&#xF58;&#xF72;&#xF0B;&#xF60;&#xF51;&#xF74;&#xF42;&#xF0B;&#xF42;&#xF58;] and he would tell the Lama Chandz&#xF6; to serve them tea. He regarded the other abbots as his <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. &#xF51;&#xF42;&#xF7A;&#xF0B;&#xF55;&#xFB2;&#xF74;&#xF42;] 1. Student. 2. Disciple. 3. Commonly the name for monks living with a gegen or teacher. These are more like wards than real disciples.">gidru</a> (disciples).   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  How old was he then?   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  He was a little over 60. He would manage the funds very economically (Tib. &#xF47;&#xF7C;&#xF42;&#xF54;&#xF7C; [&#xF63;&#xF95;&#xF42;&#xF66;&#xF0B;&#xF54;&#xF7C;]). After counting the money, he would ask whether there were people taking loans and if there was no one taking loans, he would consult the other abbots about what they should do with the money. If no one answered, he would say, &quot;Let us, the 11 abbots and ex-abbots, the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. &#xF5A;&#xF7C;&#xF42;&#xF66;&#xF0B;&#xF46;&#xF7A;&#xF53;] The main assembly hall of a monastery.

The two head disciplinary officials for all of Drepung Monastery and for the M&#xF6;nlam Prayer Festival.">Shengo</a> for doing this because they have to give tonggo.&quot; And he would note down the date.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  Did he charge interest for the money that was divided up?   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  Yes. He fixed the interest from the beginning and he also paid it like all the others. He also divided the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. &#xF41;&#xF0B;&#xF56;&#xF4F;&#xF42;&#xF66;] A Tibetan ceremonial scarf given to lamas, visitors, etc.">khata</a> scarves and the rice offerings they got in the M&#xF6;nlam and fixed the cost of the khata scarves and the rice.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  Did they have to buy it whether they wanted it or not?   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  Yes. He was forcing them to buy (Tib. &#xF56;&#xF58;&#xF59;&#xF7C;&#xF44; [&#xF60;&#xF56;&#xF58;&#xF0B;&#xF5A;&#xF7C;&#xF44;]) [at a loss]. He would tell them to bring the money on a fixed date and he also paid first. Then he would seek permission from the two <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. &#xF5E;&#xF63;&#xF0B;&#xF44;&#xF7C;] 1. A junior officer in the traditional Tibetan Army in charge of a unit (platoon) of 25 soldiers (same as dingp&#xF6;n). 2.

<p><strong>Q:</strong>  This was the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. &#xF60;&#xF42;&#xFB1;&#xF7A;] Alms given to monks.">gye</a> from the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. &#xF56;&#xFB3;&#xF0B;&#xF66;&#xFA4;&#xFB1;&#xF72;] The highest administrative council in large monasteries, like Drepung. It consisted of the Abbots, the Tshogchen Umdze, the Shengo and the Jiso. In Drepung it also included ex-abbots.">Laji</a>, right?   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  Yes. When the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. &#xF56;&#xFB3;&#xF0B;&#xF66;&#xFA4;&#xFB1;&#xF72;] The highest administrative council in large monasteries, like Drepung. It consisted of the Abbots, the Tshogchen Umdze, the Shengo and the Jiso. In Drepung it also included ex-abbots.">Laji</a> had to work a little longer, he would tell the Lama Chandz&#xF6; to make a kettle of tea and dumplings [Ch. shui jiao zi] or the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. &#xF50;&#xF74;&#xF42;&#xF0B;&#xF54;] 1. A porridge or gruel-like soup typically made with tsamba, and if available, meat and cheese. 2. Noodle dishes in broth.">thukpa</a> called Gutsi Rithug [Ch. hou zi er do]. The Lama Chandz&#xF6; would make a big kettle of tea because he could take the left over tea and food [for himself]. But when Jungne saw that the Lama Chandz&#xF6; taking some more butter, he would ask, &quot;What is that for?&quot; and when the Lama Chandz&#xF6; said that he wanted to make more tea, Jungne la would say, &quot;You don&apos;t need to make it because it is almost time to close the office (Tib. lhengye tr&#xF6; [&#xF63;&#xFB7;&#xF53;&#xF0B;&#xF62;&#xF92;&#xFB1;&#xF66;&#xF0B;&#xF42;&#xFB2;&#xF7C;&#xF63;]).&quot; He would shake the kettle and say you don&apos;t need to make more tea. He also would go to the kitchen and tell the Lama Chandz&#xF6;, &quot;You leave this leftover food and warm it and serve it tomorrow.&quot;   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  Where was he born?   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  He was born in T&#xF6;lung [Tib. &#xF66;&#xF9F;&#xF7C;&#xF51;&#xF0B;&#xF63;&#xF74;&#xF44;] and he died in Tibet.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  Did he die in Tibet before the revolt?   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  Yes, the revolt happened 5 years after he died. He came to the M&#xF6;nlam for two days and did his prayers and went back to the monastery and on his way back to Drepung he went to <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. &#xF53;&#xF7C;&#xF62;&#xF0B;&#xF56;&#xF74;&#xF0B;&#xF42;&#xFB3;&#xF72;&#xF44;&#xF0B;&#xF41;] The summer palace of the Dalai Lama.">Norbulinga</a> and <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. &#xF62;&#xFA9;&#xF7A;] The Potala Palace.">Tse</a> (Potala) for pilgrimage and then on the next day he died. His body remained in a meditative state without decomposing for 5-6 days (Tib. thukdam lashug [thugs dam la bzhugs] so he became famous. Later, people were saying that we don&apos;t regret whatever we spend for the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. &#xF56;&#xFB3;&#xF0B;&#xF66;&#xFA4;&#xFB1;&#xF72;] The highest administrative council in large monasteries, like Drepung. It consisted of the Abbots, the Tshogchen Umdze, the Shengo and the Jiso. In Drepung it also included ex-abbots.">Laji</a> because it is used in a good way and he would not let people do something tricky [Tib. &#xF62;&#xF0B;&#xF56;&#xF72;&#xF0B;&#xF62;&#xF72;&#xF0B;&#xF56;&#xF72;] even with regard to 5 <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. &#xF66;&#xF90;&#xF62;&#xF0B;&#xF58;] 1.

Usually our <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. &#xF42;&#xFB2;&#xFAD;&#xF0B;&#xF5A;&#xF44;] A &quot;college&quot; within a monastery, for example, in Drepung Monastery there were four main tratsang: Gomang, Loseling, Deyang and Ngagpa. These tratsang were property owning corporate entities and included monks who were organized into residential dormitories called Khamtsen.">tratsang</a> abbot [Jungne] would make a speech saying, &quot;The main persons in charge of the Laji is the incumbent abbots and the ex-abbots will assist them. You just drink good tea and chitchat and pretend that you don&apos;t know anything. You shouldn&apos;t behave like this. It is shameful.&quot; [Tib. &#xF51;&#xF7A;&#xF0B;&#xF60;&#xF51;&#xFB2;&#xF0B;&#xF58;&#xF0B;&#xF42;&#xF53;&#xF44;&#xF0D; &#xF44;&#xF7C;&#xF0B;&#xF5A;]. Anyway, Jungne didn&apos;t regard the other abbots as colleagues, but as his <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. &#xF51;&#xF42;&#xF7A;&#xF0B;&#xF55;&#xFB2;&#xF74;&#xF42;] 1. Student. 2. Disciple. 3.

<p><strong>Q:</strong>  So the Rigdra was held once a year and the abbots [in the Riji] would do it by turns, right?   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  Yes. It was held in the 7th lunar month. Later, the Jiso was managed by the monastery itself (Tib. &#xF64;&#xF74;&#xF44;&#xF5B;&#xF72;&#xF53; [&#xF42;&#xF5E;&#xF74;&#xF44;&#xF0B;&#xF60;&#xF5B;&#xF72;&#xF53;]) [due to a new government reform rule] and we didn&apos;t need to send the abbot. All six abbots met and collected the income jointly and gave the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. &#xF42;&#xF4F;&#xF7C;&#xF44;&#xF0B;&#xF66;&#xF92;&#xF7C;] A monastic obligation to provide the food and other necessary items served at a monastic prayer assembly meeting or some other rite; this was often a required obligation for monastic officials at the end of their term of office.">tonggo</a> jointly. They set up in the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. &#xF62;&#xF74;&#xF44;&#xF0B;&#xF41;&#xF44;] A monastic kitchen.">rungkhang</a> and made it like permanent. The 6 <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. &#xF58;&#xF41;&#xF53;&#xF0B;&#xF54;&#xF7C;] Abbot of a monastery or monastic college.">khembo</a> set up 6 <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. &#xF55;&#xFB1;&#xF42;&#xF0B;&#xF58;&#xF5B;&#xF7C;&#xF51;] A senior manager/treasurer of an aristocratic or monastic estate, or the senior manager/treasurer of an aristocratic family or a monastic unit.

It was responsible for doing the 18 day Rigdra Ceremony for which it had estates to provide the funding.">Riji</a> have separate estates (ch&#xF6;shi) for giving the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. &#xF42;&#xF4F;&#xF7C;&#xF44;&#xF0B;&#xF66;&#xF92;&#xF7C;] A monastic obligation to provide the food and other necessary items served at a monastic prayer assembly meeting or some other rite; this was often a required obligation for monastic officials at the end of their term of office.">tonggo</a>?   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  Yes. In the Gyarpo [Tib. &#xF66;&#xF90;&#xFB1;&#xF62;&#xF0B;&#xF54;&#xF7C;] area, and in T&#xF6;lung and in Ngodrubding [Tib. &#xF51;&#xF44;&#xF7C;&#xF66;&#xF0B;&#xF42;&#xFB2;&#xF74;&#xF56;&#xF0B;&#xF63;&#xFA1;&#xF72;&#xF44;] they had estates and they collected a lot of grain.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  Did they have those estates from the time of Jayan Ch&#xF6;je?   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  Probably they did. They had hay, fodder, wheat, peas to collect and they didn&apos;t need to pay the water mill when milling <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. &#xF62;&#xFA9;&#xF58;&#xF0B;&#xF54;] The traditional Tibetan staple food that consists of grain that is roasted (popped), usually in sand, and then ground into a flour.">tsampa</a>.

<p><strong>Q:</strong>  How many days would they hold the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. &#xF62;&#xF72;&#xF42;&#xF66;&#xF0B;&#xF42;&#xFB2;&#xFAD;] The 18 day prayer meeting ceremony that was sponsored by the Riji Committee in Drepung Monastery.">rigdra</a>?   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  For 18 days. They also received salt and soda [Tib. &#xF56;&#xF74;&#xF63;&#xF0B;&#xF4F;&#xF7C;&#xF42;] from Northern Tibet which they would hand out during the rigdra. They also had to give <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. &#xF60;&#xF42;&#xFB1;&#xF7A;] Alms given to monks.">gye</a> as well as peaches and walnuts.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  Let&apos;s go back a little bit. After you returned to Gadong in the 5th month, what did you do?   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  I had to conclude my work, e.g., giving <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. &#xF42;&#xF4F;&#xF7C;&#xF44;&#xF0B;&#xF66;&#xF92;&#xF7C;] A monastic obligation to provide the food and other necessary items served at a monastic prayer assembly meeting or some other rite; this was often a required obligation for monastic officials at the end of their term of office.">tonggo</a>, etc. At the end of the 12th month, the Tsaja and Phuja officials [from Loseling] came there and took over the Phende [Tib. &#xF55;&#xF53;&#xF0B;&#xF56;&#xF51;&#xF7A;] Estate from me.   </p>

<p><strong>A:</strong>  Yes.

I was also told to go as the witness (Tib. &#xF59;&#xF72;&#xF54;&#xF44; [&#xF62;&#xFA9;&#xF72;&#xF66;&#xF0B;&#xF51;&#xF54;&#xF44;]) when they handed over Phende estate to the chabu.

When they said that I had to be there for about 8-9 days, I had to stay for 15-16 days. Although Gadong was quite good in that it had two estates, compared to Mesong, it was like a peddler selling small things and a humble household washing clothes. When they did the accounting by <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. &#xF62;&#xFA1;&#xF7A;&#xF60;&#xF74;] The traditional method of Tibetan arithmetic that uses a board and a variety of items like beans, sticks and stones.">diu</a> in a big room, there were so many items to account for like grain, butter, sheep, goat, lentils, wheat, yaks, etc, two people had to stand there to put the labels on different items.

<p><strong>Q:</strong>  Do you mean the number of <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. &#xF41;&#xF63;] A traditional volume measurement used for measuring grain in traditional Tibetan society.

There was also a factory where they did wool work, such as dying wool and weaving <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. &#xF66;&#xFA3;&#xF58;&#xF0B;&#xF56;&#xF74;] Hand-woven woolen fabric/material.">nambu</a>, rugs, aprons, the best quality nambu called shema [Tib. &#xF64;&#xF51;&#xF0B;&#xF58;], Tibetan woolen boots with leather soles (Tib. &#xF66;&#xF7C;&#xF58;&#xF54; [&#xF5F;&#xF7C;&#xF53;&#xF0B;&#xF54;]), monk&apos;s boots made from cotton that were worn by lamas and <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. &#xF62;&#xFA9;&#xF7A;&#xF0B;&#xF51;&#xFB2;&#xF74;&#xF44;] A monk official in the Tibetan government.">tsidrung</a> (Tib. &#xF62;&#xF7A;&#xF66;&#xF7C;&#xF58; [&#xF62;&#xF66;&#xF0B;&#xF5F;&#xF7C;&#xF53;]). Altogether, there were at least 70-80 people working in a house the size of <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. &#xF56;&#xF64;&#xF51;&#xF0B;&#xF66;&#xF92;&#xFB2;] The name of the family of an important lay aristocratic official.">Shatra</a>&apos;s House in Lhasa. When you went through the back door of the estate, you reached the factory. Otherwise, you wouldn&apos;t know that there was a factory there.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  How many stories did the house have?   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  It had three stories. The three estate stewards would stay in their rooms and come together when they met in the office (Tib. lhengye [&#xF63;&#xFB7;&#xF53;&#xF0B;&#xF62;&#xF92;&#xFB1;&#xF66;]). We drink tea in our <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. 1. &#xF64;&#xF42;, 2. &#xF5E;&#xF42;] 1. The apartment/room of a monk. 2. The butter fat that coagulates on the top of butter-tea when the tea is left to sit for some time. If the tea had been made with a lot of butter, this layer could be thick enough to scoop off and save to later sell or eat separately. The senior monks are usually served tea with a lot of shag.">shag</a> in the morning and the eat <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. &#xF66;&#xFA4;&#xF42;&#xF66;] A staple Tibetan dish of tsampa mixed with tea and kneaded into balls of dough-like consistency.">pag</a> in the office. It was the size of four pillars and had big windows. We ate in the office together and went to one&apos;s shag after work. When we look at Phende, Mesong seems to be a small and humble one (Tib. nyomchung [snyom chung].   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  Where is Phende located?   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  It is located on the left side of the Gyantse Serjog [Tib. &#xF66;&#xF7A;&#xF62;&#xF0B;&#xF63;&#xF95;&#xF7C;&#xF42;] Monastery. Serjog belonged to Taktra. At that time, Serjog&apos;s house was better than Phende&apos;s because Phende had yet to build the house. Phende had a good income and those <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. &#xF55;&#xFB1;&#xF42;&#xF0B;&#xF66;&#xFA6;&#xF74;&#xF42;] A manager (of estates and endowments) of a monastic college or monastic khamtsen.">chabu</a> became very rich. Gadong was really small compared to them.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  How many <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. &#xF41;&#xF63;] A traditional volume measurement used for measuring grain in traditional Tibetan society. Sizes of this unit varied somewhat, but the official government khe (called mkhar ru or bstan dzin mkha ru) weighed about 28-31 pounds for barley. It was used to convey the size of fields. For example, a field said to be 10 khe in size meant that 10 khe of seed could be sown on that field.">khe</a> of grain income did Gadong get?   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  When I handed over the grain including the grain loans, there was a little more than 70,000 <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. &#xF41;&#xF63;] A traditional volume measurement used for measuring grain in traditional Tibetan society.

We don&apos;t know how much because Gadong&apos;s documents were in your hands and we don&apos;t know about the income. At that time, I showed the grain and those things to the Tsaja and Phuja when they stayed in Gadong and settled some disputes.

They wanted me to be like the governor (jigyab) of all these estates.   </p>

<p><strong>A:</strong>  We got this also from Kapsh&#xF6;ba. After that I was sent as the representative to the Legj&#xF6; Office as the replacement of the ex-shengo because his eyesight was not good. They told me, &quot;If you don&apos;t want to go to Gadong, then you must go to the Legj&#xF6; Office because we have talked with the abbot.&quot; Then I said, &quot;You can&apos;t say that.&quot; Then I got the chance to come to India when the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. &#xF55;&#xFB1;&#xF42;&#xF0B;&#xF66;&#xFA6;&#xF74;&#xF42;] A manager (of estates and endowments) of a monastic college or monastic khamtsen.">chabu</a> were busy. I was left in Gadong because there were many troubles and they told me to be the witness when they were handing it over to the chabu and the monks also requested me to stay in Gadong. So when I left after the M&#xF6;nlam and went to <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. &#xF56;&#xF40;&#xFB2;&#xF0B;&#xF66;&#xF72;&#xF66;&#xF0B;&#xF63;&#xFB7;&#xF74;&#xF53;&#xF0B;&#xF54;&#xF7C;] The famous Gelugpa Monastery of the Panchen Lama located in Shigatse.">Tashilhunpo</a> for a pilgrimage, the revolt took place and all of my horses and the mules were robbed at the Jagsam Chuwori [Tib. lcahs zam chu bo ri] ferry site and I couldn&apos;t go back to the monastery. That&apos;s how I came to India.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  How did you leave Gadong when you came to India?   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  When I left Gadong, I had 36 horses and mules. They send one <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. &#xF63;&#xF42;] A traditional Tibetan unit comprising of ten transport animals. This term was normally used for mules and donkeys.">lag</a> [10 animals] of horses and mules from Lhasa and there was one lag in Mesong and I had one lag and I had 6 muleteers and there were also four of us.

There were also paper currency notes of 7-sang, 25-sang, and 10-sang denominations.">sang</a> sang.&quot; We reached Gyantse Phende at sunset and I stayed there for a few days. While there, I heard that the uprising had taken place in Lhasa, near Norbulinga. On the next day, when I watched from the big windows of Phende, I saw that they [Chinese] had set up cannons on the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. &#xF62;&#xFAB;&#xF7C;&#xF44;] A district in the traditional Tibetan governmental structure. This large administrative unit was headed by one or two district heads (tib. dzongp&#xF6;n [&#xF62;&#xFAB;&#xF7C;&#xF44;&#xF0B;&#xF51;&#xF54;&#xF7C;&#xF53;]) appointed by the Tibetan government. Typically there was one lay official and one monk official who were jointly sent from Lhasa for three year terms. They were responsible for collecting taxes and adjudicating disputes in their district. These dzong were equivalent to counties (ch. &#x53BF;) in the current Chinese system of administration.">dzong</a> targeting the monastery and they had hoisted about 4 flags. It was the time when the revolt was about to break out and all the people were planning to leave saying now the situation will not be good. Many of the servants of Phende were saying that first we must destroy the few pro-Chinese new lay officials [Tib. &#xF51;&#xFB2;&#xF74;&#xF44;&#xF0B;&#xF60;&#xF41;&#xF7C;&#xF62;&#xF0B;&#xF5E;&#xF56;&#xF66;&#xF0B;&#xF42;&#xF66;&#xF62;&#xF0B;&#xF56;]. So I didn&apos;t have any choice about what to do [Tib. &#xF42;&#xF0B;&#xF56;&#xFB1;&#xF7A;&#xF51;&#xF0B;&#xF60;&#xF51;&#xF72;&#xF0B;&#xF56;&#xFB1;&#xF7A;&#xF51;&#xF0B;&#xF58;&#xF72;&#xF0B;&#xF60;&#xF51;&#xF74;&#xF42;], because if I went through Dzara and Ralung, in Nangkartse there were Khambas, so I was [afraid] wondering what would happen [Tib. &#xF42;&#xF0B;&#xF60;&#xF51;&#xFB2;&#xF0B;&#xF56;&#xFB1;&#xF66;&#xF0B;&#xF61;&#xF7C;&#xF44;&#xF0B;&#xF56;&#xF66;&#xF58;] to me. In the Tratsang of the Shine [Tib. &#xF42;&#xF5E;&#xF72;&#xF0B;&#xF42;&#xF53;&#xF66;] Monastery, there was a Shungden [Tib. &#xF64;&#xF74;&#xF42;&#xF66;&#xF0B;&#xF63;&#xFA1;&#xF53;] [statue]. Someone told me to do <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. &#xF5F;&#xF53;&#xF0B;&#xF62;&#xF72;&#xF63;] A divine lottery. Multiple answers to a question were written on paper of the same size and rolled in dough balls of the same size and weight.

When I went through Ralung, I had to cross a mountain pass in the upper part of the valley of Khaka [Tib. &#xF58;&#xF41;&#xF62;&#xF0B;&#xF41;] and I stayed over night in Khaka which is the area where the aristocrats <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. &#xF40;&#xF0B;&#xF64;&#xF7C;&#xF51;&#xF0B;&#xF54;] A famous Tibetan aristocrat who was involved in many important political intrigues.">Kapsh&#xF6;ba</a>, Drangt&#xF6;ba [Tib. &#xF60;&#xF56;&#xFB2;&#xF44;&#xF0B;&#xF66;&#xF9F;&#xF7C;&#xF51;&#xF0B;&#xF54;] Samding [Tib. &#xF56;&#xF66;&#xF58;&#xF0B;&#xF63;&#xFA1;&#xF72;&#xF44;], Maya [Tib. &#xF62;&#xFA8;&#xF0B;&#xF56;&#xFB1;], Tara [Tib. &#xF62;&#xF9F;&#xF0B;&#xF62;] and Tangme [Tib. &#xF50;&#xF44;&#xF0B;&#xF66;&#xFA8;&#xF51;] were located and their <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. &#xF58;&#xF72;&#xF0B;&#xF66;&#xF7A;&#xF62;] A term that can mean serf/bound subject as well as citizen, depending on context.

Such headmen were responsible for organizing the different households to pay the village&apos;s taxes in-kind and labor.

In some areas they were elected by the village households, while in others the position was hereditary or appointed.">gembo</a> [for calling the miser to work for the tax].   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  Did that belong to Mesong?   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  That area belonged to Phende. Phende had a room, a storeroom and a kitchen in the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. &#xF62;&#xFAB;&#xF7C;&#xF44;] A district in the traditional Tibetan governmental structure.

Typically there was one lay official and one monk official who were jointly sent from Lhasa for three year terms. They were responsible for collecting taxes and adjudicating disputes in their district. These dzong were equivalent to counties (ch. &#x53BF;) in the current Chinese system of administration.">dzong</a>, so I went there and stayed overnight. On the next day, I passed the mountain pass and reached the place just before we reached the estate of Nara Kyishong [Tib. &#xF62;&#xFA3;&#xF0B;&#xF62;&#xF0B;&#xF66;&#xF90;&#xFB1;&#xF72;&#xF51;&#xF0B;&#xF42;&#xF64;&#xF7C;&#xF44;].   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  There was a very big house there, right?   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  Yes. There were some travelers who went to Lhasa to see the M&#xF6;nlam and came back and among them there was an old man with a cane. I had put the letters Dre Loling <a href="Abbr.%20of%20Drepung%20%3Ca%20href=%22#%22%20data-tooltip=%22[tib.%20&#xF56;&#xFB3;&#xF7C;&#xF0B;&#xF42;&#xF66;&#xF63;&#xF0B;&#xF42;&#xFB3;&#xF72;&#xF44;]%20One%20of%20the%20main%20colleges%20in%20Drepung%20Monastery.%22%3ELoseling%3C/a">Tib. &#xF60;&#xF56;&#xFB2;&#xF66;&#xF0B;&#xF56;&#xFB3;&#xF7C;&#xF0B;&#xF63;&#xF72;&#xF44;</a> on my leading mule (Tib. &#xF64;&#xF7C;&#xF4F;&#xFB2;&#xF7A; [&#xF64;&#xF7C;&#xF0B;&#xF51;&#xFB2;&#xF7A;&#xF63;].

Some were reading the Gesar Story and some were playing mahjong making the sound &quot;ta ta ta.&quot; I heard that they had tied two Bodyguard Regiment soldiers to pillars because they had said that <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. &#xF53;&#xF7C;&#xF62;&#xF0B;&#xF56;&#xF74;&#xF0B;&#xF42;&#xFB3;&#xF72;&#xF44;&#xF0B;&#xF41;] The summer palace of the Dalai Lama.">Norbulinga</a> had been lost. Then they [Chushigandru] said, &quot;Norbulinga was not lost. The two soldiers are Chinese spies so we must kill them.&quot; The soldiers had told them the truth. I heard that they were about to whip them [Tib. &#xF62;&#xF9F;&#xF0B;&#xF63;&#xF95;&#xF42;&#xF0B;&#xF42;&#xF5E;&#xF74;&#xF0B;&#xF42;&#xFB2;&#xF56;&#xF66;&#xF0B;&#xF60;&#xF51;&#xF74;&#xF42;], but I didn&apos;t see them doing the whipping.&quot; When I went to get a pass, they said that they have to ask their commander and there were two guards carrying guns. They said that they will make a report. I had taken a <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. &#xF41;&#xF0B;&#xF56;&#xF4F;&#xF42;&#xF66;] A Tibetan ceremonial scarf given to lamas, visitors, etc.">khata</a> scarf and I was going to give it to him. I was wondering what kind of commander he would be, but I found that he was the Phara <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. &#xF41;&#xF58;&#xF66;&#xF0B;&#xF54;] A person from the Kham region, a Tibetan from the Khamba (Khampa) sub-cultural group.">Khamba</a> who had a goiter.

It&apos;s you, mister <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. &#xF51;&#xF42;&#xF7A;&#xF0B;&#xF66;&#xF90;&#xF7C;&#xF66;] The main disciplinary official in a monastic college (tratsang).">geg&#xF6;</a> la. Please come in.&quot; He was like embarrassed and I was too. The servants were looking at us with surprise. Then he insisted that I sit at the head and he served me tea. He said, &quot;Are you going up tomorrow? I said yes and in the morning when I climbed up the mountain, there were many monks coming also and among them there was Panglung Rimpoche [Tib. &#xF66;&#xFA4;&#xF44;&#xF0B;&#xF63;&#xF74;&#xF44;&#xF0B;&#xF62;&#xF72;&#xF53;&#xF0B;&#xF54;&#xF7C;&#xF0B;&#xF46;&#xF7A;] and his relative, Lady Drekhang. She was telling the others, &quot;Isn&apos;t that Urgyen.&quot; They said the Dalai Lama had left for India and the revolt had taken place and Norbulinga was lost, and many thousands of monks are coming from Drepung like a religious procession (sebang).&quot; She was crying and I also burst into tears. When we started to climb up the mountain, the horses and mules had already reached half way up the pass, so when I got to the top, the horses and the mules had descended from the pass. Then we boiled tea and drank one or two of cups of tea. Then a lot of Khambas came saying, &quot;aro aro&quot; [Tib. &#xF68;&#xF0B;&#xF62;&#xF7C;&#xF42;&#xF66;] [the way Khambas call people in an impolite way] and they took all of my horses and the mules and they also tore open the loads and even came to shoot me saying, &quot;You! We have come serving the Dalai Lama&quot; [Tib. &#xF41;&#xF7C;&#xF0B;&#xF62;&#xF7A;&#xF0D; &#xF44;&#xF0B;&#xF5A;&#xF7C;&#xF0B;&#xF62;&#xF92;&#xFB1;&#xF63;&#xF0B;&#xF56;&#xF0B;&#xF62;&#xF72;&#xF53;&#xF0B;&#xF54;&#xF7C;&#xF0B;&#xF46;&#xF7A;&#xF0B;&#xF5E;&#xF56;&#xF66;&#xF0B;&#xF55;&#xFB1;&#xF72;&#xF0B;&#xF5E;&#xF74;&#xF66;&#xF0B;&#xF53;&#xF66;&#xF0B;&#xF61;&#xF7C;&#xF44;&#xF0B;&#xF56;&#xF0B;&#xF61;&#xF72;&#xF53;] and they were also trying to whip us and hit us with their swords, but they didn&apos;t. They took my good black mule with white around it&apos;s eyes [Tib. &#xF51;&#xFB2;&#xF7A;&#xF63;&#xF0B;&#xF62;&#xF92;&#xFB1;&#xF0B;&#xF58;&#xF7C;]. They left only two worse ones; a small grey mule and a small red horse and they also beat the muleteer when he didn&apos;t let them take the horse and mules. That&apos;s it. On that day, we remained there feeling sad and the next morning I told them to hire two horses. I sent my servant and the muleteer to Gongkar [Tib. &#xF42;&#xF7C;&#xF44;&#xF0B;&#xF51;&#xF40;&#xF62;] and told them that the Gadong abbot might come there, so tell him what happened here and also see whether or not someone has come from my shag. After those two left, the next morning, they came back and said that it has been about 1 day since the abbot and all of them had left. The monastery was packed with monks, but there was nobody from my shag. They met Nyagre Khentr&#xFC; and the ex-shengo on the back side of the mountain pass and they asked where I was and Nyagre Khentr&#xFC; said that he was going to wait for me. On the next day, I loaded up the horse and the mule with the things and I went walking. After sunset, when it was almost dark, again someone was saying, &quot;aro aro&quot; and he cursed me saying, &quot;Your parent&apos;s corpse [Tib. &#xF55;&#xF0B;&#xF62;&#xF7C;&#xF0B;&#xF58;&#xF0B;&#xF62;&#xF7C;] your mule is here.&quot; The mule was a very tranquil one, but she became like mad and bit the pillar and climbed up the trough. So she got beaten and there were lot of sores on her body and the bell was also smashed.&quot; At that time, the mule was crying and saying &quot;&#xF6; &#xF6;.&quot; From the next morning, I rode the mule and she brought me up to Bomdila in India where I sold the mule with the saddlery for 200 <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. &#xF4F;&#xF58;&#xF0B;&#xF40;] A unit in the traditional Tibetan currency system that was equal to 4 sang. Also a silver coin.">trangga</a> garpo. I gave the grey horse to a household. Nyagre Khentr&#xFC; and I were together when we came from Tibet. Then when we reached Missamari and I met you <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. &#xF66;&#xF90;&#xF74;&#xF0B;&#xF44;&#xF7C;] An honorific term of address for aristocratic officials. It is something like, &quot;Your Excellency.&quot;">kung&#xF6;</a>, right?   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  Yes.   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  I stayed 25 days in Missamari and then I was sent to the Old People Home in Dalhousie. And then the Dalai Lama, Chemmo and Liushar [Tib. &#xF66;&#xFA3;&#xF7A;&#xF68;&#xF74;&#xF0B;&#xF64;&#xF62;] came and I was called and I went to Simla. That&apos;s all.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  What did you do in Missamari?   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  I just stayed idle. On the day we reached Dalhousie, there were two vehicles and there was a staff person from <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. &#xF40;&#xF74;&#xF53;&#xF0B;&#xF56;&#xF51;&#xF7A;&#xF0B;&#xF42;&#xFB3;&#xF72;&#xF44;] 1. A famous incarnate lama whose lineage served as Regent of Tibet. The Lhasa monastery of Kundeling Rimpoche.">Kundeling</a> and there was one person called Trago Sahib who spoke some Tibetan who asked my name. I told him my names and he made a note and he said I need only one name. Then they took us to the hotel and we ate food until we were full and then they took us to the house called Ramasha. On the next day, many Indians came and gave mugs and cooking utensils and rice and Trago Sahib handed all the cooking utensils over to me. There were about 60 people and they gave us all salary and things like meat and fuel also. Then I became the gyagp&#xF6;n. When the Dalai Lama came, you <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. &#xF66;&#xF90;&#xF74;&#xF0B;&#xF44;&#xF7C;] An honorific term of address for aristocratic officials. It is something like, &quot;Your Excellency.&quot;">kung&#xF6;</a> were there, right?   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  Yes.   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  And then we all reported to the Kashag to appoint a government official to watch over the salary. Liushar said. &quot;Do you need a government official on top of a government official? Anyway, the Kashag will consult on this because it is your request.&quot; I was the one who first put forward that suggestion and it became like the proverb, &quot;Catch me and pull off my hairs.&quot; [Tib. &#xF44;&#xF0B;&#xF5F;&#xF72;&#xF53;&#xF0B;&#xF53;&#xF66;&#xF0B;&#xF66;&#xFA4;&#xF74;&#xF0B;&#xF50;&#xF7C;&#xF42;&#xF66;]. Later, Tsidrung Ch&#xF6;mpel D&#xF6;nden [Tib. &#xF46;&#xF7C;&#xF66;&#xF0B;&#xF60;&#xF55;&#xF7A;&#xF63;&#xF0B;&#xF51;&#xF7C;&#xF53;&#xF0B;&#xF63;&#xFA1;&#xF53;] and I were appointed to watch over the salary. [talks in detail about getting appointed as the head of the settlements in Simla and Bomdila and how finally he got retirement salary from the exile government and got admitted into the Old People&apos;s Home in Kalimpong] When I was in Penam Gadong, I asked for leave from being in charge of Gadong, but it was not granted. The protective deity of Gadong was Shri Devi [Tib. &#xF63;&#xFB7;&#xF0B;&#xF58;&#xF7C;] and I did a <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. &#xF5F;&#xF53;&#xF0B;&#xF62;&#xF72;&#xF63;] A divine lottery. Multiple answers to a question were written on paper of the same size and rolled in dough balls of the same size and weight. These were shaken in a plate or bowl in front of a statue of a deity until one of the balls popped out. The ball that popped out was considered to have been selected by the deity before which the lottery was done.">senriy</a> in front of Lhamo, but the senriy didn&apos;t come out in favor of asking for leave. Then I did a senriy in front of protective deity Mahakala [Tib. &#xF58;&#xF42;&#xF7C;&#xF53;&#xF0B;&#xF54;&#xF7C;] and still it didn&apos;t come favor of asking leave and I then I did a senriy in front of protective deity Jamsing [Tib. &#xF63;&#xF95;&#xF58;&#xF0B;&#xF66;&#xFB2;&#xF72;&#xF44;] and still it didn&apos;t come favor of my asking leave. The abbot told me that if I am going to ask for leave, I have to ask <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. &#xF42;&#xF53;&#xF66;&#xF0B;&#xF46;&#xF74;&#xF44;] 1. One of the main protector deities of the Tibetan government and the Dalai Lama. 2. The monastery in which the medium of Nechung resides that is located just east of Drepung Monastery.">Nechung</a> and Gadong for their prophecies and if they tell you to ask for leave, then we will consult. Even if we grant your leave, you have to take the responsibility. Then I asked Tema [Tib. &#xF56;&#xF66;&#xF9F;&#xF53;&#xF0B;&#xF58;] for the prophecy and Tema said, &quot;It is good for you to stay&quot;.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  If you had gone back to Drepung, you might not have been able to come to India, right?   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  Yes. I also asked Gadong deity for a prophecy and he also said, &quot;It is good for you to stay.&quot; At that time, <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. &#xF42;&#xF53;&#xF66;&#xF0B;&#xF46;&#xF74;&#xF44;] 1. One of the main protector deities of the Tibetan government and the Dalai Lama. 2. The monastery in which the medium of Nechung resides that is located just east of Drepung Monastery.">Nechung</a> oracle had been to India and had not come back. Later I heard that they were summoning Nechung to come into trance and when I went there the place was packed with monks. I had brought the request for a prophecy but I couldn&apos;t deliver it right way because it was my turn to go for the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. &#xF5E;&#xF63;&#xF0B;&#xF44;&#xF7C;] 1. A junior officer in the traditional Tibetan Army in charge of a unit (platoon) of 25 soldiers (same as dingp&#xF6;n). 2. The two head disciplinary officials for all of Drepung Monastery and for the M&#xF6;nlam Prayer Festival.">Shengo</a> candidate. If I had become a shengo, it would have been in 1959. So I thought the monks would think that I want to be one of the Shengo candidates. Then I asked the clerk to deliver my request for a prophecy and the prophecy was given. When I went to get the answer, it also said, &quot;It is good for you to stay.&quot; Therefore, I had to go back to Gadong so because of that I could come to India. Otherwise, if a leave was granted and I came back to Drepung, they wouldn&apos;t let me go and they would have appointed me as representative in <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. &#xF53;&#xF7C;&#xF62;&#xF0B;&#xF56;&#xF74;&#xF0B;&#xF42;&#xFB3;&#xF72;&#xF44;&#xF0B;&#xF41;] The summer palace of the Dalai Lama.">Norbulinga</a>, the Potala or <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. &#xF5E;&#xF7C;&#xF63;] The walled town beneath the Potala Palace in Lhasa.">Sh&#xF6;l</a> Parkhang [Tib. &#xF5E;&#xF7C;&#xF63;&#xF0B;&#xF54;&#xF62;&#xF0B;&#xF41;&#xF44;] and then I would have been caught. But I didn&apos;t need to suffer that. So this is my story.   </p>
