**Q:**  It is 10. 9. 1983, Sunday at 9.10 a.m. As Gelek Rimpoche has introduced me to you, there are lot of things I would like to ask you about your whole life story. When I was a child, you, Chagdampa Urgyen la, were very famous in Loseling. You had rich experiences. How many years did you serve as Chagdampa?   

**A:**  For 9 years.   

**Q:**  Did you serve continuously?   

**A:**  During the Reting regency I did it for 4 years.   

**Q:**  You were appointed during the Reting regency, right?   

**A:**  Yes. Then I stopped doing it for 5 years. Then I worked as Nyert<a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. སྲང] A unit of traditional Tibetan currency. It was also called ngüsang [tib. དངུལ་སྲང]. 50 nügsang = 1 dotse; 10 sho = 1 nügsang; 20 5-karma coins = 1 ngüsang. There were also paper currency notes of 7-sang, 25-sang, and 10-sang denominations.">sang</a> for 10 months. After doing that, I worked on the staff of the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཚོགས་མཆོད] The large religious prayer festival held in Lhasa in the 2nd Tibetan lunar month.">Tsongjö</a> Sebang [Tib. ཚོགས་མཆོད་སེར་སྦྲེང]. In the 8th month, I invited the lama [unclear]. When the old <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཞལ་ངོ] 1. A junior officer in the traditional Tibetan Army in charge of a unit (platoon) of 25 soldiers (same as dingpön). 2. The two head disciplinary officials for all of Drepung Monastery and for the Mönlam Prayer Festival.">Shengo</a> finished his term at the end of the 6th month, the new Shengo came and I gave the Shengo 3 sang and a <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཁ་བཏགས] A Tibetan ceremonial scarf given to lamas, visitors, etc.">khata</a> scarf called ashe as a gift (Tib. གྱབདེན) when I asked him for the Chagdampa position. The Shengo would make notes of the people who were asking to get appointed as the Chagdampa and <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཤིང་གཉེར] The monk in charge of firewood at the Mönlam Prayer Festival.">Shingnyer</a> positions and they would report these to the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཡིག་ཚང] The highest office dealing with monastic and religious affairs in the traditional Tibetan government. It is often called the Ecclesiastic Office. It was headed by 4 fourth rank monk officials called Trunyichemmo. The senior Trunyichemmo was called Ta Lama.">Yigtsang</a> Office and the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. དྲུང་ཡིག་ཆེན་མོ] The title of the four heads of the Yigtsang Office (Ecclesiastics Office).">drunyichemmo</a> [who headed that office] would do the decision [unclear]. I was in <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. བློ་གསལ་གླིང] One of the main colleges in Drepung Monastery.">Loseling</a> College. I also went to the Yigtsang Office [unclear]. I knew all of them and I asked them how many people were asking to be appointed Chagdampa. They said there were 11 people. [unclear]   

**Q:**  What month was that?   

**A:**  It was in the 8th lunar month. I heard that the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. དྲུང་ཡིག་ཆེན་མོ] The title of the four heads of the Yigtsang Office (Ecclesiastics Office).">drunyichemmo</a> were asking whether I was staying here [in Lhasa], and where was I staying and what work did I have. [unclear]   

**Q:**  Who said that?   

**A:**  The secretariat of <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཡིག་ཚང] The highest office dealing with monastic and religious affairs in the traditional Tibetan government. It is often called the Ecclesiastic Office. It was headed by 4 fourth rank monk officials called Trunyichemmo. The senior Trunyichemmo was called Ta Lama.">Yigtsang</a>. The Yigtsang Nyerpa told me this and he said that he told the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. དྲུང་ཡིག་ཆེན་མོ] The title of the four heads of the Yigtsang Office (Ecclesiastics Office).">drunyichemmo</a> that I don't have work. From Drepung, he [? unclear] went to Sera on the 6th of the 9th month. Then I heard on the 6th [day] they received a letter calling the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. མཁན་པོ] Abbot of a monastery or monastic college.">khembo</a>, etc. to come to the Yigtsang Office. On the 7th when I went to the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཞལ་ངོ] 1. A junior officer in the traditional Tibetan Army in charge of a unit (platoon) of 25 soldiers (same as dingpön). 2. The two head disciplinary officials for all of Drepung Monastery and for the Mönlam Prayer Festival.">Shengo</a>'s office, the senior Shengo told me to sit down and have tea --it was like the saying, "Do not discuss things while your mouth is empty." [Tib. ཁ་སྟོང་པ་ལ་གྲོས་མ་བྱེད]. He then told me to read the letter which said, "The representatives of the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. བླ་སྤྱི] The highest administrative council in large monasteries, like Drepung. It consisted of the Abbots, the Tshogchen Umdze, the Shengo and the Jiso. In Drepung it also included ex-abbots.">Laji</a>'s khembo who acted rashly and the khembo of the two <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. གྲྭ་ཚང] A &quot;college&quot; within a monastery, for example, in Drepung Monastery there were four main tratsang: Gomang, Loseling, Deyang and Ngagpa. These tratsang were property owning corporate entities and included monks who were organized into residential dormitories called Khamtsen.">tratsang</a> [involved] must come to the Yigtsang." [Tib. བླ་སྤྱིའི་མཁན་འཐུས་དོན་མ་གོ་དང། གྲྭ་ཚང་གཉིས་ཀྱི་མཁན་པོ་ཡིག་ཚང་དུ་བཅར་དགོས]. The <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. བློ་གསལ་གླིང] One of the main colleges in Drepung Monastery.">Loseling</a> Khembo asked me, "This is strange. I wonder what it could be. Was there any trouble in the past? [Tib. ཨ་ཡ་མཚན། གང་ཡིན་ན། སྔོན་མའི་རྙོག་དྲ་འདྲ་ཡོད་རེད་པས]. I said, "The trouble in the past was like the proverb, "The horse had run and the dust was cleared." [Tib. རྟ་རྒྱུགས་རྡུལ་ཡལ]. The Loseling Khembo then asked me whether I had a horse and I said yes. I had a red horse that was saddled. And Chönzin la [Tib. ཆོས་འཛིན་ལགས] [the Shingnyer] also had a horse. The Khembo told me, "The Tibetan government's <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. སྐུ་དྲག] 1. A member of the lay aristocracy. 2. Title for government lay and monk officials. 3. A name occasionally used for the top leaders/officials in a monastery.">kudrak</a> are malicious/bad [Tib. ངན་པོ] so you should be careful and should propitiate the deities [Tib. འཕྲིན་བཅོལ]." When we went via Parikhug [Tib. བྲག་རི་ཁུག], the three khembo were also going there. And then we were called into the Yigtsang Office.  

**Q:**  What time was that?   

**A:**  It was around 10 a.m. At this time the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཡིག་ཚང] The highest office dealing with monastic and religious affairs in the traditional Tibetan government. It is often called the Ecclesiastic Office. It was headed by 4 fourth rank monk officials called Trunyichemmo. The senior Trunyichemmo was called Ta Lama.">Yigtsang</a>'s <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. དྲུང་ཡིག་ཆེན་མོ] The title of the four heads of the Yigtsang Office (Ecclesiastics Office).">drunyichemmo</a> were <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. རམ་པ] The family name of a well known aristocratic monk official who was a Kalön.">Rampa</a>, Jawdang [Tib. ལྕོག་སྟེང] and Bumtang [Tib. འབུམ་ཐང]. I don't remember the other one.   

**Q:**  One <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. དྲུང་ཡིག་ཆེན་མོ] The title of the four heads of the Yigtsang Office (Ecclesiastics Office).">drunyichemmo</a> might have been Lheding [Tib. ལྷ་ལྡིང], right?   

**A:**  Probably. <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. རམ་པ] The family name of a well known aristocratic monk official who was a Kalön.">Rampa</a> and Bumtang were telling each other, "You give the order." Then Jawdang told Bumtang to give the order and Bumtang gave the order saying, "The two <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཞལ་ངོ] 1. A junior officer in the traditional Tibetan Army in charge of a unit (platoon) of 25 soldiers (same as dingpön). 2. The two head disciplinary officials for all of Drepung Monastery and for the Mönlam Prayer Festival.">Shengo</a>, the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. མཁན་པོ] Abbot of a monastery or monastic college.">khembo</a> of the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. བླ་སྤྱི] The highest administrative council in large monasteries, like Drepung. It consisted of the Abbots, the Tshogchen Umdze, the Shengo and the Jiso. In Drepung it also included ex-abbots.">Laji</a>, the khembo of the two <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. གྲྭ་ཚང] A &quot;college&quot; within a monastery, for example, in Drepung Monastery there were four main tratsang: Gomang, Loseling, Deyang and Ngagpa. These tratsang were property owning corporate entities and included monks who were organized into residential dormitories called Khamtsen.">tratsang</a>, the Chagdampa Urgyen and the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. སྒོ་མང] One of the large colleges in Drepung Monastery.">Gomang</a> <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཤིང་གཉེར] The monk in charge of firewood at the Mönlam Prayer Festival.">Shingnyer</a> Chönzin must listen carefully." That year was the Water-Horse year, the year in which the Dalai Lama held his first ceremony in the 7th lunar month. [unclear] The order said, "Chagdampa Urgyen and Shingnyer Chönzin are appointed to serve as the Chagdampa and the Shingnyer as before. The two Shengo must not think that you are above them and will use your power over them. You have to consult with them. It is like the saying, "If you are not auspicious inside, you cannot accomplish your work outside." [Tib. ནང་བཀྲ་མ་ཤིས་ན། ཕྱི་དོན་མི་འགྲུབ]. You the Chagdampa must do your best. If you do that, it will be good and the higher ups will also not need to hear any troubles [Tib. སྙན་འཇམ་པོ] and you will have tranquility [Tib. འཇམ་པོ]. If you do that, it will be like the Tsogchen Shengo giving the speech, "To have a mild dream when sleeping and become like day break when we wake up." [Tib. གཉིད་ཁུག་ནས་རྨི་ལམ་འཇམ་པ། ཡར་སད་ནས་ནམ་ལངས་པ]. Also, the Chagdampa must hand over all the gifts called büthob [Tib. འབུལ་ཐོབ] to the Shengo because the Shengo have to give many <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. གཏོང་སྒོ] A monastic obligation to provide the food and other necessary items served at a monastic prayer assembly meeting or some other rite; this was often a required obligation for monastic officials at the end of their term of office.">tonggo</a> using these. And you are not allowed to receive newly created extra things [Tib. སྔར་མེད་གསར་སྤྲོས]. The two of you have to do your work not worse than before, even if you can't do it better than before. And do not forget my words as soon as you get out the door". [unclear]".   

**Q:**  Didn't the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. དྲུང་ཡིག་ཆེན་མོ] The title of the four heads of the Yigtsang Office (Ecclesiastics Office).">drunyichemmo</a> say any other things?   

**A:**  No, and we told them that we will do whatever they tell us to do.   

**Q:**  Who was the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. མཁན་པོ] Abbot of a monastery or monastic college.">khembo</a> then?   

**A:**  It was the late Ngagpa Khembo Shenyen Tsündrü La [Tib. བཤེས་གཉེན་བརྩོན་འགྲུས་ལགས].   

**Q:**  Didn't he become a <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཞལ་ངོ] 1. A junior officer in the traditional Tibetan Army in charge of a unit (platoon) of 25 soldiers (same as dingpön). 2. The two head disciplinary officials for all of Drepung Monastery and for the Mönlam Prayer Festival.">Shengo</a> in the past?   

**A:**  No. He worked as the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཤིང་གཉེར] The monk in charge of firewood at the Mönlam Prayer Festival.">Shingnyer</a> for 9 years. The <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. སྒོ་མང] One of the large colleges in Drepung Monastery.">Gomang</a> Khembo was Chömpel Gyentsen La [Tib. ཆོས་འཕེལ་རྒྱལ་མཚན་ལགས]   

**Q:**  Where was he from?   

**A:**  He was from Central Tibet [Tib. üཙང]. The <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. བློ་གསལ་གླིང] One of the main colleges in Drepung Monastery.">Loseling</a> Khembo was Yeshe Jimpa [Tib. ཡེ་ཤེས་སྦྱིན་པ] from <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. གཙང་པ] 1. A person from Tsang. 2. A khamtsen in Loseling College.">Tsangpa</a> Khamtsen who was from Drongsar [Tib. གྲོང་གསར] which is located near Lhasa. The Ngagpa Khembo was Ngawang Gyatso [Tib. ངག་དབང་རྒྱ་མཚོ]. He was the tall, fat and bald one.   

**Q:**  What is the full name of the Chönzin La?   

**A:**  His name is Lobsang Jimpa [Tib. བློ་བཟང་སྦྱིན་པ].   

**Q:**  What is your name?   

**A:**  My name is Thubden Legshey [Tib. ཐུབ་བསྟན་ལེགས་བཤད].   

**Q:**  Your real name is Thubden Legshey [Tib. ཐུབ་བསྟན་ལེགས་བཤད], right?   

**A:**  Yes, but nobody calls me Thubden Legshey.   

**Q:**  Why were you called Urgyen la?   

**A:**  My name Urgyen was given by my father who was named Jambey Gyentsen [Tib. འཇམ་དཔལ་རྒྱལ་མཚན]. He was a Chanang. In the monastery, I became the Gegö for 7 years. In the charter list for getting alms (gye [Tib. འགྱེད་གཏོང་རྩ་ཚིག]), my name was written Tsha [Tib. ཚ་བ] Khamtsen Thubden Legshey, so they didn't know who that was. When they asked the Khamtsen, they said there wasn't a person called Thubden Legshey.   

**Q:**  What happened after you received the order?   

**A:**  Then when we came out from the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཡིག་ཚང] The highest office dealing with monastic and religious affairs in the traditional Tibetan government. It is often called the Ecclesiastic Office. It was headed by 4 fourth rank monk officials called Trunyichemmo. The senior Trunyichemmo was called Ta Lama.">Yigtsang</a> and went to <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. གནས་ཆུང] 1. One of the main protector deities of the Tibetan government and the Dalai Lama. 2. The monastery in which the medium of Nechung resides that is located just east of Drepung Monastery.">Nechung</a> monastery where they served us noodles for lunch. The Khembo Yeshe Jimpa was already there and they had heard about the order and congratulated us and said now it is good. This was because when I was Chagdampa, I never beat people except sometimes in the office I would beat people a little bit when something went wrong. Then I went to <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. སེ་ར་བྱེས] The Jey (Je) College of Sera Monastery.">Sera Jey</a> and they served me noodles and then I went to <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. སེ་ར་སྨད] The Mey (Me) College of Sera Monastery.">Sera Mey</a> where I knew many people like Trijang Labrang's Chandzö, etc. and they also served me noodles. Then I went to Ngagpa College where they also served me noodles, but I couldn't eat it. Then I went to Shedrubling [Tib. བཤད་སྒྲུབ་གླིང] where they served me rice mixed with melted butter and yogurt (Tib. ཤོམདྲེ [ཞོ་འབྲས]). After that, I went to the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. བླ་སྤྱི] The highest administrative council in large monasteries, like Drepung. It consisted of the Abbots, the Tshogchen Umdze, the Shengo and the Jiso. In Drepung it also included ex-abbots.">Laji</a> where many people from my <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ལྟོ་ཚང] 1. The club of the Dobdos. 2. A group of people eating together.">tobtsang</a> came to congratulate me. There were more people coming to congratulate me than the Khembo and the Shengo.   

**Q:**  When you came back to the monastery, what did they talk about? Were they surprised?   

**A:**  Yes. They were all saying that this is really good news. When I came back to the monastery, the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. བློ་གསལ་གླིང] One of the main colleges in Drepung Monastery.">Loseling</a> Khembo said, "I thought you and <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཤིང་གཉེར] The monk in charge of firewood at the Mönlam Prayer Festival.">Shingnyer</a> Chönzin La probably might not be appointed again, especially because you have something pending from the past [Tib. ཤུལ]."   

**Q:**  Did he mean because you killed the thief named Gangtsug [Tib. རྐང་བཙུག]?   

**A:**  Yes. I told him that this case was settled and they had already issued the verdict. Then I went to the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཞལ་ངོ] 1. A junior officer in the traditional Tibetan Army in charge of a unit (platoon) of 25 soldiers (same as dingpön). 2. The two head disciplinary officials for all of Drepung Monastery and for the Mönlam Prayer Festival.">Shengo</a>'s office and the new senior Shengo told me, "Now it is good that we can sit on the same cushion and work together . I will not make a big deal about it [Tib. ངོ་སོ་མེད་ད]." [unclear].   

**Q:**  What was the name of the senior <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཞལ་ངོ] 1. A junior officer in the traditional Tibetan Army in charge of a unit (platoon) of 25 soldiers (same as dingpön). 2. The two head disciplinary officials for all of Drepung Monastery and for the Mönlam Prayer Festival.">Shengo</a>?   

**A:**  His name was Yeshe Gyentsen [Tib. ཡེ་ཤེས་རྒྱལ་མཚན]. He was from Ütö [Tib. དབུས་སྟོད] (the upper part of Central Tibet).   

**Q:**  What was the name of the junior <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཞལ་ངོ] 1. A junior officer in the traditional Tibetan Army in charge of a unit (platoon) of 25 soldiers (same as dingpön). 2. The two head disciplinary officials for all of Drepung Monastery and for the Mönlam Prayer Festival.">Shengo</a>?   

**A:**  His name was Jimpa Khechog [Tib. སྦྱིན་པ་མཁས་མཆོག]. He was from <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. སྒོ་མང] One of the large colleges in Drepung Monastery.">Gomang</a> College and his home was Gyarpo [Tib. སྐྱར་པོ]. [unclear]   

**Q:**  What did <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཤིང་གཉེར] The monk in charge of firewood at the Mönlam Prayer Festival.">Shingnyer</a> Chönzin La say?   

**A:**  He said, "Now I have to work with you and it is like the saying, "Looking at the bad omen again and smelling the odor again." [Tib. ལྟས་ངན་ལ་ལྟ་སྐྱོར་དང་དྲི་ངན་ལ་སྣོམ་སྐྱོར]. I feel annoyed like it is becoming dark [Tib. ཅ་མ་ཟིང། ས་རུབ་པ་ལྟ་བུ] when I have to work with you." I said, "We don't need to work together. We have separate duties." Then I didn't talk with him.   

**Q:**  Did he say that as if he was kidding?   

**A:**  Yes. He was kidding. We paid 30 <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. རྡོ་ཚད] A currency unit in traditional Tibet that was equal to 50 ngüsang.">dotse</a> to the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཞལ་ངོ] 1. A junior officer in the traditional Tibetan Army in charge of a unit (platoon) of 25 soldiers (same as dingpön). 2. The two head disciplinary officials for all of Drepung Monastery and for the Mönlam Prayer Festival.">Shengo</a> for the büthob (gift) which we had to pay, but we also paid 125 dotse as a donation for the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. གཏོང་སྒོ] A monastic obligation to provide the food and other necessary items served at a monastic prayer assembly meeting or some other rite; this was often a required obligation for monastic officials at the end of their term of office.">tonggo</a> which was extra, so Chönzin La and I had to suffer this loss.   

**Q:**  When they gave you the order [in the Yigtsang] were the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཞལ་ངོ] 1. A junior officer in the traditional Tibetan Army in charge of a unit (platoon) of 25 soldiers (same as dingpön). 2. The two head disciplinary officials for all of Drepung Monastery and for the Mönlam Prayer Festival.">Shengo</a> present?   

**A:**  Yes.   

**Q:**  So at that time, there were 7 people, right?   

**A:**  Yes.   

**Q:**  What did you tell the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཞང་གོ་ཤིང་གཉེར] The monastic official in charge of fuel for the Great Prayer Festival in Lhasa (the Mönlam).">Shanggo shingnyer</a> and such people?   

**A:**  I told the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཞང་གོ་ཤིང་གཉེར] The monastic official in charge of fuel for the Great Prayer Festival in Lhasa (the Mönlam).">Shanggo shingnyer</a>, "The lords and lamas gave the order, but for me it was like the saying, "Even if your feet hot and don't want to, you have to sun bathe." [Tib. མ་འདོད་ཚ་བ་འཚིགས་ཀྱང། ཉི་མ་སྲོ་དགོས་ཤར་བ་རེད]. I also don't want to work with you." So the junior <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཞལ་ངོ] 1. A junior officer in the traditional Tibetan Army in charge of a unit (platoon) of 25 soldiers (same as dingpön). 2. The two head disciplinary officials for all of Drepung Monastery and for the Mönlam Prayer Festival.">Shengo</a> said, "What's the matter?" I said, "He is very proud. [Tib. ལྟ་བ་མཐོ་པོ], but I will never ask him to help me even for five karma." Then we went to the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. བླ་སྤྱི] The highest administrative council in large monasteries, like Drepung. It consisted of the Abbots, the Tshogchen Umdze, the Shengo and the Jiso. In Drepung it also included ex-abbots.">Laji</a> and the Khembo tripa was there and we reported how the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཡིག་ཚང] The highest office dealing with monastic and religious affairs in the traditional Tibetan government. It is often called the Ecclesiastic Office. It was headed by 4 fourth rank monk officials called Trunyichemmo. The senior Trunyichemmo was called Ta Lama.">Yigtsang</a> gave the order and about the instructions.   

**Q:**  Who was the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. མཁན་པོ་ཁྲི་པ] The most senior abbot in a committee of abbots such as the Laji.">khembo tripa</a>?   

**A:**  He was from Gya Khamtsen so he was called Gyapa Khembo Lobsang Jungne La [Tib. རྒྱ་པ་མཁན་པོ་བློ་བཟང་འབྱུང་གནས]. He said, "It is very good. It is unprecedented that you were appointed again because you are an old person like, "The fire of the eons, and the water from the original existence." [Tib. བསྐལ་པའི་མེ་དང། སྲིད་པའི་ཆུ] and you are auspicious to have been appointed continuously [Tib. བསྐལ་པ་བཟང་པོ] and not get accused for the matter of the thief Gangtsug. Even if the higher ups wanted to say, "Well done." [for killing Gangtsug], they couldn't say that. Actually, it was helpful to the government that you put down [Tib. མཉའ་བཅག] [Gangtsug]. Therefore, you were appointed again. Actually, we pressed down the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཁ་ཚ་ར] A person of mixed Tibetan and Nepalese heritage.">katsara</a> [Nep. kha char], (the mix-breed between Tibetan and Nepalese); we didn't press down <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. སྡེ་བ་གཞུང] The name of the traditional Tibetan government.">dewashung</a> (the Tibetan Government), we raised the government up, so it was well done. Therefore, even if you can't work better than before, you must not work worse than before. You are very eloquent, so I don't have anything to tell you like, "Giving a new explanation for an old temple." [Tib. ལྷ་ཁང་རྙིང་པར་གནས་བཤད་གསར་པ]."   

**Q:**  How many people were there when the whole <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. བླ་སྤྱི] The highest administrative council in large monasteries, like Drepung. It consisted of the Abbots, the Tshogchen Umdze, the Shengo and the Jiso. In Drepung it also included ex-abbots.">Laji</a> met?   

**A:**  There were 11-12 <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. མཁན་པོ] Abbot of a monastery or monastic college.">khembo</a> and ex-khembo [Tib. མཁན་ཟུར], two <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཞལ་ངོ] 1. A junior officer in the traditional Tibetan Army in charge of a unit (platoon) of 25 soldiers (same as dingpön). 2. The two head disciplinary officials for all of Drepung Monastery and for the Mönlam Prayer Festival.">Shengo</a>, the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཚོགས་ཆེན་ཆེན་མོ] The prayer leader (Umdze) of the whole monastery.">Tsogchen chemmo</a>, the Phodrang Depa and the two Jiso. The <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. བླ་སྤྱི] The highest administrative council in large monasteries, like Drepung. It consisted of the Abbots, the Tshogchen Umdze, the Shengo and the Jiso. In Drepung it also included ex-abbots.">Laji</a> also served me left over rice and yogurt, and the Khembo tripa told the others, "Nobody can handle this person [me]. He is really tough."   

**Q:**  The other people who asked for the Chagdampa position might have thought that you had done something secretly to get it, right?   

**A:**  Yes, even the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཞལ་ངོ] 1. A junior officer in the traditional Tibetan Army in charge of a unit (platoon) of 25 soldiers (same as dingpön). 2. The two head disciplinary officials for all of Drepung Monastery and for the Mönlam Prayer Festival.">Shengo</a> might have thought that I had some backers because they were saying, "It is strange that Urgyen was appointed again." The two Shengo also said, "We hoped that you would ask for Chagdampa position again so we could support you. But if you didn't ask, we couldn't mention your name. But this time, it was well done that you got appointed again."   

**Q:**  When did the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. དྲུང་ཡིག་ཆེན་མོ] The title of the four heads of the Yigtsang Office (Ecclesiastics Office).">drunyichemmo</a> and those people come?   

**A:**  They came on the 6th of the 9th lunar month. [unclear]   

**Q:**  What did you do after the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. བླ་སྤྱི] The highest administrative council in large monasteries, like Drepung. It consisted of the Abbots, the Tshogchen Umdze, the Shengo and the Jiso. In Drepung it also included ex-abbots.">Laji</a> adjourned?   

**A:**  Then I went back to my <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. 1. ཤག, 2. ཞག] 1. The apartment/room of a monk. 2. The butter fat that coagulates on the top of butter-tea when the tea is left to sit for some time. If the tea had been made with a lot of butter, this layer could be thick enough to scoop off and save to later sell or eat separately. The senior monks are usually served tea with a lot of shag.">shag</a> (apartment). When we came to the Mönlam, I was the senior Chagdampa and I had to go with the junior <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཞལ་ངོ] 1. A junior officer in the traditional Tibetan Army in charge of a unit (platoon) of 25 soldiers (same as dingpön). 2. The two head disciplinary officials for all of Drepung Monastery and for the Mönlam Prayer Festival.">Shengo</a> and the junior Chagdampa had to go with the senior Shengo to the south gate of the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཇོ་ཁང] A most famous temple in Lhasa that houses a holy statue of the Buddha. It is often used to mean the Tsuglagang Temple of which it is a part.">Jokhang</a> where the Ganden monks were. The Sera monks would sit at the north side of the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. བར་སྐོར] The inner circumambulation road that goes around the Tsuglagang (Jokhang) Temple in Lhasa. This circular road was a main market area.">Barkor</a> and Sera Tago [Tib. ལྟག་སྒོ] back door. Since I was the senior Chagdampa, I had to look after the monks in the Shingra [Tib. སྐིང་ར] courtyard. The senior Chagdampa also had to go on patrol to the Nangtsesha. Then we received a letter saying that the two Shengo and the Chagdampa had to come to the Yigtsang. We went to <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. རྩེ] The Potala Palace.">Tse</a> riding horses and they asked who are the Chagdampa. The Shengo made the report. The Ta Lama [Tib. ཏབ་ལ་མ] said, "This is not going to be okay. We have to make a change because the Sera monks stay in the Drolma Lhagang [Tib. སྒྲོལ་མ་ལྷ་ཁང] area and the Ganden monks stay near the south gate. So you, the senior Chagdampa must do the work of the junior Chagdampa and the junior must do the work of the senior. You have to change this and return the money to the senior. So the junior Chagdampa returned 150 <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. རྡོ་ཚད] A currency unit in traditional Tibet that was equal to 50 ngüsang.">dotse</a> to me because the [senior's] work is harder. I had to escort the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. དགའ་ལྡན་ཁྲི་པ] The chief abbot of Ganden Monastery. He is considered to hold the throne of Tsongkapa, the founder of the Gelugpa sect.">Ganden Tripa</a> and I had to take charge of the Sera Tago back door and go to the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. རུང་ཁང] A monastic kitchen.">rungkhang</a> and check when they were using tea and the butter [Tib. ཇ་གད་མར་གད].   

**Q:**  Who gave the speeches in the prayer assembly [Tib. ཚོགས་གཏམ]?   

**A:**  Sometimes, I gave them and sometimes he gave them.   

**Q:**  Who gave the speech at the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. སྣང་རྩེ་ཤག] The main administrative office in Lhasa that was headed by the &quot;mayor&quot; or mipön.">Nangtsesha</a>?   

**A:**  Both of us had to give half of the speech. [unclear] At that time, the work duties of the two Chagdampa changed, but our way of seating remained as before. During my 9 years serving as Chagdampa, there weren't any quarrels and cases [Tib. ལབ་རྒྱུ་གླེང་རྒྱུ]. When the Japanese came to the Mönlam Torgya exorcism, something happened and they were stoned. So they [the Japanese] went to Trede Linga [Tib. འཕྲལ་བདེ་གླིང་ག] Office and later Möndrong Kungö <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཞོལ་པ] 1. The Tibetan government office responsible for law and order in Shöl (tib. ཞོལ), the walled town beneath the Potala, as well as for 18 districts (tib. རྫོང) around Lhasa. It handled mainly criminal cases including murder. 2. The head of the Shölpa leygung.">Shölpa</a> [Tib. སྨོན་གྲོང་སྐུ་ངོ་ཞོལ་པ] was the interpreter. He had great loyalty [to the government]. On that day, the Chagdampa and the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཞང་གོ་ཤིང་གཉེར] The monastic official in charge of fuel for the Great Prayer Festival in Lhasa (the Mönlam).">Shanggo shingnyer</a> were there. They put out chairs so we sat on chairs and the Japanese sat opposite us. [unclear]. One of the Japanese had wrapped white cloth on his head and was talking a lot, and there was one clerk from the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཞོལ] The walled town beneath the Potala Palace in Lhasa.">Shöl</a> Legung who said that his earring had been lost. Then 2-3 monks came who probably had beaten the clerk and they threw down his yellow cap (Tib. བོགདོ [འབོག་ཐོ]) and said, "Your bogdo is here. You wear this bogdo and get your salary from the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. སྡེ་བ་གཞུང] The name of the traditional Tibetan government.">dewashung</a> (government), but you serve the foreigners. Looking at this, we should have killed you, but this time we will overlook your actions [Tib. མ་ཡིན་གོ་ཡིན]." Then they showed their fist and told the clerk, "Can you see this [their fists]? We should have beat you with this!" This was during the Reting regency. When it was said that the Japanese had been stoned, we were called to the Shö gaa. It was the time when Ngagpa la [Tib. སྔགས་པ་ལགས] was the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. སྣེ་མགྲོན] The monk official in charge of the Regent&#x27;s Secretariat Office (shöga). He was the equivalent of the Lord Chamberlain in the Dalai Lama&#x27;s Secretariat.">nendrön</a>. He said that the Japanese were stoned at the time of the Mönlam Torgya so you must arrest the monks and ask what happened. By that time, the Mönlam was over and we told the nendrön that we hadn't known that the Japanese were stoned. We were in Lubu [Tib. ཀླུ་སྦུག] at the time of the Torgya and then we came up to report the departure [of the scapegoat], so we didn't know which monks stoned the Japanese. If you inquire and identify the monks who stoned the Japanese, then we will arrest them. The nendrön told me, "Can I report this?" I said, "Yes." Then we were told to go back and they didn't inquire about this.   

**Q:**  When you went to Trede Linga what did you talk about?   

**A:**  At that time, Möndrong Kungö told us that we have to say something clever (Tib. ཁེབོ [མཁས་པོ]) [about the Japanese]. We did as he said and they didn't say anything [argue]. They served us Indian tea and snacks. Möndrong Kungö told us that we had to give then a khata. We said [to them] that there will be such small cases and we said something cleverly. So they [Japanese] were very glad and they also took photos of us carrying the staff [of office] and another photo without carrying the staff. And they also gave us some sweets as a gift.   

**Q:**  At that time, were both of the Chagdampa there?   

**A:**  Yes. They also shook hands with us. Probably they were happy. After that nobody inquired about this.   

**Q:**  What is the name of the junior Chagdampa?   

**A:**  There were many junior Chagdampa [over the years], but at that time, the junior Chagdampa was called Gyentsen Chömpel [Tib. rhyal mtshan chos 'phel].   

**Q:**  Where was he from?   

**A:**  He was from Tölung Gyangkar [Tib. སྟོད་ལུང་གྱང་དཀར]. After that, there was the law case between the main <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. བཤད་སྒྲ] The name of the family of an important lay aristocratic official.">Shatra</a> family and the secondary branch of Shatra called Shatra Surpa.   

**Q:**  How about <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཁྲི་སྨོན] The name of the aristocratic family of an important lay official .">Trimön</a>?   

**A:**  There was a <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཁམས་པ] A person from the Kham region, a Tibetan from the Khamba (Khampa) sub-cultural group.">Khamba</a> staying in <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཁྲི་སྨོན] The name of the aristocratic family of an important lay official .">Trimön</a>'s House who was displaying his things for sale in the market called Wongtö Shinga [Tib. འོང་སྟོད་ཞིང་ག]. Then the Nangma told him that he had to pay a fee for the space he was using (Tib. སབླ [Tib. ས་གླ]), but he said, "I don't have to pay sabla. I am displaying my own things on my own space, so why should I pay you the sabla? You eat a big shit!" [Tib. སྐྱག་པ་ཆེ་བ་ཞིག་ཟོ་ཨ]. The Nangma said, "You gave me shit, right?" And he just left him there and reported this to the two <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཞལ་ངོ] 1. A junior officer in the traditional Tibetan Army in charge of a unit (platoon) of 25 soldiers (same as dingpön). 2. The two head disciplinary officials for all of Drepung Monastery and for the Mönlam Prayer Festival.">Shengo</a>. The Shengo said, "Both of the Chagdampa should go taking some Thabyog with them and they should bring him here." However, when we went there, he had already fled. He had gone home and shut his door tightly so we couldn't arrest him. However, after that, we opened the door and arrested him and took him to the Shengo's Office. We beat him with switches and locked him up. By that time, Trimön might have been the ex-kalön, kasur. He was wearing a white lower monk's garment [Tib. ཤམ་ཐབ་དཀར་པོ], a raw silk shawl [Tib. ལེམ་ཐང] and a monk's red vest (Tib. tönga [སྟོད་འགག]). He was carrying a cane and took a nun wearing a red <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཕྱུ་པ] The traditional Tibetan men and women&#x27;s dress. It is like a robe that is tied at the waist. Both men and women wear such dresses, although they differ slightly in color and in style.">chupa</a> as his servant.   

**Q:**  Where was he going?   

**A:**  He was going everywhere. I thought if we didn't apologize to him, it will go against the norms of loyalty [Tib. ལ་རྒྱ་ལ་འགྲོ་གི་མ་རེད] because he was a kalön. So the two of us Chagdampa went to apologize to him carrying a <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཁ་བཏགས] A Tibetan ceremonial scarf given to lamas, visitors, etc.">khata</a> ashe. When we went into <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཁྲི་སྨོན] The name of the aristocratic family of an important lay official .">Trimön</a>'s house, <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. སྐུ་ངོ] An honorific term of address for aristocratic officials. It is something like, &quot;Your Excellency.&quot;">kungö</a> Shügüpa [Tib. ཤུད་གུད་པ] was leaving.   

**Q:**  Was Shügüpa related to <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཁྲི་སྨོན] The name of the aristocratic family of an important lay official .">Trimön</a>?   

**A:**  Yes, probably. We told him that a very bad thing has happened [Tib. དཔེ་བསགས་བཞག], so we have to meet <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཁྲི་སྨོན] The name of the aristocratic family of an important lay official .">Trimön</a>. He told us to stay there. Shügüpa went inside and didn't come out for a long time. So we went near the veranda and there we saw that Trimön was running towards us wearing a shawl and Shügüpa was coming on this side. Then Trimön told us, "The compassionate <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. དཔོན་པོ, མངའ་བདག] 1. A manorial estate holder. 2. Chief of an area.">lord</a> has come. Please take me "[Tib. mi dbang thugs rje chen po phebs byung/ yag po zge rdag byung nga khrid rogs gnang] and he prostrated towards us three times. We didn't have any place to avoid him because one side was a wall and the other side was the stone floor. [unclear] We told him, "Kungö, please don't prostrate." Anyway, his hair knot was touching my boots. [unclear]. Then I told him, "We have come to apologize to you." He replied in a voice like singing, "Apology is apology" [Tib. དགོངས་སེལ་ལགས་དང་དགོངས་སེལ]. Then he said, "Please come in. Do you drink <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. 1. ཆང, 2. བྱང] 1. Tibetan locally brewed barley beer. 2. North; nomad areas north of Lhasa in Nagchuga Prefecture 3. ch. 厂 factory.">chang</a>?" Then Shügüpa told us to leave. On the next day, Trimön went to see Reting Rimpoche and told him, "Last night 21 Tsogchen <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཞལ་ངོ] 1. A junior officer in the traditional Tibetan Army in charge of a unit (platoon) of 25 soldiers (same as dingpön). 2. The two head disciplinary officials for all of Drepung Monastery and for the Mönlam Prayer Festival.">Shengo</a> and 30 Geyog came to arrest me. So please save my life." At that time, Trimön was wearing a <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཕྱུ་པ] The traditional Tibetan men and women&#x27;s dress. It is like a robe that is tied at the waist. Both men and women wear such dresses, although they differ slightly in color and in style.">chupa</a> called Tsechuma [Tib. ཚལ་ཕྱུ་མ] and a monk's vest called tönga. So we went to apologize to Reting. We met Drönyer la [his steward] and I told him that we want to apologize to Reting, but he said, "There is nothing to apologize for because this was a crazy person's talk and he also didn't wear his uniform but instead wore a Tsechuma and a monk's vest and moreover, he also went to the Kashag and told the Kashag, "The regent is a child and doesn't know anything." So there is no need to take care of anything and no need to apologize. So we didn't need to apologize to Reting and the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཁམས་པ] A person from the Kham region, a Tibetan from the Khamba (Khampa) sub-cultural group.">Khamba</a> was released. On the next day, Trimön took a nun servant and carried a cane and he entered the door of the big kitchen (rungkhang chemmo) and climbed up the inner stone steps and came to the Shengo's office and said, "Tsogchen Shengo la are you in? [Tib. ཚོགས་ཆེན་ཞལ་ངོ་ལགས་བཞུགས་ཡོད་པས]. Then he left and then came back to the Shengo's office and said the same thing. He did the same thing three times. Then the Kashag also didn't care about him. [unclear] [part missing on tape] We went there [?] according to Kashag's order carrying a <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཁ་བཏགས] A Tibetan ceremonial scarf given to lamas, visitors, etc.">khata</a> [unclear[ and then he gave us 25 dotse and we could get skin bags of butter and rice from the Laja Office, the Tseja Office, the Shöl Legung and also from the Tsamshe Legung [Tib. རྩམ་བཞེས་ལས་ཁུངས] [Which was the treasury that collects grain products mainly used for rituals.) We accumulated this stuff for the picnic given by the two Shengo after the Tsongjö Prayer Festival. We had a picnic for two days and used about 100 dotse which was common money [rather than their private money].   

**Q:**  When you met the Chinese officials, what do you tell them and what did they say?   

**A:**  I don't remember that. We just chitchatted and they said that they went to see the Kashag.   

**Q:**  What happened when the Chinese looked from the roof of their house during the Mönlam Torgya?   

**A:**  At that time, the Chinese official and the interpreter came to the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཞལ་ངོ] 1. A junior officer in the traditional Tibetan Army in charge of a unit (platoon) of 25 soldiers (same as dingpön). 2. The two head disciplinary officials for all of Drepung Monastery and for the Mönlam Prayer Festival.">Shengo</a>'s office two days before the Torgya.   

**Q:**  Was it on the Lubu Gardrig [Tib. ཀླུ་སྒུག་གར་སྒྲིག] (the ceremony where the soldiers parade in ancient uniforms)?   

**A:**  Probably it was.   

**Q:**  There was an interpreter from Wapaling [Ch. he ba liang], right?   

**A:**  Yes. They also gave us a <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཁ་བཏགས] A Tibetan ceremonial scarf given to lamas, visitors, etc.">khata</a> Ashe and said [unclear], Please grant us permission to watch Mönlam Torgya from our roof." We said we will report this to the Kashag. It was the time of the Reting regency and we reported to the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. སྣེ་མགྲོན] The monk official in charge of the Regent&#x27;s Secretariat Office (shöga). He was the equivalent of the Lord Chamberlain in the Dalai Lama&#x27;s Secretariat.">nendrön</a> that the Chinese wanted to see the Regent. Then the Chinese came just before it was dark and we told them, "We have never let the Chinese watch the Mönlam Torgya from the roof, but we will give you special permission to watch from the roof. They put rugs on the edge of the roof [Tib. ཉ་རྒྱབ] and watched the Mönlam Torgya. Some might have been sitting on chairs and they were also taking photos. The Ladhakis, Gorkha (Nepalese) and Khunu were watching from the roof top of a one story house in front of the Jokhang. Otherwise, nobody was allowed to watch the Mönlam Torgya from the roof tops.   

**Q:**  Would you please tell us in detail from the beginning about the thief Gangstug?   

**A:**  One day, I was eating <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. སྤགས] A staple Tibetan dish of tsampa mixed with tea and kneaded into balls of dough-like consistency.">pag</a> in the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཞལ་ངོ] 1. A junior officer in the traditional Tibetan Army in charge of a unit (platoon) of 25 soldiers (same as dingpön). 2. The two head disciplinary officials for all of Drepung Monastery and for the Mönlam Prayer Festival.">Shengo</a>'s office. From the place where the junior Shengo sits, he can see the road outside and one day the junior Shengo told me "Sir, [Tib. སྐུ་ཞབས] look there." At that time, Lobsang Jimpa was under the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. སྒོ་མཆོར] The area outside of the monastic assembly hall that is supported by tall pillars.">gomchor</a> and he could see the place down there. When I was eating pag in Shengo's office, the junior Shengo told me that a Korchagpa [Tib. སྐོར་འཆག་པ], (a low level worker who patrols the streets and delivers messages in Lhasa) was bringing a person by his hair. The junior Shengo told me to get up even though I was eating pag and go down there. When I asked what happened, the Korchagpa said, "People saw this person stealing a pair of trousers from the Lama <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. རྒྱུད་པ] The two Tantric Colleges in Lhasa: the Upper Tantric College and the Lower Tantric College.">Gyüpa</a>'s place where they were selling used household items in <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. རྒྱ་འབུམ་སྒང] A famous monk official of the Trunyichemmo rank.">Gyambumgang</a> [Tib. རྗེ་འབུམ་སྒང], so I caught him at the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. རྨེ་རུ] Name of a monastery in the northern part of Lhasa.">Muru</a> Damra [Tib. རྨེ་རུ་འདམ་ར]. Therefore, please give him a severe punishment, because he has many collaborators [Tib. ལག་འབྲེལ] who come in gangs [Tib. དཔུང་སྒྲིག]. We couldn't catch him until now." At this time, I became like possessed by a deity and I told them to bring him up and I beat him with switches about 20-30 times. [unclear] Usually, I would sleep in the veranda in the Shengo's Office and on the night before this thief was caught, I saw in my dream someone sitting on a chair in front of me who told me, "You can't find his partners, so just go ahead and kill him by beating him with switches. Otherwise, he will cause s lot of trouble." Then I said yes in my dream and the Shengo's office was packed with people and I felt shivering in my body. After some time, someone woke me up and when I woke up, I was very agitated. Then I got up and washed my face and when we were drinking boiled water, I told them about my dream and I said how about me asking Tema [a deity] for a prophecy? The senior Shengo said, "It is said that dreams are impermanent and illusions. If they are permanent, bring my [late] mother " [Tib. rmi lam mi rtag 'phrul pa yin/ rtag pa yin na ngs'i a ma khrid shog].   

**Q:**  Who was the senior <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཞལ་ངོ] 1. A junior officer in the traditional Tibetan Army in charge of a unit (platoon) of 25 soldiers (same as dingpön). 2. The two head disciplinary officials for all of Drepung Monastery and for the Mönlam Prayer Festival.">Shengo</a>?   

**A:**  He was called Chögye la [Tib. ཆོས་རྒྱལ་ལགས]. The junior <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཞལ་ངོ] 1. A junior officer in the traditional Tibetan Army in charge of a unit (platoon) of 25 soldiers (same as dingpön). 2. The two head disciplinary officials for all of Drepung Monastery and for the Mönlam Prayer Festival.">Shengo</a> called Namkha la [Tib. ནམ་མཁའ་ལགས]. He was from <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. སྡེ་ཡངས] One of the colleges in Drepung Monastery.">Deyang</a> College. He also said, "It is said don't trust whatever you heard." [Tib. བཤད་ཚད་བདེན་པར་མི་འཛིན], so there is nothing to trust in dreams, but the dream you see after midnight is regarded as a somewhat reliable." Then when we beat that thief, he said his partner was nicknamed "the pork-marked young monk," (Injung Bartsag [Tib. ཨིན་ཆུང་སྦར་ཚག]). He told us that he is in the tea <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཞོ] A unit in the traditional Tibetan currency system. 10 sho equaled to 1 sang and 10 karma equaled one sho.">sho</a>p near the Nepalese Consulate. I said that we should stop people coming out from that house because Injung Bartsag will jump out from behind the small house and flee. I took two Nangma and some Thabyog and went to arrest him. When we came near <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. བཤད་སྒྲ] The name of the family of an important lay aristocratic official.">Shatra</a>'s House, I told the Geyog not to shout because he may get frightened and run away. When the Geyog went inside, Injung Bartsag was climbing up a ladder [to flee]. Then the Geyog hit him with his stick and he fell down and we arrested him. When we arrested him, he said that he has a partner called <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཁམས་པ] A person from the Kham region, a Tibetan from the Khamba (Khampa) sub-cultural group.">Khamba</a> Chöndze who wore a <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཕྱུ་པ] The traditional Tibetan men and women&#x27;s dress. It is like a robe that is tied at the waist. Both men and women wear such dresses, although they differ slightly in color and in style.">chupa</a> made from woolen material and on top of that he wore a chupa made from the raw silk called Shutsidru [Ch. xu zi chou]. He also wore a pair of long boots and golden rings and a jade bracelet. He didn't look like a thief at all. Then we took back Injung Bartsag who had broken down the door of an old man and woman. When we brought him, the old man and woman told us, "Thank you very much." Then the two Shengo asked the deity Tema to go into trance and give a prophecy, but they didn't tell her clearly, so as Tema was about to go into trance, I told the deity, "Until now, we have been propitiating you by offering you <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཁ་བཏགས] A Tibetan ceremonial scarf given to lamas, visitors, etc.">khata</a> and <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. 1. ཆང, 2. བྱང] 1. Tibetan locally brewed barley beer. 2. North; nomad areas north of Lhasa in Nagchuga Prefecture 3. ch. 厂 factory.">chang</a>, but now in Lhasa, there are many thieves coming in gangs of 18-19 just in front of the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. དཔོན་པོ, མངའ་བདག] 1. A manorial estate holder. 2. Chief of an area.">lord</a>s and lamas of the government. So if you do not give the prophecy, it useless to propitiate you." Then the deity gave me the prophecy. The medium really had gone into trance and she said, "Hir hir," and then threw blessed barley. [Translator's note: Here Urgyen was reciting the prophecy at a very high speed with an intonation just like the oracle had said. The interviewer pretended to understand so didn't tell him to say it slowly, so the following translation is just a small part of the prophecy that I could understand.] "If you trust fully, you will get the full result and if you trust half you will get half a result. You put your knees down and ask <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. གནས་ཆུང] 1. One of the main protector deities of the Tibetan government and the Dalai Lama. 2. The monastery in which the medium of Nechung resides that is located just east of Drepung Monastery.">Nechung</a> for a prophecy. Do not talk much. I will help you [Tib. བློས་སྒང་ག་བཀལ་ན་སྒང་ག་དང། ཕྱེད་ཀ་བཀལ་ན་ཕྱེད་ཀ། པུས་མོའི་ལྷ་ང་ས་ལ་བཙུགས་ནས་རྡོ་རྗེ་གྲགས་ལྡན་ལ་ཞུས། སྨྲ་བ་མ་མང། སྡོང་གྲོགས་ཡོང] Then I told them to make Khamba Chöndze, the thief, lay down and I beat him with switches in front of the old man and woman. The old man and the woman yelled, "We Thank the compassionate lord very much! [Tib. དཔོན་པོ་ཐུགས་རྗེ་ཆེན་པོ་ཐུགས་ཆེ་གནང]. Probably, there were about 1,000 people in the crowd watching when he beat the thief. Then we took Khamba Chöndze through the meat market and the place where they shoe horses. Injung Bartsag came there and told Khamba Chöndze, "Brother, please confess well." [Tib. ལྕོག་སྐུ་མཁྱེན་ཡག་པོ་ཞུ་རོགས]. Khamba Chöndze replied, "I don't know you!" Then Injung Bartsag said, "Please don't say that you don't know me." Then I tied up Khamba Chöndze and took him to his home, but his house was empty and then I told the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཐབ་གཡོག] Monks or laymen who work as servants/manual laborers in kitchens (normally monastic kitchens).">thabyog</a> to hold the thief well. Then the two <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ནང་མ] A minor monk assistant to the Shengo at the Mönlam Chemmo Prayer Festival. These nangma ranked below the Chagdampa.">nangma</a> were coming holding small whips like they use for donkeys. They said they paid 4 <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. སྲང] A unit of traditional Tibetan currency. It was also called ngüsang [tib. དངུལ་སྲང]. 50 nügsang = 1 dotse; 10 sho = 1 nügsang; 20 5-karma coins = 1 ngüsang. There were also paper currency notes of 7-sang, 25-sang, and 10-sang denominations.">sang</a> and 5 sho for the whips. Then I told them to make the thief lay down and whipped him right there. I was afraid that he might flee if we didn't put him down. Then both of the thieves said that Gangstug is in the Nepalese Consulate. So we went to the Nepalese Consulate and they said, "He had gone out to roam around, and will come back only in the evening. He is fond of gambling with dice and the mahjong, so probably he went to a park. In a house in the Nepalese Consulate, there was a statue and they had offered 100 butter lamps. [unclear}   

**Q:**  Was this Gangtsug's house?   

**A:**  No. Gangtsug's house was also in the Nepalese Consulate. Then it was quite late and it was about the time to hold the evening tea assembly meeting. Then someone gave me some tea which was helpful because I was thirsty. Then there were some Nepalese soldiers there talking in Nepalese about Gangtsug. I could understand a little Nepalese although I couldn't speak it. The soldiers were saying in Nepalese, "He is here and this is his house." Then I told the Nangma, "You go back, but I am not going back until my work is done." Then I told the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཐབ་གཡོག] Monks or laymen who work as servants/manual laborers in kitchens (normally monastic kitchens).">thabyog</a> to smash the door. There was no choice but to smash the door. Even if I died, I won't stop breathing. [Tib. ཤི་ནའི་དབུག་འགྲོ་བ་མི་འདུག]. Then they [Nepalese] said please don't break the door, we will bring the key and they brought a key with a bell attached to it. Then I said, "He [Gangtsug] is a thief who is well known in India and Tibet [Tib. རྒྱ་གྲགས་བོད་གྲགས] and you are the thief's household [Tib. རྐུན་ཚང] and you have collaborated with the thief, right? Then they told Gangtsug to come out and he came out. Gangtsug was a tall pockmarked man with a Kongpo hairstyle. He was wearing the kind of boots called Garlo and a chupa. Then I told him, "Wow! Are you the one called Thief Gangtsug? You are really handsome, tall and have an imposing face" [Tib. a po/ kyed rang rkun ma rkang btsugs zer mkhan de yin pas/ bkar bzo dod po 'dug ga/ sku gzugs che ba jig'dug/ zhal ras rdzig pa jig 'dug]. Then I told them to tie him up. At this time, the alley near the Nepalese Consulate was packed with people. The Nepalese said, "You don't need to tie him. He is not a thief and from generation to generation they have never stolen anything. I swear by the Gota [Urdu. gota kasam] that his father didn't steal anything except he caught a small amount of fish. You can take him to the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཞལ་ངོ] 1. A junior officer in the traditional Tibetan Army in charge of a unit (platoon) of 25 soldiers (same as dingpön). 2. The two head disciplinary officials for all of Drepung Monastery and for the Mönlam Prayer Festival.">Shengo</a>'s office. They also told Gangtsug, "You must report well to the Shengo's office and tell them what you did and what you didn't do. Then we will go to the Shengo's office and talk with them and we will request that the Kashag, <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཞོལ] The walled town beneath the Potala Palace in Lhasa.">Shöl</a> Legung and the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. སྣང་རྩེ་ཤག] The main administrative office in Lhasa that was headed by the &quot;mayor&quot; or mipön.">Nangtsesha</a> should release you." I said, "You can tell Shöl Legung and the Nangtsesha [unclear], but the Shengo's office is in charge of law and order [Tib. ཁྲིམས] during the Mönlam. Then I asked them if he is a thief and they said he wasn't. You tell me that he is not a thief and tell me to untie him, so I will untie his ropes, but can you prove that he is not a thief?" They said, "Yes." So then I untied Gangtsug and tied up the Nepalese who told me to untie the thief. Then he said, "Please do not tie me" [unclear] and he was kicking Gangtsug saying, "This is all because of you." Then I said, "We didn't tie you up, but you told me to untie him saying that he was not a thief. Therefore, I tied you up." Then he said, "I have the title of an official [Tib. ལས་བྱེད་པ] and I have a red tassel on my horse." I said, "There is nothing to be surprised about you having a tassel because the donkeys, horses and mules also have tassels. Because you supported the thief, I have tied you up." Then I tied him and we arrested two people.   

**Q:**  Who do you mean two people?   

**A:**  Gangtsug and the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཁམས་པ] A person from the Kham region, a Tibetan from the Khamba (Khampa) sub-cultural group.">Khamba</a> Chöndze.   

**Q:**  Who was that Nepalese? Was he the captain [Tib. དཔོན་པོ]? [Tibetans called the head of the Nepal Office "captain"]   

**A:**  He was the interpreter to the captain and the second official under the captain.   

**Q:**  Was he a Nepalese born in Lhasa?   

**A:**  His face looks like a Nepalese, but he was a Muslim with a beard. Then I untied the Nepalese and tied the thieves.   

**Q:**  What did he [Nepalese] say?   

**A:**  He was crying and snot was coming from his nose and then he said, "He [Gangtsug] is the thief; he stole the things." Then I told him, "You must be careful what you say. Otherwise, you will make a mistake." [Tib. ཁ་ལ་བདག་པོ་ཡག་པོ་རྒྱག་དགོས་རེད]. Then the two Nangma took the thieves to the place called Sabokhang [Tib. ས་བོག་སྒང] in front of the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཇོ་ཁང] A most famous temple in Lhasa that houses a holy statue of the Buddha. It is often used to mean the Tsuglagang Temple of which it is a part.">Jokhang</a> and told the thieves to kneel. There was a pile of switches there. [unclear] Then I relaxed and went there. All the Geyog have already come by that time, and the monk and lay officials were packed in the upstairs of the Jokhang in the big rooms with large windows faced to the south and west [Tib. ཟུར་ལྗོངས་རབ་གསལ] that overlooked the Sabokhang. And there were more people in Sabokhang than in the Mönlam Torgya. Then I stripped him completely naked and I told Gangtsug, "You, Gangtsug look at the three of them carefully [the thieves] and see how they got beaten from the beginning to the end [unclear]. You, however, had been free like an innocent person [Tib. དཀར་པོ་གུ་ཡང] and you didn't get beaten, so now you must get naked." And then I started beating him with switches. Then [unclear] a Geyog called Gobshag came out with a stick and [unclear] and he [?] was bleeding from his neck and he ran away [unclear] and nobody caught him and he didn't come back. Then we beat Gangtsug and locked him up in prison. At that time, the Mönlam Jigyab [Tib. སྤྱི་ཁྱབ] official was Künsangtse [Tib. ཀུན་བཟང་རྩེ] Dzasa (and general), and the tsendrön was Thubden Gawa La [Tib. ཐུབ་བསྟན་དགའ་བ་ལགས]. The Nyertsangnga [Tib. གཉེར་ཚང་བ] was Changöpa [Tib. བྱ་དངོས་པ]. Then I was called in by them and they told me to sit down and they said, "Whatever good or bad happened, we are with you." Then they asked where is the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཞང་གོ་ཤིང་གཉེར] The monastic official in charge of fuel for the Great Prayer Festival in Lhasa (the Mönlam).">Shanggo shingnyer</a> and the Geyog. I said they were coming. Then all of us were asked what we are going to do about the [Gangtsug case]. I said, "We will work together. No matter what happens, even if we have to wear cangue on our necks and if we are told, we will jump into the river." And all the others also yelled after me saying, "We agree to do as he said." [Tib. ཁོང་གིས་བཤད་པ་དེ་རང་ཡིན]. And we also said if they provoke us we have to challenge them. The senior <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཞལ་ངོ] 1. A junior officer in the traditional Tibetan Army in charge of a unit (platoon) of 25 soldiers (same as dingpön). 2. The two head disciplinary officials for all of Drepung Monastery and for the Mönlam Prayer Festival.">Shengo</a> told the [above mentioned officials], "Kungö, you have called the Chagdampa. Please tell us what you want to tell him. If we think it is right, we will do it. If we think it is wrong, we will not do it." Then they [the officials] said, "The Katsara [half-Nepalese] said that they want Gangtsug to be handed over to them." [due to extra-territoriality]. Then the Shengo said, "Do you mean that we have to hand over Gangtsug? Did the Nepalese give you your title and the golden amulet you wear on your hair knot? Did the Nepalese give you your tsendrön title and your <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཆབ་བླུག] The stylized (empty) water bottle worn by monk officials in the Tibetan government.">chablug</a> [Tib. ཆབ་བླུག] water bottle and the pen case [Tib. གསེར་རིལ་སྨྱུག་སྒྲོག]. Now it is like the loose shit came to visit the shit [Tib. སྐྱག་པའི་རྩ་ལ་རྙང་མ་བཅར་བ]. Now you tell us what you want. You just tell us whether we are allowed to give the legal punishment or not. [unclear]." Then Künsangtse was agitated and said something [unclear] and there was no conclusion. Then we said, "You don't need to report this to the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཤོད་འགག] The Secretariat of the regent.">shö ga</a>, we will report it because we are the ones who give the legal punishment." They said, "You can report it if you want to." Then we came back and it was time for the evening tea.   

**Q:**  Was this at the time of Mönlam Torgya?   

**A:**  No. It was after the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཚོགས་མཆོད] The large religious prayer festival held in Lhasa in the 2nd Tibetan lunar month.">Tsongjö</a>, on about the 25th. Then he [the <a href "#" data-tooltip "[tib. ཞལ་ངོ] 1. A junior officer in the traditional Tibetan Army in charge of a unit (platoon) of 25 soldiers (same as dingpön). 2. The two head disciplinary officials for all of Drepung Monastery and for the Mönlam Prayer Festival.">Shengo</a>] told me that I and the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཞང་གོ་ཤིང་གཉེར] The monastic official in charge of fuel for the Great Prayer Festival in Lhasa (the Mönlam).">Shanggo shingnyer</a> must go to see the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. བཀའ་བློན] One of the heads of the Kashag [bka&#x27; shag] or Council of Ministers. There were usually 4 Kalön, although in the 1950s the number increased at various times to 6 or 7. The Kalön ministers made decisions collectively, and had no fixed term of office.">Kalön</a> Lama Temba Jayan [Tib. བསྟན་པ་འཇམ་དབྱངས]. So after the evening tea, we went to <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. རྨེ་རུ] Name of a monastery in the northern part of Lhasa.">Muru</a> [Tib. རྨེ་རུ] to see Temba Jayan and we got a chance to see him right away. He told us to come in and then I offered a <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཁ་བཏགས] A Tibetan ceremonial scarf given to lamas, visitors, etc.">khata</a> scarf and told him everything that happened and he just said, "Oh. I see. Yes yes." Then I said, "We came to seek your advice [Tib. དགོངས་སྐོར་ཞུ]. Then he said, "You have the monastic charter [Tib. བཅའ་ཡིག] issued by the 5th Dalai Lama, so there is nothing to ask anybody about what to do. [meaning that they have the legal right to punish people during the Mönlam] It is like first we cut the cloth and then we sew the cloth, right? If you tie the rope to the animal's nose, it cannot go everywhere. If you didn't tie the rope to the animal's nose, then it will go everywhere. It is like this. The Tsogchen Shengo is just for one year and after that you will become an ordinary monk and you will put your boots on your shoulder and cover your head with a towel, right? The charter issued by the 5th Dalai Lama is like, 'Even if the water passed by, the pebbles will still remain.' [Tib. ཆུ་ཕྱིན་ཀྱང་ཟམ་པ་སྡོད་ཀྱི་རེད]. The monastic charter will remain forever. If you don't think carefully, you will get into trouble! [Tib. མགོ་ལོག་རྩེད་ཡོང་ང] If you ask people too much and can't make your own decisions and withdraw [Tib. ཕྱིར་འཐེན] [from your decision], you will get into trouble. You have to make the decision. There is nothing to ask about. Do you understand?" Then we said, "Thank you so much." The Shengo were also glad to hear that, so that night we beat Gangtsug with switches. When the white banner of the Tsongjö Sebang reached the stupa Kaling Gobshi [Tib. ཀར་ནེ་སྒོ་བཞི] [at the north side of the Barkor], Gangtsug died.   

**Q:**  When they sent out the Lugong, was he dead?   

**A:**  Yes. We were there when the Lugong was sent out and when we all came back, the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཞལ་ངོ] 1. A junior officer in the traditional Tibetan Army in charge of a unit (platoon) of 25 soldiers (same as dingpön). 2. The two head disciplinary officials for all of Drepung Monastery and for the Mönlam Prayer Festival.">Shengo</a>'s office was empty. [unclear] Then on the next morning, we had to make a report and on the day after that, I received a message in front the Kaling Gobshi from the two Shengo telling me to come to the Shengo's office where they said that Gangtsug had died. I said, "There is nothing for me to do because I am not a lama who can transfer his consciousness. You carry a <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཁ་བཏགས] A Tibetan ceremonial scarf given to lamas, visitors, etc.">khata</a> and report to the junior lama in <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཞོལ] The walled town beneath the Potala Palace in Lhasa.">Shöl</a>." [unclear] When I was coming near the gate of Shöl [recording stopped for a while]. When the Sebang ended, people were packed near the Shengo's officer and we put on the clothing for dressing corpses [Tib. རོ་གོས] on Gangtsug's body and threw it out from the Shengo's office. Probably, they didn't tie the body well and the body fell out on the ground. Then the body was carried away by the government's untouchable caste of people who take away the corpses of the beggars [Tib. རགྱབ]. Then we handed over the other thieves to the Nangtsesha. Then in the 4th month, we were called to the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཡིག་ཚང] The highest office dealing with monastic and religious affairs in the traditional Tibetan government. It is often called the Ecclesiastic Office. It was headed by 4 fourth rank monk officials called Trunyichemmo. The senior Trunyichemmo was called Ta Lama.">Yigtsang</a> regarding the Gangtsug case. I was called there after the 15th. Probably on the 20th, the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. འགག] 1. Abbreviation of Tsega, the Secretariat Office of the Dalai Lama.">gaa</a> gave the order and we were scolded a lot by the drunyichemmo.   

**Q:**  Was that the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཡིག་ཚང] The highest office dealing with monastic and religious affairs in the traditional Tibetan government. It is often called the Ecclesiastic Office. It was headed by 4 fourth rank monk officials called Trunyichemmo.

**A:**  Yes. And then the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. མཁན་པོ] Abbot of a monastery or monastic college.">khembo</a> sat down.   

**Q:**  How many <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. མཁན་པོ] Abbot of a monastery or monastic college.">khembo</a> were there?   

**A:**  There were about 11-12 <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. མཁན་པོ] Abbot of a monastery or monastic college.">khembo</a> and the two <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཞལ་ངོ] 1.

Actually all the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. བླ་སྤྱི] The highest administrative council in large monasteries, like Drepung. It consisted of the Abbots, the Tshogchen Umdze, the Shengo and the Jiso. In Drepung it also included ex-abbots.">Laji</a> were there. We two Chagdampa were bending over at the waist.   

**Q:**  Did Ngagpa la ask you the questions?   

**A:**  Yes.   

**Q:**  What other <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. དྲུང་ཡིག་ཆེན་མོ] The title of the four heads of the Yigtsang Office (Ecclesiastics Office).">drunyichemmo</a> were there?   

**A:**  <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. རམ་པ] The family name of a well known aristocratic monk official who was a Kalön.">Rampa</a>, Jawdang and Bumtang [Tib. འབུམ་ཐང] were there. Then the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. དྲུང་ཡིག་ཆེན་མོ] The title of the four heads of the Yigtsang Office (Ecclesiastics Office).">drunyichemmo</a> told us to stay relaxed and the Ta Lama was laughing. [unclear]. Then we were called in and the Ta Lama read the verdict. The Ta Lama said, "This is not an interrogation with a seal on it [Tib. ཞུ་བ་རྒྱགས་སྦྱར]. Rather it is a note with a seal on it [Tib. ཚིག་ཐོ་རྟགས་སྦྱར]. The <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཡིག་ཚང] The highest office dealing with monastic and religious affairs in the traditional Tibetan government. It is often called the Ecclesiastic Office. It was headed by 4 fourth rank monk officials called Trunyichemmo. The senior Trunyichemmo was called Ta Lama.">Yigtsang</a> didn't interrogate you. All the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. བླ་སྤྱི] The highest administrative council in large monasteries, like Drepung. It consisted of the Abbots, the Tshogchen Umdze, the Shengo and the Jiso. In Drepung it also included ex-abbots.">Laji</a> have to know this because the monks are fierce [Tib. བཀའ་གཉན་པོ]. We just made a note of whatever you said. Now all of us were standing and the Ta Lama said, "You know how to eat, but don't know how to work. From the beginning, if you had reported the case clearly it would have settled earlier, but you didn't report clearly. But it is good that now you have reported clearly, so we thank you for this. You might have a pain in your waist. Then we left the Yigtsang and went back to the monastery. [unclear] At that time about 1,000 monks were there receiving us.   

**Q:**  Probably, they knew about the Gangtsug case, right?   

**A:**  Yes, probably. [unclear] The the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. མཁན་པོ] Abbot of a monastery or monastic college.">khembo</a> told the monks,"We went to see them [<a href "#" data-tooltip "[tib. ཡིག་ཚང] The highest office dealing with monastic and religious affairs in the traditional Tibetan government. It is often called the Ecclesiastic Office. It was headed by 4 fourth rank monk officials called Trunyichemmo. The senior Trunyichemmo was called Ta Lama.">Yigtsang</a>?] many times, because it was like the patient didn't meet the right doctor and didn't get the right medicine. Regarding catching the thieves, the Chagdampa was called by the Yigtsang and he reported clearly about the case. The Yigtsang's anger ceased [Tib. dgongs pa dangs] and they wrote about the case on the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. སམ་ཁྲ] The traditional rectangular wooden writing/message board. The message was written on the polished, blackened surface of the wood that was covered with a white chalk. A stylus was used to clear away the chalk leaving the shape of the letters, which appeared black. It was usually about 12-14 inches long and 2 inches wide. There was a lower board on which the messages were written and a top board which served as the cover. In many cases there were several additional writing boards between these two.">samtra</a> and then this was copied onto paper and it became a note with a seal on it. This was not an interrogation report with a seal on it. The Yigtsang said that they are going to report this to the regent. Then the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. བླ་སྤྱི] The highest administrative council in large monasteries, like Drepung. It consisted of the Abbots, the Tshogchen Umdze, the Shengo and the Jiso. In Drepung it also included ex-abbots.">Laji</a> reported that if there is any punishment or fine, we, the Laji will take it. We, reported, "If the Yigtsang couldn't stop their anger, all of <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. སེ་འབྲས་དགའ་གསུམ] The abbreviation used for the three great monastic seats around Lhasa: Sera, Drepung and Ganden Monasteries.">Sendregasum</a> will meet and make a report." Then the Yigtsang said that we don't need to do that. The case will be settled. So all of you can relax because everything is going to be okay. The monks said thank you and all of them returned.

The khembo told me, "The <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. སྐུ་དྲག] 1. A member of the lay aristocracy. 2. Title for government lay and monk officials. 3. A name occasionally used for the top leaders/officials in a monastery.">kudrak</a> are malicious, so we have to be careful. I was wearing the vest made from brocade, but I changed into another one. When we went there, it was the time of <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. དྲུང་ཇ] The daily meeting of Tibetan government monk officials (tsedrung) at which tea was provided. However, unlike the collective meetings of monks in monasteries, there was no collective chanting of prayers at the Drungja. The event started at around 9 a.m. and lasted for about an hour. When the Tse ga (the Dalai Lama&#x27;s Secretariat) was in the Potala, it was held there, and when it was in the Norbulinga Summer Palace, it was held there. All monk officials in Lhasa were expected to attend.">drungja</a> and we waited until the drungja was over and then we were called before the Yigtsang and they gave us an order which said, "This time we will overlook your acts [Tib. མ་ཡིན་གོ་ཡིན] because the case was settled like piercing the puss with a knife [Tib. རྣག་ཐོག་གཙག་འཁེལ]. But you are not allowed to do that again and all of you have to do well and the Laji has to give instructions to the monastic officials and the Laji should keep this order in the document box and read it when a new Shengo comes."   

**Q:**  What did they write in the order?   

**A:**  They wrote all about Gangtsug and the cause of the case and most of that was what I had reported to them. They couldn't say that it was well done, but they didn't say it was done badly. They left it sort of like neutral [Tib. བཏང་སྙོམས]. It neither said that we are allowed to work at our job, nor it did it say that we are not allowed to work. At that time, some people spread a rumor that the senior <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཞལ་ངོ] 1. A junior officer in the traditional Tibetan Army in charge of a unit (platoon) of 25 soldiers (same as dingpön). 2. The two head disciplinary officials for all of Drepung Monastery and for the Mönlam Prayer Festival.">Shengo</a> and the senior Chagdampa will be sentenced to life imprisonment and the junior Shengo and the junior Chagdampa will be handed over to the Damba [Tib. དན་འབག] <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. གཞུང་རྒྱུགས་པ] A type of bound peasant/miser/serf whose lord was the government rather than an aristocrat or monastery/lama.

In the next year, we became the Chagdampa and Shingnyer again, even though we didn't ask for it. I did the Chagdampa for 9 years and then I became the Gegö.
