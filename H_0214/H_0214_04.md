### Tape 4  
**Q:**  What happened then?   

**A:**  I was under the ladder and I would have heard what they were talking about, but they had finished their conversation. I heard the junior Shengo tell Tsag Serkhang's steward Penjor [Tib. rtsag ser khang gnyer pa dpal 'byor], "Tomorrow, when the mangja is over and we [Shengo] go to urinate, you must offer a khata to the two Chagdampa and make the report. You should not say anything about the two of us having talked [Tib. nga gnyis skad cha byung ba shod rgyu yod ma red]." The steward said, "Of course I will not say that and I will come tomorrow morning." Then they said, "probably, we might have to give something to the pockmarked one." [Tib. 'bar tshag la jig dgos dwogs med a].   

**Q:**  The reference to the "pockmarked," was you, right?   

**A:**  Yes, probably, [laughter] although they didn't mention my name. Then the junior Shengo said, "There is no need to do that because there is no custom of doing like that." Their conversation was finishing. Then I was afraid that they might see me so I came back quickly. Then I coughed to make a signal and asked the thabyog, "Who is over there? Somebody is talking. Go get them." The thabyog said, "Yes." and went there, but all of them had fled and the junior Shengo might have fled together. [laughter]. I know that the Shengo was with them, so I wouldn't try to chase them, right? Then I went into the Shengo's office and the senior Shengo told me, "Chagdampa la, what's the matter? You spoke loudly! [Tib. ga re 'dug/ gsung zhed po cig bskyon song]. I said, "Who knows! There were three people talking a lot in front of the ladder." He said, "Who were they?" I said, "I don't know because it was dark. I sent the thabyog to catch them, but they couldn't." Although he knew that the junior Shengo was there, he said, "It is strange. Who could they be? " I said, "I couldn't recognize them." Right at this time, the cushion on which the junior Shengo sat was empty.  After 5 minutes, the junior Shengo came in and told me, "Sir! (Tib. gusho [sku zhabs]) What's the matter? You were yelling loudly! I said, "There were 3-4 people talking in front of the ladder and I told them to catch them, but they couldn't." Though he himself was among them, he said, "Who could they be?" I said I don't know. I couldn't recognize them." He said, "This is strange". The next morning, when the morning prayer session was over, Trendong's steward and Tsag Serkhang's steward Penjor La were already there in front of the Shengo's office. They saw me and did the polite greeting to me (Tib. chambö shü [phyag 'bul zhus] and told me that they want to come in. I said, "Do you want to come in?" They said, "Yes." I told them to wait there. Then I told the Shengo, "Trendong's steward and Tsag Serkhang's steward Penjor La want to come in. The senior Shengo said, "That's strange. What are they here for? [Tib. ga re yin na]. I said they want to come in. Then the Shengo called them in and then they took out a khata scarf and made their report [about the dispute and the Ganden monks gathering to support the main Shatra family]. The two Shengo went through the motions of being astonished and frightened [Tib. ha las 'drogs 'gro ga byas song] and said, "What right do the [Ganden] monks have to meddle into this? Are they allowed to assemble like this? They are spoiled." [Tib. grwa pa la jus gtogs ga re yod red/ de 'dra 'tshog chog gi red pas/ skyag lang shor ba red]". Both of the Shengo were agitated and said, "We have to arrest them. They are spoiled, but it is not okay to punish them. It will not be okay if we fine them. You two Chagdampa should go and get them." [Tib. 'dzin 'chang gtong dgos/ bkod pa bshad na ni 'grig gi ma red/ nyes pa btang na gos chod kyi ma red/ phyag dam pa gnyis kyis khrid phebs]. There was a monk who had lost his celibacy and was staying in Gyambumgang [Tib. rje 'bum sgang] who said, "Shall I go? But the Shengo said "Wait a minute." and then they told me, "You take some switches and take 3-4 Geyog and go to arrest them and beat them with switches. If the matter is important bring them here. Otherwise, go ahead and settle it." At that time, I was the Ganden Tripa's liaison, so I said, "I have to go to escort the Ganden Tripa. Otherwise, he might report me to the gag." I didn't go and then I went to put om the padding on my shoulder [Tib. o bog]]. Then I saw a Geyog standing there so I told him, "Don't stand there like a beggar holding a staff. It is time to go." Actually, it was not time to go. The Ganden Tripa was from Tratsang Jey and was nicknamed "flower" [Tib. me tog lags]. His name was Lhundrup Tsündrü [Tib. lhun grub btson 'grus] and he was from Shang Ganden Chöngor [Tib. shangs dga' ldan chos 'khor]. When I went into Kapshöba's house, the Ganden Tripa had already put on his yellow hat and was ready to leave. He asked me, "Is it time to leave?" I said, "Yes." Then he told his servants in his Tsang dialect to serve him bag and he also told me to eat bag with him. They had made a meat stew to eat with the bag and they also served us thü. The Tripa told me, "Please do things well. There is a lot of talk going around [regarding Shatra] so please be careful. If not, there will be harm in the future [Tib. dga' bde gnang byed/ bshad sgra'i skor skas cha mang po 'dug/ phugs la skyon byed kyi red da]". He gave me good advice, right? So I said, "Thank you." After that I escorted the Tripa to the gelong's confessional assembly [Tib. sojong] and about an hour passed. After the gelong's confessional assembly, I was staying in the Shengo's office and then I escorted the Tripa back. I was coming through the back door to the small door of the chöra [Tib. gsung chos ra ba] when I saw a messenger going there. He stood there when he saw me and told me, "The gag told me to call you to the gag. I asked him, "Who is being called?" He said, "The Chagdampa. Kungö Nendrön from the gag told me to call you to come from the Shengo's office."  When I went there, the Nendrön was Gyambumgang and he said, "Tonight [the Dalai Lama and the regent will come to watch the tsenyi debate (Tib. thamsig [dam gzigs]). This was the gag's order. When I was coming near the door of the hall called Ewam, [Shingnyer Chönzin la] was coming and he asked me, "Did the gag call us? Shall I go." I said, "Yes, but you don't need to go. I already went there and the gag said that the Dalai Lama and the regent will come to watch the tsenyi debate." Then he said shall I call the Chabril and I said yes. He said, "You are like an old fisherman who does not listen and who does not get annoyed." [Tib. nyan rgyu med pa'i nya pa rgas po dang/ bsun rgu med pa'i nya pa rgas po]." [unclear]. The Dalai Lama is going to come to the evening prayer assembly. The ordinary monks are going to prostrate in front of the Dalai Lama outside the firewood yard (Tib. shingre gomchor [shing ra'i sgo mchor]). Now something very bad might happen (Tib. tha pe söyong [da dpe bzos yong]). unclear tape] [implies that the Ganden monks might do something]  When I went to the Shengo's office, the east side of Shengo's office was packed with people and among them there were the two managers (chandzö) of Shatra [the main family]: Gyala [Tib. rgyal lags] and Manithang [Tib. ma ni thang] and all of them. And there were about 20 some monastic officials (Tib. lene [las sne]) from Ganden Shartse [Tib. shar rtse] and Changtse [Tib. byang rtse] colleges. Tsag Serkhang's steward and those others were sitting at the west side. The two Shengo were sitting on chairs outside and a monk wearing the boots called garlo who had hair behind his ears [implies he was a dobdo] was being whipped with switches while I was standing there. They beat him about 50-60 times. Then there a tall and old monk was also beaten with switches. While beating him, the junior Shengo told the monk, "You tell me!" [Tib. shod jig kas]. Then the Shengo's slipper was taken off and the junior Shengo hit him on his cheek with the slipper and told him, "You tell me." Then I told the junior Shengo, "I am sorry, but don't beat him." At that time, he was agitated and asked me, "Don't I have the power to punish him? Ah Ah ! [Tib. ngar bkod pa shod yag gi dbang yod ma red pas] and the junior Shengo was rushing towards me and he was almost choking when yelling Ah Ah. He was almost going to beat me up. I was also short tempered and I was agitated and had to talk back to him and said, "Because you have the power to punish him, I am telling you "sorry." If you are not allowed to punish, there is no reason for you to be in this room and I don't need to tell you sorry. The reason I told you sorry is if you punish people not in accordance with the government's laws and the religious laws and if there would be some bad result without any reason, I thought all of us will be ruined. That's why I told you this." [Tib. rgyal khrims chos khrims dang ma mthun pa'i khrims gcod btang nas/ don med dgos med rkyen ngan 'dra byung na/ tshang ma 'phung yong bsam nas zhus pa yin]. Didn't the drunyichemmo of the Yigtsang give the order to all of us that we have to investigate the case. You Sir [Tib. sku zhabs] understand Tibetan, don't you? If you don't understand Tibetan, then there is nothing to do."  Then I told the person who was beating the monk, "Go ahead and Beat him severely! They did something that caused them to get this. We don't have anything to say. The lamas and the lords [the superiors] issued a long verdict with a seal at the bottom. I am not guilty and I don't have anything to hide, like hiding one's face under one's fingers and I don't have anything to lose. [whispering -- unclear]." Then the Shengo told them to lock them in the prison with wooden shackles [Tib. an tad] on their legs. [tape unclear] Then the junior Shengo told me, "You scolded me. Thank you. I am going to report this to the Drepung Laji" [Tib. ngar bka' bkyon gnang byung/ thugs rje che/ nga 'bras spungs bla spyir snyan seng zhu gi yin]. I said, "I am sorry, sir, I have something to report." He said, "What do you have to say?" Then I stood up and took out a khata and told him, "You scolded me and I talked back to you. Please cease your anger like the saying, "To cure the sore in the mouth inside the mouth itself" [Tib. kha nang gi rma de kha nang la gso ba gnang rogs gnang]. In case the sore in the mouth is not cured in the mouth, then go ahead and report this to the Drepung Laji, but the Drepung Laji can't give orders to the Ganden Laji. If you want to report it, you should report it to a higher authority [Tib. bla dpon gong ma]. It is like the saying, "It is better to wash your hands in clean water" [Tib. chu gtsang sa zhig la lag pa bkrus na dga' gi red]. He said, "What do you mean clean water?" I said, "Go ahead and report this to the gag or the yigtsang." When you report it you should say, "The Loseling Chagdampa didn't accept [Tib. ma brtsis] me, the Gomang Shengo, so please ask him why he didn't accept me." They will ask me and I will give them the answer." Then he said, "What are you going tell them?" I said, "I don't need to tell you what I am going to report. I am going to report where I ought to report. I am like an intestine which is white inside and also outside [Tib. rgyu ma phyi dkar nang dkar]. I don't have any reason to hide my face under my fingers. You report that the Chagdampa and the Shengo can not stay in one room and you can drive me out." He said, "Sir, I can't do that." I said, "If you can't, then keep quiet and I will report somewhere like washing hands in a clean water, because I am like one who has been chased to the corner of the room, so I would have to turn my face back [Tib. rtsig khug la bkar nas rtsig khug nas tshur kha slog]. So I won't feel regret even if I have to wear a white chupa [worn when exiled from Lhasa] because this is my karmic result from the past life [Tib. skye ba sngon ma'i sngon bsags]."  Then the Khamtsen gegen told me to keep quiet, but I said, "You shut up like a walnut! [Tib. rkub star kha 'dra po tshums]. I will prove it myself. It is like the saying, "I carry the bow because I know how to shoot [Tib. mda' shes nas gzhu khyer yod]. I know medicine and I brought the medicine bag [Tib. em chi shes nas sman khug sdog yod]." Then the senior shengo said, "On the case of the main and the branch Shatra families, the monastic officials of Drepung became humiliated (Tib. ngolo char [sngo lo 'phyar]." I said, "You are right" [unclear tape] Since then we didn't talk. Then I sent my gidru to buy a mutton carcass and tell them that I will pay for it tomorrow. Then wait for me near the gate of Gyambumgang Nendrön's house and I will come after the evening tea prayer session. Then I took a gyabden [gift/bribe] and a khata subshi [Tib. zub phyi] and after the evening tea prayers, I told the Geyog that I am going to the Nendrön's house.  I went to see Gyambumgang Nendrön, but the situation had changed and the [servant] said, "Kungö is there, but someone is with him." I told him please report I am here and when he came out, he said, "I made the report, he [Nendrön] said 'If you want to report something, you have to go to the gag and not here, this is my shag [house].'" So we didn't have anything to do and just before we went out of the outer gate, the servant called us [not clear who was with him --perhaps the Shingnyer] in. At that time, the Nendrön was alone. The Nendrön's servant used to be a servant of the Kalön Lama and he would put a cup and a ladle on a bucket of chang costing 4 tranka, and then we all would drink from one cup. Then the Nendrön asked what I am here for. When I gave him the khata scarf, he returned the khata right away to show displeasure [Tib. ma 'dod pa'i rnam 'gyur]. Then he asked, "Weren't you inside the Shatra household? You are very knowledgeable right? What happened?" I said "I was not in Shatra household." Then he said, "I heard that you were in Shatra household." [implies he was secretly in cahoots with the main family] And then he told me to sit down and they served me tea in a red cup. Then his attitude changed and he was slightly more friendly [Tib. ngo dkar du phyin song] and he said, "You are not to be blamed. What happened?" Then he bent his head and remained like that for about 2 minutes after which he said, "We can call the Shengo to the gag after the drungja is over." I said, "Thank you." He returned the khata scarf to me, but I gave him the khata again and told him, "If you call the Shengo to the gag, please tell them that we, the Chagdampa, are also coming to the gag." He said, "What are you going to do?" I said, "I will report whatever the Shengo did so that you will be clear about the matter." He said, "That will be good." It took a long time, like two hours, it was almost sunset, and then I went to the Shengo's office and the junior Shengo had become like a bear because he was agitated and didn't talk to me.   

**Q:**  At that time, were they still whipping people with switches?   

**A:**  The whippings were in the morning. I am talking about what happened in the evening.   

**Q:**  During this time, they stopped/blocked [Tib. bkag] the Shatra people, right?   

**A:**  Yes. When I came back, Tsag Serkhang's steward was there. While the two Shengo were there, I asked them did you put wooden shackles on them and they said they did. I said you don't need to put wooden shackles on them. After the Shengo left, I told them to open the door where the three monks were locked up and I told them to untie the wooden shackles. Then I told the monks, "Get up! What is there to be surprised about to have been beaten a little bit." Then I asked the Ganden Laji monks, "Are you the officials [lene} of the Ganden Laji?" They said yes. Then I said, "Why are you standing over there? If you are to make an appeal, just come in." Then I took them [the three] out and told them that I am handing over the three monks to you [the Ganden Laji officials] like fixing a needle to the collar [Tib. khab gong gzer]. Now they don't have any physical problem. [tape unclear]." Then they took over the three monks.  Then the junior Shengo told me, "You shouldn't have released them. You must lock them up." I said there is no place to lock them in." Then all of them came into the Shengo's office and then the Gowo steward came in. I knew the Gowo steward and I was also little close to him. I asked him what did you report? [tape unclear] Then all of them returned and when the evening tea [prayer session] was over, it was sunset. [Then I told the Ganden Chandzö, "Now, the case is settled like the proverb, "Didn't need to raise the cymbal in the sky as it was settled by ringing the bell." [Tib. sil snyan nam mkhar 'phyar mi dgos par dril bu ga ?'og nas grol ba] [means didn't need to get humiliated in the public]. I asked his name and whether he is from Changtse [Tib. byang rtse] or Shartse [tiv. shar rtse] College and I told him to write his name down. After the gongja [evening prayer session], it was almost sunset.  Then the junior Shengo asked me, "Where did you go today? We waited for you, but you didn't come [after the gongja], so we ate the food and have kept your food here." I said I went to Gyambumgang and they asked what was the matter? I said I went to borrow a horse. He said, "Wow, you borrowed a horse so early for the Champa Dendren [Tib. byams pa gdan 'dren] [which is held on the 25th after the Mönlam where they take the Maitreya Buddha's statue around in the Barkor.]" The next morning, a messenger was standing near the door of the Shengo's office so I asked him, "What are you here for?" He said, "The gag is calling you people." The Shengo asked, "What is the matter?" Then we went to the gag and they asked me what happened and I said, "The junior Shengo was beating a person with his slipper, so I held his hand and told him [talking like whispering] "Because you have the power to punish, I am telling you I am sorry. If you were not allowed to punish people, there is no reason for you to be in this room and I wouldn't want to tell you sorry." [tape unclear] Then he [the nendrön] was very angry and scolded the junior Shengo very severely saying, "That was ridiculous." [Tib. dpe srid dwogs med]." I kept quiet and didn't say sorry. [tape unclear] Then the nendrön told us, "Don't you Chagdampa and Shingnyer have to go now? You can go." And then the tsog was held and we came down and then the second tea was served and then the third tea.  [ When they did the tsenyi debate, the Shengo would sit on seats near the table where the people giving the gye would sit. At this time, when I went in, the Ganden monks were there and I banged my staff on the floor and told them, "What have you to say now? Is this all you are capable of? If you are not capable, you must stop doing this. You better control yourselves [Tib. mdog skya 'di red pas/ 'jon gi mi 'dug na zhogs dgos red/ sdug tshod zin na dga' ba yong]. I am white both inside and outside and I don't have anything to lose." Later I heard that the Ganden monks were saying, "That was about their internal problem, he didn't mean us."  [tape unclear] When we came back to the Shengo's office, they [he shengo ?] said, "Today, you scolded [the Ganden monks] a lot." Then I said, "If I didn't tell them a little bit it would be like the proverb, "The good-tempered people are regarded as idiots and a horse with a long chin looks like an old horse [Tib. mi blo rgyu ring na lkugs mthong dang rta ma le ring na rgan mthong]. Then Tsag Serkhang paid the Shengo 100 dotse [as a bribe]. And then the verdict was issued from the gag. It said that this can not be settled unless an investigator was appointed in the Shengo's office. So the case was not settled for about 2 years.  [in other words, the main family won the first round by stopping the Shengo from deciding in favor of Tsag Serkhang]  

**Q:**  Tsag Serkhang acted wantonly [Tib. hag tshal sba tshal] and married Lhayön la [Shatra's daughter], right?   

**A:**  Yes. They were in cahoots.   

**Q:**  It was said that the one who married Lhayön la was not the son of Tsag Serkhang, but he was Chapa Rusur, Lungshar's son, right?   

**A:**  And the Shengo supported them.   

**Q:**  And it was said that their opponent said that if someone could kill Chandzö Gyala, they will be paid 100 dotse, right?   

**A:**  Chandzö Gyala was arrested, but he was not beaten with switches.   

**Q:**  He was about to get whipped, right?   

**A:**  They didn't plan to whip him. They just said that they were going to [whip him].   

**Q:**  I heard that when Chandzö Gyala was about to get whipped with switches, the monks came and did something, right?   

**A:**  No, the monks didn't come and he was not about to get beaten. And then we [Shengo's office] were frightened and scattered (Tib. drog ne thor ['drogs nas 'thor])].   

**Q:**  What was the reason for the Shengo's office to have this internal fight? Was there anybody from above giving secret messages [Tib. gsang brda] to the Shengo's office?   

**A:**  There was nobody doing that. I didn't hear and see anything like that. It happened all of a sudden like the protector deity [Tib. chos skyong srung ma] did something.   

**Q:**  Then the Shatra case became like pending [Tib. nyal], right?   

**A:**  Yes.   

**Q:**  Nothing happened to the two Shengo, right?   

**A:**  Yes. Because the order (Tib. kagyur [bka' sgyur]) was issued. They divided the things. [unclear]   

**Q:**  Actually, that case was not a case that the Shengo could settle, right? They told the Shengo something pleasant sounding and the Shengo didn't comprehend it [Tib. mgo ma 'tshos pa], right?   

**A:**  Yes.   

**Q:**  It was not that the whole Ganden monastery was supporting the main Shatra family; it was like half, right?   

**A:**  Ganden was behind Shatra.   

**Q:**  Even if Shatra and Dewashung [the Tibetan government] were in confrontation, Ganden would always stand on Shatra's side.   

**A:**  The Shengo was behind Tsag Serkhang.   

**Q:**  If Tsag Serkhang married Shatra's daughter, Shatra would drive them out, right?   

**A:**  Yes.   

**Q:**  What was the name of Trimön's trader?   

**A:**  I don't know his name.   

**Q:**  What did you say the Khamba [trader] did to Gyambumgang?   

**A:**  Not Gyambumgang. They were asked whether they have the Shengo's permission to display the things for sale.   

**Q:**  Where did he display the things to sell?   

**A:**  He displayed them in Wongtö Shinga [Tib. 'ong stod zhing ga] [near Trimön's house] and he said he displayed their things in their own place.   

**Q:**  And then they got into the fight?   

**A:**  Yes. Then they said, "Eat shit."   

**Q:**  And then the Khamba was arrested and they beat him with switches and locked him up, right?   

**A:**  Yes.   

**Q:**  While they were locked up, the two Chagdampa went to apologize to Trimön, right?   

**A:**  Yes. And then we met Shügüpa [Tib. shud khud pa] and the two of us were left in Shügüpas house. However, because Shügüpa didn't come, the two of us came out and when the [Trimön] Shape came, [Trimön] he prostrated to us [saying] "The compassionate lord has come." [Tib. dpon po thugs rje chen po phebs byung].   

**Q:**  How many times did [he] prostrate?   

**A:**  Probably, [he] prostrated 5 or 6 times.   

**Q:**  You didn't have anything to apologize to him, right?   

**A:**  On that night, we were left like this, and on the next morning, Trimön Shape went to Reting Labrang and said that last night 21 tsogchen shengo came to arrest me, so please protect me. Reting might have told him something clever (Tib. mkhas po] so then Trimön Shape went to the Kashag and said that he reported this to the regent, but the regent being a child, doesn't know anything, so please Kashag, take care of me (Tib. dakpo kyönro nang [bdag po bskyon rogs gnang]). Reting, therefore, was agitated and I received a message to come to Reting's Labrang. I went to see Reting Rimpoche and he told me that Trimön has reported to the Kashag that 21 shengo came to his house, so it would be better if you people visited Trimön. Then we went to Reting Labrang and reported through the Reting's senior Dzasa and [Reting said] "There is nothing to be agitated about [because Trimön came to me not wearing his uniform, but wearing a dress of a mediator (Tib. druba [sgrub pa ba]) [unclear] .Moreover, he told the Kashag that the regent is a child and doesn't know anything. Later, Trimön became crazy and took a nun to the Barkor and he came to the Shengo's office through the runggang chemmo [kitchen] and said, "Tsogchen Shengo la, are you in." [laughter as this was totally inappropriate for a Shape].   

**Q:**  As for the Kalön Lama, after Gendün Chödar la [Tib. dge 'dun chos dar lags] died, Jayan Kyil Lobsang Samjo La ['jam dbyangs dkyil blo bzang bsam mchog lags] became the Kalön Lama. After him. it was Trekhang and then it was Temba Jayan [Tib. bstan pa 'jam dbyangs] and then there was the Trimön trouble and then what else happened during the Reting regency? Soon after that. Trimön resigned, right? After that, Langdün had to resign on the day of the Tsongjö's Sebang, right? How did that all happen?   

**A:**  I don't have anything to tell you about those.   

**Q:**  I heard that the abbots of the colleges [in Sendregasum] submitted a note with three points to the Kashag and the drungtsi in which it was written, "1. In Chamdo and other important places there was no real kalön staying and there was only a the joint doji dzasa appointed. This is not okay. A real kalön should stay there. 2. Regarding the reincarnation of the Dalai Lama, last year Nechung gave the prophecy that it was very good if a minister could go to China [Tib. ma ha tsi na'i yul], so if he would dare to go this year, that will be good, but nobody went. 3. The regent has been made inconvenient to do his work [Tib. mdzad dka'].  The abbots held the meeting in the Judeling [Tib. jus 'ding gling] house and made the note and submitted it to the Kashag and the drungtsi. Then the Kashag and the drungtsi met and said what does, "inconvenient to work" mean? There is no inconvenient caused by the Kashag and the drungtsi, and Trimön has decided to resign. Then the regent said that it is inconvenient for me to work. Didn't you hear how this happened?   

**A:**  I don't have anything to tell you about this.   

**Q:**  Langdün resigned in 1933, the Earth-Hare Year on the 29th of the 2nd lunar month. Probably they talked about this on the 25th-26th and then the abbots met. Anyway, on the day when the monks of the Changchuling [Tib. byang 'chub gling] sent the Lügong [Tib. glud 'gong], the two scapegoats bearing the ransom of the ruler on the 29th of the 2nd lunar month, the abbots still hadn't adjourned their meeting. Finally, the abbots walked to the place where Reting Rimpoche was staying.
