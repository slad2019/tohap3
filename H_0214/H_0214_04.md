**Q:**  What happened then?   

**A:**  I was under the ladder and I would have heard what they were talking about, but they had finished their conversation. I heard the junior <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. ཞལ་ངོ] 1. A junior officer in the traditional Tibetan Army in charge of a unit (platoon) of 25 soldiers (same as dingpön). 2. The two head disciplinary officials for all of Drepung Monastery and for the Mönlam Prayer Festival.">Shengo</span> tell Tsag Serkhang's steward Penjor [Tib. རྩག་སེར་ཁང་གཉེར་པ་དཔལ་འབྱོར], "Tomorrow, when the <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. མང་ཇ] The morning tea served to monks from all the monastic colleges at the main prayer assembly hall.">mangja</span> is over and we [Shengo] go to urinate, you must offer a <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. ཁ་བཏགས] A Tibetan ceremonial scarf given to lamas, visitors, etc.">khata</span> to the two Chagdampa and make the report. You should not say anything about the two of us having talked [Tib. ང་གཉིས་སྐད་ཆ་བྱུང་བ་ཤོད་རྒྱུ་ཡོད་མ་རེད]." The steward said, "Of course I will not say that and I will come tomorrow morning." Then they said, "probably, we might have to give something to the pockmarked one." [Tib. འབར་ཚག་ལ་ཇིག་དགོས་དྭོགས་མེད་ཨ].   

**Q:**  The reference to the "pockmarked," was you, right?   

**A:**  Yes, probably, [laughter] although they didn't mention my name. Then the junior <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. ཞལ་ངོ] 1. A junior officer in the traditional Tibetan Army in charge of a unit (platoon) of 25 soldiers (same as dingpön). 2. The two head disciplinary officials for all of Drepung Monastery and for the Mönlam Prayer Festival.">Shengo</span> said, "There is no need to do t<span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. ཞྭ་མོ; ch. 戴帽] 1. A regular hat, cap. 2. A common political slang term (label) used for people who were classified as class enemies or reactionaries. It was used politically as, &quot;They put the hat on him,&quot; or &quot;They never took his hat off.&quot;">hat</span> because there is no custom of doing like that." Their conversation was finishing. Then I was afraid that they might see me so I came back quickly. Then I coughed to make a signal and asked the <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. ཐབ་གཡོག] Monks or laymen who work as servants/manual laborers in kitchens (normally monastic kitchens).">thabyog</span>, "Who is over there? Somebody is talking. Go get them." The thabyog said, "Yes." and went there, but all of them had fled and the junior Shengo might have fled together. [laughter]. I know that the Shengo was with them, so I wouldn't try to chase them, right? Then I went into the Shengo's office and the senior Shengo told me, "Chagdampa la, what's the matter? You spoke loudly! [Tib. ག་རེ་འདུག། གསུང་ཞེད་པོ་ཅིག་བསྐྱོན་སོང]. I said, "Who knows! There were three people talking a lot in front of the ladder." He said, "Who were they?" I said, "I don't know because it was dark. I sent the thabyog to catch them, but they couldn't." Although he knew that the junior Shengo was there, he said, "It is strange. Who could they be? " I said, "I couldn't recognize them." Right at this time, the cushion on which the junior Shengo sat was empty. After 5 minutes, the junior Shengo came in and told me, "Sir! (Tib. གུཤོ [སྐུ་ཞབས]) What's the matter? You were yelling loudly! I said, "There were 3-4 people talking in front of the ladder and I told them to catch them, but they couldn't." Though he himself was among them, he said, "Who could they be?" I said I don't know. I couldn't recognize them." He said, "This is strange". The next morning, when the morning prayer session was over, <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. བཀྲས་མཐོང] The name of the aristocratic family of an important official.">Trendong</span>'s steward and Tsag Serkhang's steward Penjor La were already there in front of the Shengo's office. They saw me and did the polite greeting to me (Tib. <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. ཕྱག་འབུལ] A traditional greeting of respect involving putting the tips of one&#x27;s fingers together in front of one&#x27;s bent face/head and raising them.">chambö</span> shü [ཕྱག་འབུལ་ཞུས] and told me that they want to come in. I said, "Do you want to come in?" They said, "Yes." I told them to wait there. Then I told the Shengo, "Trendong's steward and Tsag Serkhang's steward Penjor La want to come in. The senior Shengo said, "That's strange. What are they here for? [Tib. ག་རེ་ཡིན་ན]. I said they want to come in. Then the Shengo called them in and then they took out a <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. ཁ་བཏགས] A Tibetan ceremonial scarf given to lamas, visitors, etc.">khata</span> scarf and made their report [about the dispute and the Ganden monks gathering to support the main <span class "tooltip" data-text "[tib. བཤད་སྒྲ] The name of the family of an important lay aristocratic official.">Shatra</span>=family]. The two Shengo went through the motions of being astonished and frightened [Tib. ཧ་ལས་འདྲོགས་འགྲོ་ག་བྱས་སོང] and སཻད, "What right do the [གནདེན] monks have to meddle into this? Are they allowed to assemble like this? They are spoiled." [Tib. གྲྭ་པ་ལ་ཇུས་གཏོགས་ག་རེ་ཡོད་རེད། དེ་འདྲ་འཚོག་ཆོག་གི་རེད་པས། སྐྱག་ལང་ཤོར་བ་རེད]". Both of the Shengo were agitated and སཻད, "We have to arrest them. They are spoiled, but it is not okay to punish them. It will not be okay if we fine them. You two Chagdampa should go and get them." [Tib. འཛིན་འཆང་གཏོང་དགོས། བཀོད་པ་བཤད་ན་ནི་འགྲིག་གི་མ་རེད། ཉེས་པ་བཏང་ན་གོས་ཆོད་ཀྱི་མ་རེད། ཕྱག་དམ་པ་གཉིས་ཀྱིས་ཁྲིད་ཕེབས]. There was a monk who had lost his celibacy and ཝས་སྟཡིང་ཨིན་གྱམབུམགང [Tib. རྗེ་འབུམ་སྒང] who said, "Shall I go? But the Shengo said "Wait a minute." and then they told me, "You take some switches and take 3-4 Geyog and go to arrest them and beat them with switches. If the matter is important bring them here. Otherwise, གོ་ཨཧེཨད and settle it." At that time, I was the <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. དགའ་ལྡན་ཁྲི་པ] The chief abbot of Ganden Monastery. He is considered to hold the throne of Tsongkapa, the founder of the Gelugpa sect.">Ganden Tripa</span>'s liaison, སོ་ཨི་སཻད, "I have to go to escort the Ganden Tripa. Otherwise, he might report me to the <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. འགག] The Secretariat Office of either the Dalai Lama (tib. ཙེ་གག [རྩེ་འགག]) or the Regent (tib. shö gag [ཞོལ་འགག]).">gag</span>." I didn't go and then I went to put om the padding on my shoulder [Tib. ཨོ་བོག]]. Then I saw a Geyog standing there so I told him, "Don't stand there like a beggar holding a staff. It is time to go." Actually, it was not time to go. The Ganden Tripa was from Tratsang <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. བྱེས] The name of one of the largest colleges in Sera Monastery. It was the college of Reting Rimpoche.">Jey</span> and was nicknamed "flower" [Tib. མེ་ཏོག་ལགས]. His name was Lhundrup Tsündrü [Tib. ལྷུན་གྲུབ་བཙོན་འགྲུས] and he was from Shang Ganden Chöngor [Tib. ཤངས་དགའ་ལྡན་ཆོས་འཁོར]. When I went into <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. ཀ་ཤོད་པ] A famous Tibetan aristocrat who was involved in many important political intrigues.">Kapshöba</span>'s house, the Ganden Tripa had already put on his yellow hat and was ready to leave. He asked me, "Is it time to leave?" I said, "Yes." Then he told his servants in his <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. གཙང] One of the major sub-areas of Tibet that is located in southwest Tibet. Its main city is Shigatse.">Tsang</span> dialect to serve him bag and he also told me to eat bag with him. They had made a meat stew to eat with the bag and they also served us thü. The Tripa told me, "Please do things well. There is a lot of talk going around [རེགརྡིང་ཤཏྲ] so please be careful. If not, there will be harm in the future [Tib. དགའ་བདེ་གནང་བྱེད། བཤད་སྒྲའི་སྐོར་སྐས་ཆ་མང་པོ་འདུག། ཕུགས་ལ་སྐྱོན་བྱེད་ཀྱི་རེད་ད]". He gave me good advice, right? So I said, "Thank you." After that I escorted the Tripa to the <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. དགེ་སློང] A monk who has taken the full set of vows.">gelong</span>'s confessional assembly [Tib. སོཇོང] and about an hour passed. After the gelong's confessional assembly, I was staying in the Shengo's office and then I escorted the Tripa back. I was coming through the back door to the small door of the <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. ཆོས་ར] The special grove (&quot;dharma grove&quot;) in monasteries where monks formally met to practice debating.">chöra</span> [Tib. གསུང་ཆོས་ར་བ] when I saw a messenger going there. He stood there when he saw me and ཏོལད་མེ, "The gag told me to call you to the gag. I asked him, "Who is being called?" He said, "The Chagdampa. Kungö Nendrön from the gag told me to call you to come from the Shengo's office." When I went there, the Nendrön was <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. རྒྱ་འབུམ་སྒང] A famous monk official of the Trunyichemmo rank.">Gyambumgang</span> and ཧེ་སཻད, "Tonight [ཐེ་དལཻ་ལམ and the regent will come to watch the <span class "tooltip" data-text "[tib. མཚན་ཉིད] Buddhist dialectics. This is taught after the six-year curriculum called düdra.">tsenyi</span>=debate=(Tib.=ཐམསིག=[དམ་གཟིགས]). This was the gag's order. When I was coming near the door of the hall called Ewam, [Shingnyer Chönzin la] was coming and he asked me, "Did the gag call us? Shall I go." I said, "Yes, but you don't need to go. I already went there and the gag said that the Dalai Lama and the regent will come to watch the tsenyi debate." Then he said shall I call the Chabril and I said yes. He said, "You are like an old fisherman who does not listen and who does not get annoyed." [Tib. ཉན་རྒྱུ་མེད་པའི་ཉ་པ་རྒས་པོ་དང། བསུན་རྒུ་མེད་པའི་ཉ་པ་རྒས་པོ]." [unclear]. The Dalai Lama is going to come to the evening prayer assembly. The ordinary monks are going to prostrate in front of the Dalai Lama outside the firewood yard (Tib. shingre <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. སྒོ་མཆོར] The area outside of the monastic assembly hall that is supported by tall pillars.">gomchor</span> [ཤིང་རའི་སྒོ་མཆོར]). Now something very bad might happen (Tib. tha pe söyong [ད་དཔེ་བཟོས་ཡོང]). unclear tape] [implies that the Ganden monks might do something] When I went to the Shengo's office, the east side of Shengo's office was packed with people and among them there were the two managers (chandzö) of Shatra [the main family]: Gyala [Tib. རྒྱལ་ལགས] and Manithang [Tib. མ་ནི་ཐང] and all of them. And there were about 20 some monastic officials (Tib. ལེནེ [ལས་སྣེ]) from Ganden Shartse [Tib. ཤར་རྩེ] and Changtse [Tib. བྱང་རྩེ] colleges. Tsag Serkhang's steward and those others were sitting at the west side. The two Shengo were sitting on chairs outside and a monk wearing the boots called garlo who had hair behind his ears [implies he was a dobdo] was being whipped with switches while I was standing there. They beat him about 50-60 times. Then there a tall and old monk was also beaten with switches. While beating him, the junior Shengo told the monk, "You tell me!" [Tib. ཤོད་ཇིག་ཀས]. Then the Shengo's slipper was taken off and the junior Shengo hit him on his cheek with the slipper and told him, "You tell me." Then I told the junior Shengo, "I am sorry, but don't beat him." At that time, he was agitated and asked me, "Don't I have the power to punish him? Ah Ah ! [Tib. ངར་བཀོད་པ་ཤོད་ཡག་གི་དབང་ཡོད་མ་རེད་པས] and the junior Shengo was rushing towards me and he was almost choking when yelling Ah Ah. He was almost going to beat me up. I was also short tempered and I was agitated and had to talk back to him and said, "Because you have the power to punish him, I am telling you "sorry." If you are not allowed to punish, there is no reason for you to be in this room and I don't need to tell you sorry. The reason I told you sorry is if you punish people not in accordance with the government's laws and the religious laws and if there would be some bad result without any reason, I thought all of us will be ruined. That's why I told you this." [Tib. རྒྱལ་ཁྲིམས་ཆོས་ཁྲིམས་དང་མ་མཐུན་པའི་ཁྲིམས་གཅོད་བཏང་ནས། དོན་མེད་དགོས་མེད་རྐྱེན་ངན་འདྲ་བྱུང་ན། ཚང་མ་འཕུང་ཡོང་བསམ་ནས་ཞུས་པ་ཡིན]. Didn't the <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. དྲུང་ཡིག་ཆེན་མོ] The title of the four heads of the Yigtsang Office (Ecclesiastics Office).">drunyichemmo</span> of the <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. ཡིག་ཚང] The highest office dealing with monastic and religious affairs in the traditional Tibetan government. It is often called the Ecclesiastic Office. It was headed by 4 fourth rank monk officials called Trunyichemmo. The senior Trunyichemmo was called Ta Lama.">Yigtsang</span> give the order to all of us that we have to investigate the case. You Sir [Tib. སྐུ་ཞབས] understand Tibetan, don't you? If you don't understand Tibetan, then there is nothing to do." Then I told the person who was beating the monk, "Go ahead and Beat him severely! They did something that caused them to get this. We don't have anything to say. The lamas and the lords [the superiors] issued a long verdict with a seal at the bottom. I am not guilty and I don't have anything to hide, like hiding one's face under one's fingers and I don't have anything to lose. [whispering -- unclear]." Then the Shengo told them to lock them in the prison with wooden shackles [Tib. ཨན་ཏད] on their legs. [tape unclear] Then the junior Shengo told me, "You scolded me. Thank you. I am going to report this to the Drepung <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. བླ་སྤྱི] The highest administrative council in large monasteries, like Drepung. It consisted of the Abbots, the Tshogchen Umdze, the Shengo and the Jiso. In Drepung it also included ex-abbots.">Laji</span>" [Tib. ངར་བཀའ་བཀྱོན་གནང་བྱུང། ཐུགས་རྗེ་ཆེ། ང་འབྲས་སྤུངས་བླ་སྤྱིར་སྙན་སེང་ཞུ་གི་ཡིན]. I said, "I am sorry, sir, I have something to report." He said, "What do you have to say?" Then I stood up and took out a khata and told him, "You scolded me and I talked back to you. Please cease your anger like the saying, "To cure the sore in the mouth inside the mouth itself" [Tib. ཁ་ནང་གི་རྨ་དེ་ཁ་ནང་ལ་གསོ་བ་གནང་རོགས་གནང]. In case the sore in the mouth is not cured in the mouth, then go ahead and report this to the Drepung Laji, but the Drepung Laji can't give orders to the Ganden Laji. If you want to report it, you should report it to a higher authority [Tib. བླ་དཔོན་གོང་མ]. It is like the saying, "It is better to wash your hands in clean water" [Tib. ཆུ་གཙང་ས་ཞིག་ལ་ལག་པ་བཀྲུས་ན་དགའ་གི་རེད]. He said, "What do you mean clean water?" I said, "Go ahead and report this to the gag or the yigtsang." When you report it you should say, "The <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. བློ་གསལ་གླིང] One of the main colleges in Drepung Monastery.">Loseling</span> Chagdampa didn't accept [Tib. མ་བརྩིས] me, the <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. སྒོ་མང] One of the large colleges in Drepung Monastery.">Gomang</span> Shengo, so please ask him why he didn't accept me." They will ask me and I will give them the answer." Then he said, "What are you going tell them?" I said, "I don't need to tell you what I am going to report. I am going to report where I ought to report. I am like an intestine which is white inside and also outside [Tib. རྒྱུ་མ་ཕྱི་དཀར་ནང་དཀར]. I don't have any reason to hide my face under my fingers. You report that the Chagdampa and the Shengo can not stay in one room and you can drive me out." He said, "Sir, I can't do that." I said, "If you can't, then keep quiet and I will report somewhere like washing hands in a clean water, because I am like one who has been chased to the corner of the room, so I would have to turn my face back [Tib. རྩིག་ཁུག་ལ་བཀར་ནས་རྩིག་ཁུག་ནས་ཚུར་ཁ་སློག]. So I won't feel regret even if I have to wear a white <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. ཕྱུ་པ] The traditional Tibetan men and women&#x27;s dress. It is like a robe that is tied at the waist. Both men and women wear such dresses, although they differ slightly in color and in style.">chupa</span> [worn when exiled from Lhasa] because this is my karmic result from the past life [Tib. སྐྱེ་བ་སྔོན་མའི་སྔོན་བསགས]." Then the Khamtsen <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. དགེ་རྒན] 1. Teacher in a school. 2. In monastic settings it also refers to an adult monk who acted as a guardian to a younger monk. In such cases, the younger monk typically lived in the gegen&#x27;s apartment (shag). In monasteries, however, it could also mean a real teacher, or the monk who served as the guarantor for a new monk.">gegen</span> told me to keep quiet, but I said, "You shut up like a walnut! [Tib. རྐུབ་སྟར་ཁ་འདྲ་པོ་ཚུམས]. I will prove it myself. It is like the saying, "I carry the bow because I know how to shoot [Tib. མདའ་ཤེས་ནས་གཞུ་ཁྱེར་ཡོད]. I know medicine and I brought the medicine bag [Tib. ཨེམ་ཆི་ཤེས་ནས་སྨན་ཁུག་སྡོག་ཡོད]." Then the senior shengo said, "On the case of the main and the branch Shatra families, the monastic officials of Drepung became humiliated (Tib. ngolo char [sngo lo 'phyar]." I said, "You are right" [unclear tape] Since then we didn't talk. Then I sent my <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. དགེ་ཕྲུག] 1. Student. 2. Disciple. 3. Commonly the name for monks living with a gegen or teacher. These are more like wards than real disciples.">gidru</span> to buy a mutton carcass and tell them that I will pay for it tomorrow. Then wait for me near the gate of Gyambumgang Nendrön's house and I will come after the evening tea prayer session. Then I took a <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. སྐྱབས་རྟེན] A gift given to a judge or official who was hearing a case to ask his help in settling it in one&#x27;s favor. Also a gift to an official when asking him to help one get a job.">gyabden</span> [gift/bribe] and a khata subshi [Tib. ཟུབ་ཕྱི] and after the evening tea prayers, I told the Geyog that I am going to the Nendrön's house. I went to see Gyambumgang Nendrön, but the situation had <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. 1. ཆང, 2. བྱང] 1. Tibetan locally brewed barley beer. 2. North; nomad areas north of Lhasa in Nagchuga Prefecture 3. ch. 厂 factory.">chang</span>ed and the [servant] said, "Kungö is there, but someone is with him." I told him please report I am here and when he came out, he said, "I made the report, he [Nendrön] said 'If you want to report something, you have to go to the gag and not here, this is my <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. 1. ཤག, 2. ཞག] 1. The apartment/room of a monk. 2. The butter fat that coagulates on the top of butter-tea when the tea is left to sit for some time. If the tea had been made with a lot of butter, this layer could be thick enough to scoop off and save to later sell or eat separately. The senior monks are usually served tea with a lot of shag.">shag</span> [house].'" So we didn't have anything to do and just before we went out of the outer gate, the servant called us [not clear who was with him --perhaps the Shingnyer] in. At that time, the Nendrön was alone. The Nendrön's servant used to be a servant of the <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. བཀའ་བློན] One of the heads of the Kashag [bka&#x27; shag] or Council of Ministers. There were usually 4 Kalön, although in the 1950s the number increased at various times to 6 or 7. The Kalön ministers made decisions collectively, and had no fixed term of office.">Kalön</span> Lama and he would put a cup and a ladle on a bucket of chang costing 4 <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. ཏམ་ཀ] A unit in the traditional Tibetan currency system that was equal to 4 sang.">tranka</span>, and then we all would drink from one cup. Then the Nendrön asked what I am here for. When I gave him the khata scarf, he returned the khata right away to show displeasure [Tib. མ་འདོད་པའི་རྣམ་འགྱུར]. Then he asked, "Weren't you inside the Shatra household? You are very knowledgeable right? What happened?" I said "I was not in Shatra household." Then he said, "I heard that you were in Shatra household." [implies he was secretly in cahoots with the main family] And then he told me to sit down and they served me tea in a red cup. Then his attitude changed and he was slightly more friendly [Tib. ངོ་དཀར་དུ་ཕྱིན་སོང] and he said, "You are not to be blamed. What happened?" Then he bent his head and remained like that for about 2 minutes after which he said, "We can call the Shengo to the gag after the <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. དྲུང་ཇ] The daily meeting of Tibetan government monk officials (tsedrung) at which tea was provided. However, unlike the collective meetings of monks in monasteries, there was no collective chanting of prayers at the Drungja. The event started at around 9 a.m. and lasted for about an hour. When the Tse ga (the Dalai Lama&#x27;s Secretariat) was in the Potala, it was held there, and when it was in the Norbulinga Summer Palace, it was held there. All monk officials in Lhasa were expected to attend.">drungja</span> is over." I said, "Thank you." He returned the khata scarf to me, but I gave him the khata again and told him, "If you call the Shengo to the gag, please tell them that we, the Chagdampa, are also coming to the gag." He said, "What are you going to do?" I said, "I will report whatever the Shengo did so that you will be clear about the matter." He said, "That will be good." It took a long time, like two hours, it was almost sunset, and then I went to the Shengo's office and the junior Shengo had become like a bear because he was agitated and didn't talk to me.   

**Q:**  At that time, were they still whipping people with switches?   

**A:**  The whippings were in the morning. I am talking about what happened in the evening.   

**Q:**  During this time, they stopped/blocked [Tib. བཀག] the <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. བཤད་སྒྲ] The name of the family of an important lay aristocratic official.">Shatra</span> people, right?   

**A:**  Yes. When I came back, Tsag Serkhang's steward was there. While the two <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. ཞལ་ངོ] 1. A junior officer in the traditional Tibetan Army in charge of a unit (platoon) of 25 soldiers (same as dingpön). 2. The two head disciplinary officials for all of Drepung Monastery and for the Mönlam Prayer Festival.">Shengo</span> were there, I asked them did you put wooden shackles on them and they said they did. I said you don't need to put wooden shackles on them. After the Shengo left, I told them to open the door where the three monks were locked up and I told them to untie the wooden shackles. Then I told the monks, "Get up! What is there to be surprised about to have been beaten a little bit." Then I asked the Ganden <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. བླ་སྤྱི] The highest administrative council in large monasteries, like Drepung. It consisted of the Abbots, the Tshogchen Umdze, the Shengo and the Jiso. In Drepung it also included ex-abbots.">Laji</span> monks, "Are you the officials [lene} of the Ganden Laji?" They said yes. Then I said, "Why are you standing over there? If you are to make an appeal, just come in." Then I took them [the three] out and told them that I am handing over the three monks to you [the Ganden Laji officials] like fixing a needle to the collar [Tib. ཁབ་གོང་གཟེར]. Now they don't have any physical problem. [tape unclear]." Then they took over the three monks. Then the junior Shengo told me, "You shouldn't have released them. You must lock them up." I said there is no place to lock them in." Then all of them came into the Shengo's office and then the Gowo steward came in. I knew the Gowo steward and I was also little close to him. I asked him what did you report? [tape unclear] Then all of them returned and when the evening tea [prayer session] was over, it was sunset. [Then I told the Ganden Chandzö, "Now, the case is settled like the proverb, "Didn't need to raise the cymbal in the sky as it was settled by ringing the bell." [Tib. sil snyan nam mkhar 'phyar mi dgos par dril bu ga ?'og nas grol ba] [means didn't need to get humiliated in the public]. I asked his name and whether he is from Changtse [Tib. བྱང་རྩེ] or Shartse [tiv. shar rtse] College and I told him to write his name down. After the <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. 1. ཀོང་ཕྱག, 2. དགོང་ཇ] 1. The manager of Kongpo Khamtsen in Drepung Monastery. 2. The evening prayer chanting meeting (in monasteries).">gongja</span> [evening prayer session], it was almost sunset. Then the junior Shengo asked me, "Where did you go today? We waited for you, but you didn't come [after the gongja], so we ate the food and have kept your food here." I said I went to <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. རྒྱ་འབུམ་སྒང] A famous monk official of the Trunyichemmo rank.">Gyambumgang</span> and they asked what was the matter? I said I went to borrow a horse. He said, "Wow, you borrowed a horse so early for the Champa Dendren [Tib. བྱམས་པ་གདན་འདྲེན] [which is held on the 25th after the Mönlam where they take the Maitreya Buddha's statue around in the Barkor.]" The next morning, a messenger was standing near the door of the Shengo's office so I asked him, "What are you here for?" He said, "The <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. འགག] The Secretariat Office of either the Dalai Lama (tib. ཙེ་གག [རྩེ་འགག]) or the Regent (tib. shö gag [ཞོལ་འགག]).">gag</span> is calling you people." The Shengo asked, "What is the matter?" Then we went to the gag and they asked me what happened and I said, "The junior Shengo was beating a person with his slipper, so I held his hand and told him [talking like whispering] "Because you have the power to punish, I am telling you I am sorry. If you were not allowed to punish people, there is no reason for you to be in this room and I wouldn't want to tell you sorry." [tape unclear] Then he [the <span class "tooltip" data-text "[tib. སྣེ་མགྲོན] The monk official in charge of the Regent&#x27;s Secretariat Office (shöga). He was the equivalent of the Lord Chamberlain in the Dalai Lama&#x27;s Secretariat.">nendrön</span>] was very angry and scolded the junior Shengo very severely saying, "That was ridiculous." [Tib. དཔེ་སྲིད་དྭོགས་མེད]." I kept quiet and didn't say sorry. [tape unclear] Then the nendrön told us, "Don't you Chagdampa and <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. ཤིང་གཉེར] The monk in charge of firewood at the Mönlam Prayer Festival.">Shingnyer</span> have to go now? You can go." And then the <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. ཚོགས] 1. A prayer assembly meeting in monasteries when all the monks come to an assembly hall and chant prayers together. 2. An offering made of tsamba, butter and dry cheese in the shape of a cone.">tsog</span> was held and we came down and then the second tea was served and then the third tea. [ When they did the tsenyi debate, the Shengo would sit on seats near the table where the people giving the gye would sit. At this time, when I went in, the Ganden monks were there and I banged my staff on the floor and told them, "What have you to say now? Is this all you are capable of? If you are not capable, you must stop doing this. You better control yourselves [Tib. མདོག་སྐྱ་འདི་རེད་པས། འཇོན་གི་མི་འདུག་ན་ཞོགས་དགོས་རེད། སྡུག་ཚོད་ཟིན་ན་དགའ་བ་ཡོང]. I am white both inside and outside and I don't have anything to lose." Later I heard that the Ganden monks were saying, "That was about their internal problem, he didn't mean us." [tape unclear] When we came back to the Shengo's office, they [he shengo ?] said, "Today, you scolded [the Ganden monks] a lot." Then I said, "If I didn't tell them a little bit it would be like the proverb, "The good-tempered people are regarded as idiots and a horse with a long chin looks like an old horse [Tib. མི་བློ་རྒྱུ་རིང་ན་ལྐུགས་མཐོང་དང་རྟ་མ་ལེ་རིང་ན་རྒན་མཐོང]. Then Tsag Serkhang paid the Shengo 100 <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. རྡོ་ཚད] A currency unit in traditional Tibet that was equal to 50 ngüsang.">dotse</span> [as a bribe]. And then the verdict was issued from the gag. It said that this can not be settled unless an investigator was appointed in the Shengo's office. So the case was not settled for about 2 years. [in other words, the main family won the first round by stopping the Shengo from deciding in favor of Tsag Serkhang]  

**Q:**  Tsag Serkhang acted wantonly [Tib. ཧག་ཚལ་སྦ་ཚལ] and married Lhayön la [Shatra's daughter], right?   

**A:**  Yes. They were in cahoots.   

**Q:**  It was said that the one who married Lhayön la was not the son of Tsag Serkhang, but he was Chapa Rusur, <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. ལུང་ཤར] The family name of a famous aristocratic lay official during the time of the 13th Dalai Lama and the Regent Reting.">Lungshar</span>'s son, right?   

**A:**  And the <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. ཞལ་ངོ] 1. A junior officer in the traditional Tibetan Army in charge of a unit (platoon) of 25 soldiers (same as dingpön). 2. The two head disciplinary officials for all of Drepung Monastery and for the Mönlam Prayer Festival.">Shengo</span> supported them.   

**Q:**  And it was said that their opponent said that if someone could kill Chandzö Gyala, they will be paid 100 <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. རྡོ་ཚད] A currency unit in traditional Tibet that was equal to 50 ngüsang.">dotse</span>, right?   

**A:**  Chandzö Gyala was arrested, but he was not beaten with switches.   

**Q:**  He was about to get whipped, right?   

**A:**  They didn't plan to whip him. They just said that they were going to [whip him].   

**Q:**  I heard that when Chandzö Gyala was about to get whipped with switches, the monks came and did something, right?   

**A:**  No, the monks didn't come and he was not about to get beaten. And then we [Shengo's office] were frightened and scattered (Tib. དྲོག་ནེ་ཐོར [འདྲོགས་ནས་འཐོར])].   

**Q:**  What was the reason for the <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. ཞལ་ངོ] 1. A junior officer in the traditional Tibetan Army in charge of a unit (platoon) of 25 soldiers (same as dingpön). 2. The two head disciplinary officials for all of Drepung Monastery and for the Mönlam Prayer Festival.">Shengo</span>'s office to have this internal fight? Was there anybody from above giving secret messages [Tib. གསང་བརྡ] to the Shengo's office?   

**A:**  There was nobody doing that. I didn't hear and see anything like that. It happened all of a sudden like the protector deity [Tib. ཆོས་སྐྱོང་སྲུང་མ] did something.   

**Q:**  Then the <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. བཤད་སྒྲ] The name of the family of an important lay aristocratic official.">Shatra</span> case became like pending [Tib. ཉལ], right?   

**A:**  Yes.   

**Q:**  Nothing happened to the two <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. ཞལ་ངོ] 1. A junior officer in the traditional Tibetan Army in charge of a unit (platoon) of 25 soldiers (same as dingpön). 2. The two head disciplinary officials for all of Drepung Monastery and for the Mönlam Prayer Festival.">Shengo</span>, right?   

**A:**  Yes. Because the order (Tib. ཀགྱུར [བཀའ་སྒྱུར]) was issued. They divided the things. [unclear]   

**Q:**  Actually, that case was not a case that the <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. ཞལ་ངོ] 1. A junior officer in the traditional Tibetan Army in charge of a unit (platoon) of 25 soldiers (same as dingpön). 2. The two head disciplinary officials for all of Drepung Monastery and for the Mönlam Prayer Festival.">Shengo</span> could settle, right? They told the Shengo something pleasant sounding and the Shengo didn't comprehend it [Tib. མགོ་མ་འཚོས་པ], right?   

**A:**  Yes.   

**Q:**  It was not that the whole Ganden monastery was supporting the main <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. བཤད་སྒྲ] The name of the family of an important lay aristocratic official.">Shatra</span> family; it was like half, right?   

**A:**  Ganden was behind Shatra.   

**Q:**  Even if <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. བཤད་སྒྲ] The name of the family of an important lay aristocratic official.">Shatra</span> and Dewashung [the Tibetan government] were in confrontation, Ganden would always stand on Shatra's side.   

**A:**  The <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. ཞལ་ངོ] 1. A junior officer in the traditional Tibetan Army in charge of a unit (platoon) of 25 soldiers (same as dingpön). 2. The two head disciplinary officials for all of Drepung Monastery and for the Mönlam Prayer Festival.">Shengo</span> was behind Tsag Serkhang.   

**Q:**  If Tsag Serkhang married <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. བཤད་སྒྲ] The name of the family of an important lay aristocratic official.">Shatra</span>'s daughter, Shatra would drive them out, right?   

**A:**  Yes.   

**Q:**  What was the name of <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. ཁྲི་སྨོན] The name of the aristocratic family of an important lay official .">Trimön</span>'s trader?   

**A:**  I don't know his name.   

**Q:**  What did you say the <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. ཁམས་པ] A person from the Kham region, a Tibetan from the Khamba (Khampa) sub-cultural group.">Khamba</span> [trader] did to <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. རྒྱ་འབུམ་སྒང] A famous monk official of the Trunyichemmo rank.">Gyambumgang</span>?   

**A:**  Not Gyambumgang. They were asked whether they have the <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. ཞལ་ངོ] 1. A junior officer in the traditional Tibetan Army in charge of a unit (platoon) of 25 soldiers (same as dingpön). 2. The two head disciplinary officials for all of Drepung Monastery and for the Mönlam Prayer Festival.">Shengo</span>'s permission to display the things for sale.   

**Q:**  Where did he display the things to sell?   

**A:**  He displayed them in Wongtö Shinga [Tib. འོང་སྟོད་ཞིང་ག] [near Trimön's house] and he said he displayed their things in their own place.   

**Q:**  And then they got into the fight?   

**A:**  Yes. Then they said, "Eat shit."   

**Q:**  And then the <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. ཁམས་པ] A person from the Kham region, a Tibetan from the Khamba (Khampa) sub-cultural group.">Khamba</span> was arrested and they beat him with switches and locked him up, right?   

**A:**  Yes.   

**Q:**  While they were locked up, the two Chagdampa went to apologize to <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. ཁྲི་སྨོན] The name of the aristocratic family of an important lay official .">Trimön</span>, right?   

**A:**  Yes. And then we met Shügüpa [Tib. ཤུད་ཁུད་པ] and the two of us were left in Shügüpas house. However, because Shügüpa didn't come, the two of us came out and when the [Trimön] <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. ཞབས་པད] One of the heads of the Kashag [bka&#x27; shag] or Council of Ministers. There were usually 4 Shape or Kalön, although in the 1950s the number increased at various times to 6 or 7. The ministers made decisions collectively and had no fixed term of office.">Shape</span> came, [Trimön] he prostrated to us [saying] "The compassionate <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. དཔོན་པོ, མངའ་བདག] 1. A manorial estate holder. 2. Chief of an area.">lord</span> has come." [Tib. དཔོན་པོ་ཐུགས་རྗེ་ཆེན་པོ་ཕེབས་བྱུང].   

**Q:**  How many times did [he] prostrate?   

**A:**  Probably, [he] prostrated 5 or 6 times.   

**Q:**  You didn't have anything to apologize to him, right?   

**A:**  On that night, we were left like this, and on the next morning, <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. ཁྲི་སྨོན] The name of the aristocratic family of an important lay official .">Trimön</span> Shape went to Reting Labrang and said that last night 21 <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. ཚོགས་ཆེན] The main assembly hall of a monastery. The assembly hall for the monastery as a whole.">tsogchen</span> shengo came to arrest me, so please protect me. Reting might have told him something clever (Tib. མཁས་པོ] so then Trimön Shape went to the Kashag and said that he reported this to the regent, but the regent being a child, doesn't know anything, so please Kashag, take care of me (Tib. <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. དྭགས་པོ] A region in Southern Tibet.">dakpo</span> kyönro nang [བདག་པོ་བསྐྱོན་རོགས་གནང]). Reting, therefore, was agitated and I received a message to come to Reting's Labrang. I went to see Reting Rimpoche and he told me that Trimön has reported to the Kashag that 21 shengo came to his house, so it would be better if you people visited Trimön. Then we went to Reting Labrang and reported through the Reting's senior Dzasa and [Reting said] "There is nothing to be agitated about [because Trimön came to me not wearing his uniform, but wearing a dress of a mediator (Tib. དྲུབ [སྒྲུབ་པ་བ]) [unclear] .Moreover, he told the Kashag that the regent is a child and doesn't know anything. Later, Trimön became crazy and took a nun to the <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. བར་སྐོར] The inner circumambulation road that goes around the Tsuglagang (Jokhang) Temple in Lhasa. This circular road was a main market area.">Barkor</span> and he came to the <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. ཞལ་ངོ] 1. A junior officer in the traditional Tibetan Army in charge of a unit (platoon) of 25 soldiers (same as dingpön). 2. The two head disciplinary officials for all of Drepung Monastery and for the Mönlam Prayer Festival.">Shengo</span>'s office through the runggang <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. ཆེན་མོ] 1. Abbr. of the name of the Dalai Lama&#x27;s Lord Chamberlain (Drönyerchemmo). 2. Title for the highest status craftsmen in traditional Tibet.">chemmo</span> [kitchen] and said, "Tsogchen Shengo la, are you in." [laughter as this was totally inappropriate for a Shape].   

**Q:**  As for the <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. བཀའ་བློན] One of the heads of the Kashag [bka&#x27; shag] or Council of Ministers. There were usually 4 Kalön, although in the 1950s the number increased at various times to 6 or 7. The Kalön ministers made decisions collectively, and had no fixed term of office.">Kalön</span> Lama, after Gendün Chödar la [Tib. དགེ་འདུན་ཆོས་དར་ལགས] died, Jayan Kyil Lobsang Samjo La ['jam dbyangs dkyil blo bzang bsam mchog lags] became the Kalön Lama. After him. it was Trekhang and then it was Temba Jayan [Tib. བསྟན་པ་འཇམ་དབྱངས] and then there was the <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. ཁྲི་སྨོན] The name of the aristocratic family of an important lay official .">Trimön</span> trouble and then what else happened during the Reting regency? Soon after that. Trimön resigned, right? After that, <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. གླང་མདུན] The name of the family of the 13th Dalai Lama.">Langdün</span> had to resign on the day of the <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. ཚོགས་མཆོད] The large religious prayer festival held in Lhasa in the 2nd Tibetan lunar month.">Tsongjö</span>'s Sebang, right? How did that all happen?   

**A:**  I don't have anything to tell you about those.   

**Q:**  I heard that the abbots of the colleges [in Sendregasum] submitted a note with three points to the Kashag and the <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. དྲུང་རྩིས] The drunyichemmo and the tsipön.">drungtsi</span> in which it was written, "1. In Chamdo and other important places there was no real kalön staying and there was only a the joint <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. མདོ་སྤྱི] The governor-general of Eastern Tibet who was based in Chamdo. It is an abbreviation of dome jigyab [tib. མདོ་སྨད་སྤྱི་ཁྱབ].">doji</span> dzasa appointed. This is not okay. A real kalön should stay there. 2. Regarding the reincarnation of the Dalai Lama, last year <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. གནས་ཆུང] 1. One of the main protector deities of the Tibetan government and the Dalai Lama. 2. The monastery in which the medium of Nechung resides that is located just east of Drepung Monastery.">Nechung</span> gave the prophecy that it was very good if a minister could go to China [Tib. མ་ཧ་ཙི་ནའི་ཡུལ], so if he would dare to go this year, that will be good, but nobody went. 3. The regent has been made inconvenient to do his work [Tib. མཛད་དཀའ]. The abbots held the meeting in the Judeling [Tib. ཇུས་འདིང་གླིང] house and made the note and submitted it to the Kashag and the drungtsi. Then the Kashag and the drungtsi met and said what does, "inconvenient to work" mean? There is no inconvenient caused by the Kashag and the drungtsi, and <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. ཁྲི་སྨོན] The name of the aristocratic family of an important lay official .">Trimön</span> has decided to resign. Then the regent said that it is inconvenient for me to work. Didn't you hear how this happened?   

**A:**  I don't have anything to tell you about this.   

**Q:**  <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. གླང་མདུན] The name of the family of the 13th Dalai Lama.">Langdün</span> resigned in 1933, the Earth-Hare Year on the 29th of the 2nd lunar month. Probably they talked about this on the 25th-26th and then the abbots met. Anyway, on the day when the monks of the Changchuling [Tib. བྱང་འཆུབ་གླིང] sent the Lügong [Tib. གླུད་འགོང], the two scapegoats bearing the ransom of the ruler on the 29th of the 2nd lunar month, the abbots still hadn't adjourned their meeting. Finally, the abbots walked to the place where Reting Rimpoche was staying.
