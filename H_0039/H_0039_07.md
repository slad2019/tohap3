### Tape 7  
**A:**  It was decided [for Tibetans in Lhasa] to demonstrate on the 12th day of the Tibetan lunar calendar, and the preparations were done and the messages were sent on the 11th. We also gave dayan to all the beggars led by the ragyaba, the people who take the corpses of the beggars to the sky burial [site]. However, at dawn on the 12th, canons were shot [by the Chinese], so they didn't get the chance to demonstrate. Then Ala ran away from Kündeling [Tib. kun bde gling], and he tried to take Künsang La [Tib. kun bzang lags], though Künsang La didn't have thoughts of running away. She said, "It is not alright to run away. Even if I were killed [if I stayed], this is my karmic fate. I am not going to run away." Then Ala ran away. That's what happened until 1959. Then I ran away through Mön Tawang [Tib. rta dbang] and stayed in Missamari in India. After that, I stayed in Kalimpong and made my own living for a month. After that, when the Dalai Lama came to Mussoorie, I was granted a third audience with the Dalai Lama. Since then [after that], I was told to stay in Mussoorie. My first work was to write down what the Chinese said on the radio and report it to the Kashag.   

**Q:**  What happened to Künsang la later on?   

**A:**  I have a tape about that. I will make a copy of it. Give me two blank tapes.
