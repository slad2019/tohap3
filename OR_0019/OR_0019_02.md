**Q:**  In your previous interview, you told us about the things that happened after the reforms. Please tell us about your experiences in the old society from your childhood and about going after donkeys and so on. Your brother told us about handing over the donkeys to you.   

**A:**  It was my father. When I was eleven or twelve years old I grazed sheep. At that time, our household was a big one and we had two gang of land. One was a military gang [tib. magang] and the other gang was for sending corvée horses and pack animals. It was called a durgang. Sometimes, when they sent other people to herd the sheep, I went to herd the female dzo in the pastures.   

**Q:**  Please tell us about your family and about your parents. You were a treba household, right?   

**A:**  Yes, we had to work hard for the magang and the durgang land we held. From generation to generation, our household was a big treba household.   

**Q:**  How many khe of land did you have?   

**A:**  We had about eighty khe. We had to do a lot of corvée tax work and pay a lot of taxes like the taxes called monggö. This was a tax requiring us to deliver tsamba and grain to Lhasa. So we had serious hardships regarding our livelihood.   

**Q:**  Did your family members do the farming on those eighty khe of land?   

**A:**  Yes, we did.   

**Q:**  Did you have many family members at that time?   

**A:**  We had about fifteen family members. I had a lot of brothers and sisters. We had only one servant, a child who did sheep herding. Otherwise, all the work was done by our family members.   

**Q:**  Didn't you have servants at home?   

**A:**  We had only a child servant for herding sheep. We had taken loans from aristocrats and monastic estates that were passed down from generation to generation. The principal of the loans remained forever. Supposing the principal was five khe, we had to pay two khe in interest every year. Paying the interest was endless. And we had to send a soldier for the magang of land and pay him a salary of eighteen khe as well as an allowance for the soldier's summer clothing and winter clothing.   

**Q:**  What was the living standard in Sogang [his home area]?   

**A:**  Our living standard was lower middle standard. Our household was like a big empty one and the livelihood was not that good. From the former generations, we were not rich and there was a lot of cogon grass growing in the fields. The yields were not like nowadays. In those days, we used human excrement and animal dung as fertilizer, but we didn't have chemical fertilizers like nowadays. Comparing the yields, the yields from one field now are better than five fields in the past.   

**Q:**  Did you drink beer every day?   

**A:**  Yes.   

**Q:**  Did you eat meat often?   

**A:**  We didn't have much meat. We had beer to drink every day, but we were not drinking it so much to get drunk. We were just drinking beer to quench our thirst when we were working.   

**Q:**  How was the quality of the beer?   

**A:**  The quality was worse than nowadays. The livelihood is much better at the present time. Now we have plenty of grain and vegetables. In those days, we didn't have vegetables in the winter.   

**Q:**  Did you have butter tea often in the [old] society?   

**A:**  We had butter tea because we had many cows and the pastures were good.   

**Q:**  When you were young, how many cows and female dzo did you have?   

**A:**  We had four female dzos and two cows. We had butter tea to drink, but sometimes it was good and sometimes not.   

**Q:**  Did you have sheep and goats?   

**A:**  We had about thirty to forty sheep and goats.   

**Q:**  Did you milk the sheep and goats?   

**A:**  No we didn't.   

**Q:**  You had four dzos and two cows to milk, right?   

**A:**  Yes. In some years we had all of them to milk and in some years we had only two to milk.   

**Q:**  Was the butter you got from your dzos and cows enough for your use or did you have to buy butter from outside?   

**A:**  We didn't buy butter from outside. In those days, during the summer we had to pay a tax called the ngotre where we had to deliver butter to the local landlord and the lama who was protecting the crops from hail.   

**Q:**  Was that a tax or did you deliver it voluntarily?   

**A:**  It was a tax. During the summer, the sweepers and gyewo in Düjung county would come to beg for dairy products and wool, and we had to give them butter, wool and goat hair.   

**Q:**  Did you have to pay barley as a tax?   

**A:**  Yes, we had to pay a little barley as a tax. That was the monggö barley tax used for fodder for the horses of the Tibetan government.   

**Q:**  Did you have to do ula work?   

**A:**  Yes, we had to work a lot for four estates.   

**Q:**  Did you have to send a person every day to work as an ula?   

**A:**  We had to send two pairs of dzos to plow the fields that belonged to the Mönkhar [tib. smon mkhar] estate and we had to do all the farm work on the fields that we plowed there. We had to add earth and transport fertilizer to the fields. In the fifth month, we also had to bring sheep to the estate to collect fertilizer for half a month. When we collected the earth and the fertilizer, each household had to send three to four donkeys and two to three people. We had a larger area of land than other households, so we had to send four people. That was for the durgang (of land). We had to transport hay and barley with six donkeys and one mule from the estate to Düjung County.   

**Q:**  Was this the only estate for which you had to do ula?   

**A:**  There were two other estates that belonged to Düjung County.   

**Q:**  Did you have to go to the Phushi estate also? It is a long way.   

**A:**  We had some small fields in Phushi, so we had to work on those, but we used to hire other people living near there to do the farming. The treba had to transport the hay and barley produced from that estate to Düjung county. There was another estate called Tshaglung. We didn't have fields in that place, but we had to transport the hay and the barley produced from that estate to Düjung county. This estate was the main one and we had to plow the fields with four dzo and do the threshing work, transport the hay and barley, and accumulate the earth and fertilizer.   

**Q:**  Did you have to send ula workers during the non-farming seasons, like in the winter?   

**A:**  No, we didn't need to go during the winter. We had to water the fields and let it freeze [tib. 'khyag chu] during the winter.   

**Q:**  When you went to work as an ula worker, did they give you food?   

**A:**  Let alone giving food, when the county head came to this place, the morangga households had to go to work assisting the cook and (horse) groom [tib. rta g.yog]. The treba households didn't need to do that.   

**Q:**  When you treba went to do ula work for farming on those estates, did they give you food?   

**A:**  We had to bring our own food.   

**Q:**  When you did the farm work for the estate, how did you manage to do your own farm work like harvesting?   

**A:**  We had many family members, so some of us would go to work for the estate and some of us would do our own farming.   

**Q:**  Could you finish the work?   

**A:**  Yes, we could barely manage to finish it. We didn't have machines, but we were just doing it slowly. We were carrying things in baskets. Some of the bigger households couldn't finish their threshing even by the time of the New Year. These days, the threshing is finished in fifteen to sixteen days. The threshing would be done until the Ganden Ngamjö when people offered many butter lamps.   

**Q:**  You were a shungyuba treba household, so did you have to send corvée horses and pack animals?   

**A:**  Yes. We had to transport loads of juniper trees from Tingkye [tib. gting skyes shug dod]. These were used for making incense. Also when the messengers [tib. a drung] from the Regiment came from Lhasa carrying their travel documents, they would impose the tau corvée tax. If we had horses, we had to send the horses and if we didn't have horses, we had to borrow horses and send them for the tax. We had to take them to the next transport station.   

**Q:**  Was that tax heavy or was it not so bad?   

**A:**  That was not so heavy, though we had to send a horse and a person to take the horse back. There were many different kinds of taxes.   

**Q:**  What were you doing during the whole day when you were young?   

**A:**  Up to when I was about ten years old, I was just playing and wandering around. I didn't have any work at that time. From the age of ten, I was herding sheep and grazing dzo in the upper part of the valley. When I was age eleven to thirteen, I went to a school to learn writing and reading.   

**Q:**  Where did you go to learn this?   

**A:**  I went to learn writing and reading from my maternal uncle.   

**Q:**  Did he live in this place?   

**A:**  He was in Kyinkar [tib. dkyil mkhar] in Gyantse. That was my mother's home. When I was sixteen, I went to Phari to work for the family transporting wool.   

**Q:**  Were you sent alone to the school?   

**A:**  Yes, I was alone. The teacher was my maternal uncle.   

**Q:**  What was the purpose of sending you to school? Was that because you were smarter?   

**A:**  No. It was not because I was smart. It was in order for the elder son to become the household head [tib. za yon]. They taught the younger children a little bit of writing, but I was sent to the school for the purpose of becoming the household head. We had to perform many kinds of taxes and corvée labor, so the household head should know writing and reading.   

**Q:**  How did they teach you writing and reading?   

**A:**  In the beginning, they would teach writing the letters of the alphabet and the suffixes and the vowels on a wooden board. After that, he taught me the next size smaller letters that was called Tsugjen. Then he taught me to write on very bad quality paper made from wood.   

**Q:**  What would you do during the whole day from the morning to evening in the school?   

**A:**  In the morning, I would recite prayers.   

**Q:**  Were you alone at that time?   

**A:**  Yes. I would get up at around seven in the morning and recite prayers, like the prayers for the Goddess Tara and the bar chad lam sel prayer which was for Padmasambhava. Then I would practice reading. After breakfast, I would practice writing on the wooden board five to six times.   

**Q:**  Did your uncle provide food?   

**A:**  My uncle gave me tea and tsamba soup, and I had brought my own tsamba. I didn't have as much tsamba as I wanted to eat. I had a small bag of tsamba which was supposed to be eaten in six days. I had a big spoon in the bag and I would eat five spoons in the morning, three spoons at midday and five spoons in the evening.  My uncle had quite a lot of animals to be milked because there were good pastures there. So they had a lot of buttermilk and they would give me some buttermilk and I would eat it with my tsamba.   

**Q:**  Wasn't five spoonfuls too little for you? How big was the spoon?   

**A:**  It was so big . In the beginning, that was not enough for me. But later I got used to it and it was just enough for me, though I felt a little bit hungry because we didn't have enough food to be full like nowadays. That was the fixed amount of food that I had to eat.   

**Q:**  When you ate five spoons of tsamba, did the tsamba fill this size bowl?   

**A:**  Yes, it was something like that and there was also some tsamba soup with it. In midday, they would give me two bowls of buttermilk and I would add three spoons of tsamba and eat it.   

**Q:**  You were eating it kind of in a pasty consistency, right?   

**A:**  Yes.   

**Q:**  When you were staying home, did they control your diet like that?   

**A:**  No, there wasn't any control. I could eat as much as I wanted.  In the evening, my uncle would give me tsamba soup and I would mix some buttermilk with five spoons of tsamba and eat it with bowls of tsamba soup. It was barely enough in the evening. In the morning, the food was not quite enough.   

**Q:**  When you were living with your uncle, did you have to work?   

**A:**  Yes. I was learning writing and also doing work like harvesting and grazing donkeys and lambs during the spring. I also had to collect dung. This work was like a sideline and my main time was used for studying.   

**Q:**  When your uncle was teaching you writing, did he stay with you all the time or would he go to work and arrange your study?   

**A:**  Yes. He arranged my studies and after I had finished writing, I would show it to him. When the elder uncle was out, there were some younger uncles who also taught me writing. When there was something wrong, the teacher would hit me on the head with the wooden writing board. I could write carefully one full wooden board to be shown to the teacher and go to play for a while. Anyway, the teacher made me suffer quite seriously.   

**Q:**  You would get up at seven and do the prayers, right?   

**A:**  Yes, and I would also recite the nine times table [tib. dgu mtha' cha phran] and the fractions in the morning.   

**Q:**  What time did you eat your breakfast?   

**A:**  That was probably around 10 o'clock.   

**Q:**  What did you do after that?   

**A:**  Then I had to practice writing.   

**Q:**  Did you have to write every day?   

**A:**  When there were some important things to do, I had to do that. Otherwise, I had to practice writing every day. My uncle also sent me to dig irrigation canals as his ula worker.   

**Q:**  At that time, what did you think? Did you think that it was better for you to learn writing and were you kind of proud or did you think you would be happier to stay home?   

**A:**  Nowadays, when I can read the scriptures, I think it was good for me that I had learned the reading, and I have faith towards learning reading. I think I am grateful to my teacher. Otherwise, at that time, I didn't want to learn writing. I liked to play with other children outside. Especially when the teacher hit my head with the wooden board, I didn't want to learn writing. I liked to work.   

**Q:**  When you were learning writing and reading, did other people admire you?   

**A:**  They did not admire me.   

**Q:**  After you finished studying, were you able to read religious texts?   

**A:**  Yes, I was able to read them.   

**Q:**  Were you able to write in the cursive script?   

**A:**  Yes, I could write a little bit. I didn't have a good memory.   

**Q:**  Did you stay in school for three years?   

**A:**  Yes.   

**Q:**  What was your standard when you finished the school?   

**A:**  My standard was quite high. From the ages fourteen to sixteen I went to herd sheep. At that time, I was thinking about fooling around and acting naughty. I also was worried and felt sad about the economic condition of my family.   

**Q:**  When the People's Liberation Army came to Lhasa and Gyantse, what were you thinking about in your family?   

**A:**  I didn't have any thoughts about that. Just before that, they implemented the loan investigation [tib. bun zhib]. I am not sure whether that was because of the revolution [socialist reforms] or if it was done by the old government. They investigated the old loans where the five khe principal still remained after paying two khe interest every year. It was decided that people would not be allowed to collect that kind of interest and they made a new payment arrangement and reduced the interest.   

**Q:**  When was that? Was that after you finished school?   

**A:**  That was when I was eighteen or nineteen years old. Before that, there was twenty percent [tib. lnga drug 'gro] and fourteen percent [tib. bdun brgyad skyed] interest. They reduced the interest and arranged the payment of the principal to a certain number of years to the aristocrats and the monasteries. Just after that, the uprising took place.   

**Q:**  When you were fifteen to seventeen years old, the People's Liberation Army had already arrived in Tibet. Did you know about that?   

**A:**  At that time, there was no People's Liberation Army. When I was eighteen, they did the loan investigation.   

**Q:**  Did the Chinese come to investigate the loans or were they Tibetans?   

**A:**  It was probably done by both sides. In this place, our people did the investigation and the revolution [coming of Chinese] had probably already taken place in the Tibet Autonomous Region.   

**Q:**  Were there people from the Tibetan government doing the investigation?   

**A:**  There was the Tibetan government. Probably they cooperated and did the investigation. That was probably the time when they signed the Seventeen Point Agreement.   

**Q:**  When the loan investigation was done, was the Tibetan government still there?   

**A:**  Yes, it was still there and the uprising was also probably in the Tibet Autonomous Region and they did it together. About three to four years after the loan investigation, a kind of uprising took place.   

**Q:**  What did you think when the loan investigation was done? Were you happy?   

**A:**  Yes. I was glad because before that we didn't have any end for repaying the loan, but the investigation made a new payment arrangement and reduced the interest.   

**Q:**  When the loan investigation was done, how much in loans did your family have to pay?   

**A:**  We had a lot of loans to be paid so they made the new payment arrangement. At that time, my father was alive. The elderly were saying that the loan investigation was very good because it would lessen the burden on their children. The interest was twenty percent and fourteen percent and they made the payment arrangement and exempted the interest. Our loans were supposed to be cleared up in four years. Before the loan was cleared up, the revolution took place [1959]. I was just working in the household and I didn't have any responsibilities. When the revolution [Chinese] came they were marching, and beating drums and playing cymbals. I became the household head of our family.   

**Q:**  Did you go after donkeys when you were fifteen to seventeen years old?   

**A:**  Yes.   

**Q:**  Tell us in detail what you did when you went after the donkeys? Did the donkeys belong to your family?   

**A:**  Yes, they belonged to my family.   

**Q:**  How many donkeys did you have?   

**A:**  I had five donkeys and a mule. I used to load the donkeys with wool and deliver the wool in Phari and get the transportation fee.   

**Q:**  Did you travel from morning until the evening?   

**A:**  I had to get up at four in the morning and depart.   

**Q:**  Was it dark?   

**A:**  Yes. We stopped for a meal at eight o'clock. Then I would unload the donkeys and feed them hay, and boil tea and drink the tea with balls of tsamba and a little bit of meat. Each person had about a quarter of a sheep carcass and we would eat one or two ribs. At that time, there was no tsamba soup. When we felt hungry in the daytime, we would eat round bread and yö. After that, we would travel until almost sunset.   

**Q:**  Did you stay overnight in an inn or in a tent?   

**A:**  No. We stayed outside. I had six meals during three days and nights like the saying, "Travelers have six meals during three days and nights [tib. 'grul pa zhag gsum lto drug yin]." We had only two meals in a day, one in the morning and one in the evening. When we went to Lhasa, it took ten days. I have been to Lhasa only once. It took about twelve days to Phari. I went to Phari from the age sixteen to twenty-one. Then the revolt took place and there were no wool or Indian imports [to transport].   

**Q:**  At night did you tie the donkeys up?   

**A:**  Yes, I would tie them facing each other and feed them with hay.   

**Q:**  Did you let the donkeys go to the mountain to graze?   

**A:**  No, we didn't. Our household was like a big empty house and our livelihood was not good. In the past, one of our family members took the post of the aide of the depön on duty [tib. bzhugs res] in the Regiment, but our economic condition was not that good. We also had to go to Lhasa to transport a meat tax to Lhasa. There were about one hundred carcasses of sheep which were used for the soup that was served to the prayer assembly of the monks [at the Mönlam Prayer festival]. One to two hundred carcasses were to be offered to H.H. the Dalai Lama. I was told to take the meat to Lhasa, but I insisted that I would not go to Lhasa. Later, [I went and] each treba household paid me four khe of barley as a wage. Each household had to give one carcass of mutton as their meat tax. The meat to be offered to the Dalai Lama was called the Shesha [tib. bzhes sha].   

**Q:**  When you were driving the donkeys, did you take a rest at midday?   

**A:**  There wasn't any rest at midday. We had to travel until seven to eight in the evening. We had to feed the donkeys at night four to five times. So we didn't get a good sleep. Back then, there were also many thieves, like the people from Amdo who were wandering around, and there were also murderers. They were fighting with people and also robbing them. After coming back from Phari, we would drink beer and tea, and make some bagthug soup for two days, though we didn't have vegetable dishes like nowadays. That was like an arrival party and it was called phebgu [tib. phebs mgu].   

**Q:**  Did you sing while you were traveling?   

**A:**  Yes. We would sing while we were going after the donkeys on the plains. When the road was not flat, we wouldn't sing songs. That was like the proverb, "When people go on the plains, they sing [the Gesar song] Alathala and when they go through the narrow gorge along the river, they [visualize] the Master Padmasambhava [tib. thang bde mo byung na glu a la tha la, lam dog mo byung na bla ma o rgyan pad ma]."   

**Q:**  When you were going after donkeys, did you have special kinds of songs to sing?   

**A:**  It was the same. We would sing the songs that we sang when drinking beer. There weren't any special songs for the donkey herders.   

**Q:**  The yak herders had special songs, right?   

**A:**  Yes. The shepherds also had their songs. The nomads had their songs, and the Khambas and the people from Kongpo also had their songs. But we sang just whatever songs would come out from our mouths.   

**Q:**  Were all the donkey herders men or were there female donkey herders?   

**A:**  We would not make the girls go after the donkeys because they couldn't walk so much and they couldn't load the donkeys. The men were also young. Otherwise, they couldn't walk so much.   

**Q:**  How many jin could a donkey carry?   

**A:**  The heaviest loads were about seventy jin and a donkey was loaded with two loads. Actually, the standard load was one mound which was equal to sixty jin. The loads like cloth and serge were heavier than that. They were about seventy jin. One donkey was loaded with one hundred and forty jin. Some of the loads had more than one hundred jin. When we loaded the hay, the load was very big and had to be lifted by four people. One such load was one hundred and sixty jin.   

**Q:**  How much transportation fee did you get for a donkey load?   

**A:**  There were many different rates. Later, I got about 105 dotse for a donkey load. Sometimes, the fee was 15-17-20-30-50 dotse.   

**Q:**  Were donkeys regarded highly?   

**A:**  Yes, they were regarded highly. We could buy tea and cloth, and all kinds of other stuff with the transportation fees we earned. Hence, donkeys were regarded highly, and the dzo were also regarded highly and their price was high because they were also used for plowing the fields. Donkeys were also expensive. There were also just a few households who were going to Phari. In this xiang, there were only about two hundred households who could go to Phari (to do this transportation work).   

**Q:**  Were your donkeys good?   

**A:**  Yes, they were quite good.   

**Q:**  Did you give names to the donkeys?   

**A:**  Yes, I gave names to my donkeys.   

**Q:**  What kind of names did you give?   

**A:**  I had a black donkey with a reddish mouth [tib. rdza dmar] for which I paid 105 dotse. I called it Dzamar. I bought a donkey from Samling Labrang [tib. bsam gling bla brang] and I called it Labrang. I had a white donkey that I called "young white [tib. kartrug (dkar phrug)]." I had a yellow donkey I called "round yellow" [tib. serii (ser ril)]. I bought a donkey from a house called Ngabö [tib. nga phod] so I called it Ngabö.   

**Q:**  Could you recognize your own donkeys from among a herd of donkeys?   

**A:**  I could definitely recognize my donkeys from amongst one to two hundred donkeys, or even from among several thousand donkeys.   

**Q:**  Did you make any kind of identification marks on their ears?   

**A:**  No. But I could recognize them from the color of their hair. They were like one's family members because I made them suffer all the time.   

**Q:**  When the donkeys were reluctant to go on the way, did you beat them?   

**A:**  Yes. I would beat them with a type of stick called togma [tib. tog ma]. When the donkey was not obedient, I would beat it with the stick side of the whip and when they were quite obedient, I would just hit them slightly with the leather strap side. The whip was imported from India and was longer than this. I beat them very much so I committed a lot of sins.   

**Q:**  If you beat them with the stick, wouldn't the donkey get injured or sick?   

**A:**  They would not get injured, but when I beat them up, they would go like this.   

**Q:**  Did you beat the donkeys quite a lot?   

**A:**  Yes. I beat them up quite a lot.   

**Q:**  Didn't you feel compassion for them?   

**A:**  I didn't feel any compassion. When a donkey was reluctant to go, I just beat it right away. From the age of about forty, I had a sense of compassion and I knew a little bit about religion and about death. Before that, I didn't have any compassion.   

**Q:**  When you went to Phari to transport wool and transport back Indian goods from there, how much net profit did you get?   

**A:**  From Phari to Shigatse, the transportation fee was twelve dotse for a donkey load. That was the highest rate. When we had five donkeys and one mule, the transportation fee we got from two donkeys had to be used for the expenses. So we could get the transportation fee for four donkeys as the net profit. We bought dzo and donkeys with that money. At that time, we had to attend meetings many times, and when we were late for the meetings, we had to pay money as a fine. If someone didn't attend the meeting at all, they had to pay a lot of money as the fine.   

**Q:**  How many times did you go to Phari in a year?   

**A:**  We didn't go to Phari in the summer. During the summer, the donkeys were grazed in the pasture areas. We had to make our own boots and go to the places where there was a good pasture. After the harvesting and the threshing were over, we would go to Phari in the ninth Tibetan month. We would go to Phari eleven to twelve times in a year during the winter.   

**Q:**  So, you had quite a good profit, right?   

**A:**  Yes, it was not bad. But the money was used for paying taxes and those things. It was like the proverb, "The insect eating the insect's tail [tib. 'bu'i gzhu gu 'bus za]." So our economic condition didn't improve. Nowadays, we can get income from sideline work and improve our livelihood. but at that time it wasn't like that. In those days, we didn't have shirts and sweaters. For the men, we would make a white woolen garment and the front part was made from black woolen materials. We were wearing it as underwear and it would become dirty. Clothing was scarce.   

**Q:**  Over that garment, did you wear the fleece-lined dress [tib. slog pa]?   

**A:**  We wore goatskin dresses, and for the best we wore a fox skin cap or some other fur cap. When we had to travel on the vast open lands in Winter, we would make the bedding like a bag with the top and bottom open with three pieces of goatskin. We would wear it and tie a belt and travel on the open areas. When we tied our bootstrap, we didn't need to make a knot. They would get frozen and stuck when we just stuck them with spit.   

**Q:**  Did you have socks to wear?   

**A:**  We were wearing woolen knitted caps [misunderstood the question], but when we travelled in those places, they could not prevent the cold. If a little part of the cap was slightly opened, the cold wind would hurt us severely.   

**Q:**  When you had to walk all the way did you wear Tibetan woolen boots [tib. zon pa]?   

**A:**  Yes, we wore woolen boots.   

**Q:**  How long would a pair of woolen boots last?   

**A:**  Usually, a pair of woolen boots would be enough for the journey because we put a leather sole on the boot. But, we also took an extra pair of boots without the leather sole to be changed when it was snowing because the snow would damage the leather sole.   

**Q:**  Did a pair of boots last for one journey to Phari?   

**A:**  It would last for a month or so.   

**Q:**  When you were on your way to Phari, were there any fixed places for stopping for meals?   

**A:**  There were fixed places to break for lunch called tshasa, and places for staying over night called shagsa [tib. zhags sa]. We always stopped and stayed overnight at the fixed places.   

**Q:**  Were there households in those fixed places?   

**A:**  In some places there were households and in some places we just stopped at some corners and sometimes on the plain.   

**Q:**  Did you take your bedding with you?   

**A:**  Yes, we had simple bedding with us.   

**Q:**  How did you manage the hay and fodder for the donkeys on the trail?   

**A:**  We had to feed the donkeys with one full wooden bowl of fodder in the morning and two bowls for the mules.   

**Q:**  Did you carry the hay with you?   

**A:**  Yes, we carried the hay with us.   

**Q:**  Could you buy the hay on the way?   

**A:**  Yes, but it was expensive. We asked the lodging inns and the places where we would break for lunch to keep the hay to be used when coming back.   

**Q:**  Did you have other donkeys for loading the hay?   

**A:**  When we went to Phari, we would load one donkey with the hay and the other four with the transport goods.   

**Q:**  Was one donkey load of hay enough?   

**A:**  Yes. And the fodder was put on some of the lighter loads as an additional load. When we had about eight donkeys, six donkeys were loaded with the transport goods and two donkeys were loaded with hay, fodder and food.   

**Q:**  Did you have a donkey to ride?   

**A:**  That was out of question. Let alone riding the donkeys, we also had to carry some loads when the weak donkeys got exhausted. Only the muleteers had mules to ride. And there were also bandits on the way.   

**Q:**  Your mule was also going with the donkeys, right?   

**A:**  Yes. The muleteers of the aristocrats and traders would depart after sunrise and the muleteer had a mule to ride. They were more powerful on the trail and they also beat the donkey herders up on the way.   

**Q:**  Did they look down on the donkey herders?   

**A:**  Yes. The donkey herders were regarded as the most weak people.   

**Q:**  When some donkey herders were tough, they wouldn't yield to the muleteers, right?   

**A:**  Yes. There was an old donkey herder. He was really brave and he fought with the muleteers once. Some of the donkey herders also had beaten up the muleteers. But most of the donkey herders were beaten by the muleteers. When we had to work for the corvée taxes, it was hard. Sometimes, we were quite happy when we stole some sugar and brown sugar from the loads. It was also risking our lives. We were afraid of being killed somewhere. We couldn't sleep soundly putting up a high pillow.   

**Q:**  At that time, how did you find the loads to be transported?   

**A:**  The big traders bought the wholesale loads of merchandise and we had to go to ask them for loads to be transported.   

**Q:**  Did you have certain people to get in touch with to find the transportation work in Shigatse? Or did you have to go find the work?   

**A:**  We went to Shigatse with the donkeys and went to find the transportation work there. If the wool hadn't arrived yet from the north, we had to wait a couple of days. After a few years, we knew the traders and we went to ask them whether wool had come or not.   

**Q:**  In those days, did people think of donkey herding work as good work?   

**A:**  It was regarded as good work because we could go to Phari and earn an income. In families, after the household head who was in charge, the donkey herder was the next most highly regarded person.   

**Q:**  When you went to Lhasa, Shigatse, Gyantse and Yadong, did you feel kind of proud?   

**A:**  I didn't feel kind of proud, but I thought that it was good for me to have seen many different places and many good and bad people.   

**Q:**  How did you find Lhasa when you first got there?   

**A:**  I thought that Lhasa was great, although at that time, I only went to visit the Jokhang. I saw Lhasa as a big plain with a mountain and the Potala Palace in the middle. I thought this place was a great sanctuary of the Buddha and I had seen the statue of Buddha in the Jokhang. So, I felt very glad.   

**Q:**  When you were about to see the Potala Palace from the distance, did people take off their hats or untie their braids from their heads?   

**A:**  Yes, we could see the Potala Palace when we got to Jangtö [tib. 'jang stod] and Jangme [tib. 'jang smad], and when we got to the Yuthok Bridge, people took off their hats and did their prayers. I felt I was taking refuge in the Potala [tib. skyabs su mchi]. After that, when I went to Phari and Shigatse, I thought it was really okay for me to be able to go on the small alleys by myself.   

**Q:**  How did you go to Lhasa for the first time? Were you alone or did you have some companions?   

**A:**  There were seven of us including a muleteer from Sogang village [in Panam Dzong]. We delivered the loads and went for a pilgrimage to the Jokhang. The water was good, so I could eat three bowls of bag [tsamba balls]. I was also one of the strongest among the donkey herders. I had a small dagger with me, so I thought I would be able to defeat those people from Amdo and whoever else would attack me. The people in our generation were brave and lived long lives. We were regarded as a high birth.  When I went to remote places and when I got into fights with other people, I used to feel glad and I thought of attacking them and I didn't care even if I died. The worst was when we got into fights in our own place because people would talk a lot saying that he was good or bad and he was fighting. I was so strong that only two weak people could cope with me. If we fought in a remote place, even if we killed people, nobody would say anything.   

**Q:**  Just before the revolt, when you were around Lhasa and those places, the People's Liberation Army and the Chinese had already arrived. Did you meet them on the way?   

**A:**  Yes, I met them.   

**Q:**  What did you think when you met them?   

**A:**  I just had kind of uncertain [tib. te chal go chal] thoughts wondering what would happen in the future. They [People's Liberation Army] might not be bossy and they might be tolerant [tib. sbo chen po]. I cut down electric poles and stole the wires to be used for something else. While I was doing that, a military motorcade of about thirty to forty trucks came. When they saw us stealing the wires, they called us to come over. We told them through their interpreter, "We are sorry! We cut down the pole and stole the wires." They just told us not to do that again and they left. I thought they were very tolerant. If it was in the old society, they would have beaten us up and punished us.   

**Q:**  When did you see the Chinese the first time?   

**A:**  I saw a Chinese military motorcade when I went to Phari.   

**Q:**  What did you think at that time?   

**A:**  When I saw the motorcade, I thought it would be great to climb up the mountain pass making that kind of sound. After that, when we went to sell firewood to the People's Liberation Army Regiment, they were paying with dayan silver coins. I thought that they were very rich and great. After some time passed, we couldn't go to Phari to do the transportation work.   

**Q:**  Did you think that you were the subjects [miser] of the Tibetan government or did you think that you were the subjects of the PRC?   

**A:**  I didn't think that I was a subject of the PRC. I thought that I was a subject of the Tibetan government. After the [democratic] reforms and the "oppose the three and exempt the two" campaign, I knew that they [Chinese] were the leaders. After the ngadag and the ngatsab were opposed, punished and imprisoned, and it was said that the leader was the Chairman Mao, I thought he [Mao] became the leader. When I saw many soldiers and the motorcades with so many trucks in Phari, I never thought that we would belong to them and they would be our leaders. At that time, I was afraid of them. When I saw the motorcades I thought they might seize us and imprison us because we had stolen the wires, but they didn't do that. So I thought they were tolerant. The wires were there from the old society.  I was just watching the trucks and running after them, and holding the back side of the trucks and I fell down.   

**Q:**  Did you think that the old society would come to an end soon?   

**A:**  I just thought that the land belonged to the old society...   

**Q:**  I mean did you think that the old society would be finished soon and a new society would come?   

**A:**  When I was selling firewood to them [the People's Liberation Army], I thought I belonged to the Tibetan government...
  

**Q:**  Did you think that the society would change?   

**A:**  No. I never thought that there would be any earthshaking changes.   

**Q:**  The Tibetan soldiers had a different kind of uniform. When you saw the People's Liberation Army wearing their own uniforms, what did you think they were?   

**A:**  I just thought that they came out from that place [China]. I never thought that they would make such an earthshaking change. I thought the Tibetan government of the old society would remain as before. After the revolt was put down, I thought that now the political power had changed and I should regard the Chinese and Chairman Mao as the leader. Before that, the aristocrat in this place was a progressive one [tib. yar thon]. He gave the land to the miser, but we didn't accept that saying that we would not take the land of the lord. I thought what kind of aristocrat was this? It was said that the lands of the aristocrats would be equalized and that the rich and the poor would be equalized. After that, we studied about the "three oppositions and two concessions."   

**Q:**  Before the revolt, when you were going to Phari, did you meet any Communist Party cadres and Work Team cadres? Did they do publicity regarding the revolution?   

**A:**  We were just called to the meetings, but we were just thinking that we belonged to the Tibetan government. They called the headmen to attend the study sessions. I never thought that they would change the political power.   

**Q:**  When you met the cadres, what did they say?   

**A:**  They were making publicity through their interpreters. But I was wondering what they were going to do. When it was said that Tibet would be peacefully liberated, the small householders who didn't have land might have been attentive [tib. ha nyid go] and joined the activists and the cadres before that. But the better households who had land were not very attentive.   

**Q:**  When the revolt took place in Lhasa, were you surprised or did you expect that the revolt would take place?   

**A:**  I never thought it would happen like that.   

**Q:**  What did you think when you heard that the revolt occurred in Lhasa?   

**A:**  When I heard that, I thought that Tibet would be liberated peacefully.   

**Q:**  Were you scared or were you happy when you heard that?   

**A:**  I was neither scared nor happy. People were dancing and beating drums. Even people in their sixties and seventies had to dance. They felt happy and all the people's thoughts were kind of uncertain. People were not very attentive no matter how good the economic conditions were. When people were marching in a line, and beating drums and playing cymbals, I thought that was strange because even old people had to dance.   

**Q:**  Before that, you were thinking that you were the subject of the Tibetan government. Did you feel kind of sad because the Tibetan government had lost and the Chinese had seized power?   

**A:**  I didn't have that kind of feeling. I was just a treba household and I was not categorized as a ngadag or as a ngatsab. Hence, I didn't have that kind of feeling. I thought that I would be happy and I never thought it would be bad for me.   

**Q:**  At that time, the revolt took place in Lhasa and the political power of the Tibetan government was lost, so did you feel kind of sad?   

**A:**  I didn't feel sad about that. I felt glad because I didn't need to repay the loans we had that were supposed to be paid back in four years, and I got land for myself in the new democratic Mutual Aid Team, and I didn't need to work at corvée ula taxes any more.   

**Q:**  Later, when the monasteries were closed and destroyed, what did you think?   

**A:**  Concerning that, I thought it was a real pity when the ngadag, the ngatsab and us, the middle peasants, were sent to destroy the monastery called Riser. At that time, I thought that if they destroy the Tibetan religion, it might not have a good result.   

**Q:**  The Tibetan people have faith towards religion. So when you were told that you were not allowed to practice religion and they destroyed the monastery, what did you think?   

**A:**  In this place when they destroyed the monastery and they forced the monks and the nuns to lose their celibacy, I thought that was bad. Actually, H.H. the Dalai Lama had to leave, so I should have felt miserable, but I didn't feel miserable [at that]. But, when they destroyed the religion, I had some thoughts that this might not be a good thing. When they were carrying the flags and holding the struggle sessions, I felt happy. I also held struggle sessions against some of the ngadag and ngatsab. In the past, when I was going to graze donkeys in the summer, the person called the Gyangong Dupu was kind of the leader of Gyangong. When my donkeys grazed a little bit on the pasture that belonged to him, he locked up my donkeys in his house and I had to give him a ceremonial scarf, meat, butter and eggs when I requested that he release my donkeys. Later, he became a reactionary and he was brought to this place. So I held a struggle session against him and I told him that he did like that to me in the past. I told him, "You had been a person that only the rain in the summer and the wind in the winter could cope with [tib. dbyar charpas ma gtogs glags me 'khel dgun rlung bus ma gtogs glags ma 'khel] [i.e., no one could cope with him]." I told him, "When I grazed my donkeys, you ate meat, butter and eggs from me." And I grabbed the hair on top of his head. I was young and I didn't think much about the new society and the old society. I was just acting recklessly [tib. ya 'o 'tshong].   

**Q:**  Did you beat him up?   

**A:**  I didn't really beat him up. I just seized the hair on top of his head and pressed him down and told him to confess.   

**Q:**  What year was that?   

**A:**  That was during the reforms. He was the first person that they brought for the struggle session. In the past, he took many cases to the Kashag in Lhasa and he took the case against the ngadag in this place. His name was Gyamtso.   

**Q:**  Did you hold the struggle session voluntarily or did they tell you to do that?   

**A:**  We were told that if anybody had hatred toward this household, you should come to hold the struggle session against him. There were three households including me who had hatred towards him, so we held the struggle session against him.   

**Q:**  Did you hold the struggle session only because of hatred regarding grazing donkeys or did you have any other reasons?   

**A:**  That was the only reason. I didn't have any other reason. Otherwise, we didn't have any relations in the past. We just knew each other. Actually, he didn't tell us to bring meat, butter and eggs, but we took those things as a gift to request the release of our donkeys.
