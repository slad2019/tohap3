### Tape 4  
**A:**  I really don't know how much they sold. The Kashag helped them, but not energetically. It was not okay not to sell it. How much I can't say.   

**Q:**  In 1951 were there about 10,000 People's Liberation Army [soldiers]?   

**A:**  I don't know clearly. It was top secret.   

**Q:**  Tashi Tsering: If we guess, there were probably not many, right? We could see that the soldiers who are now at the border hadn't come at that time.   

**A:**  Yes, but I think it was approximately between 10,000 and 20,000, because at this time it was very difficult to feed the soldiers. If they brought too many troops, there was no grain.   

**Q:**  They couldn't transport the [grain] from down there, right?   

**A:**  Yes. The reason why we didn't put much effort into selling grain was because Lukhangwa told them, "We don't have much grain for ourselves. So we can't help a lot." And he put forward those bad proverbs. So we didn't support them energetically, but we did a little.   

**Q:**  Thank you very much.
