### Tape 1  
**A:**  Yes, I was a trenyog. I had served for the Yuthor [Tib. g.yu thor?] Household. Since I was about 14 years old, our lord [Tib. dpon po] ordered me worked for him. Herding cattle was my job.   

**Q:**  What was your household? Was it a treba or düjung?   

**A:**  My household in that time was a düjung and my parents served for others. We had a very small house. Since I was 14 years old, I herded cows for the family. At morning, I collected dungs of cows, feed them and afternoon I feed them again. In the summer, I herded those animals.   

**Q:**  Who was your lord?   

**A:**  Yuthog.   

**Q:**  This village is Shöl [Tib. zhol] village of Chushü [Tib. chu shur] County. Where is the Yuthor?   

**A:**  This household was a shungyupa. There were five households who would obey the order of the dzong. The Yuthor household leased one shiga. This household paid leases but they also had servants. This shiga was belonged to Muru Lamoshar, [Tib. rme ru la mo shar]. This household had to pay lease. After I grew up, they told me to do such as a stable boy, cooking helper, or sending messages and working on the dzong's field called [Tib. phyag 'debs] There were lots of works needed to do. If there was a traveler, I went to send messages for arranging animals to move his belongs. Sometimes, our lord went to Tshapanang, [Tib. tshal pa nang] or Tashitse, [Tib. bkra shis rtse]. I went to get back the horse corvee. Sometimes government messengers [Tib. a drun) or soldiers needed animals and I also went to get back their horses. I walked to there and got back horses the place where they went. If I went to send messages. I did this work many times. All of those jobs had to be done by those five households in this area.  Since I grew up as an adult man, I was told to farm for the household. I had plow their lands, watered their lands, and harvested for them. Sometimes if they did not have enough people, I would be told to send messages or something else.   

**Q:**  Did your household have lands at that point?   

**A:**  We had a field for working for them called Leshing, [Tib. las zhing] that had been leased in return for a fifty days' work. But I worked for the household whole years. I plowed in the spring and so on. I think I do not have to say specifically what I had done in there for the household.  When I was 21 years old, I heard that the Communist was going to arrive at Tibet. In the tax document, [Tib. khral gzhung] of Tibetan Government, probably had that item in which they could collect soldiers in some cases. So they collected new soldiers and established new army troops such as Drongdrag, [Tib. grong drag] Regiment where they collected soldiers from better condition households. They also collected conscripting soldiers as corvee tax from other treba households. That was conscripting one soldier from 12 gang of shungyupa and one soldier from 6 don of gerpa which was called Jugnyi Drugna,[Tib. bcu gnyis drug sna]. My master [Tib. sbyin bdag] was a sibling of the Chushü Samkhar [Tib. chu shur bsam mkhar] household. But they only had 1 gang and 3 phü [Tib. 'phul]   

**Q:**  How many kal of lands for one tax unit?   

**A:**  I guess one gang had about 70 or 80 khe of lands. My lord got his share from Samkhar household and my master had a small shiga in upper area in Samkhar's land. His original household had five gang and another household called Samdong shar [Tib. zam gdong shar] had four and half gang. My master with these two households together had about 12 gang and these three households were required to send one soldier. So I was sent to be a soldier. It was a way to collect soldiers in order to protect from Communists.   

**Q:**  What was Jugnyi Drugna?   

**A:**  It is the name of the tax for conscripting soldiers where 1 soldier was conscripted from 12 gang of treba and 1 soldiers from 6 gang of gerpa. The tax was based on the land and the land was divided into gang. The bigger gang had more lands and the smaller had less land. My master only had one and half gang, but his original household had many gang, so I was sent to be a soldier.  After I became a soldier, I was sent in Tsethang, [Tib. rtsed thang] and I was trained with others in there. They said there were over one thousand. Probably the number was close to two thousands. Our training teachers were soldiers of the Gusung Regiment from Lhasa and our depön was Gabde [Tib. dga' bde].   

**Q:**  How did you feel when you were collected as a soldier?   

**A:**  I was little afraid to be killed in wars because at that time I had my parents. In addition, I had a wife. We just got married. So I was worrying about my safety. But my lord ordered me to go, so I could not say I did not want to go.   

**Q:**  What did your family say for about it?   

**A:**  We did not have choices to say something because my lord ordered me to do it. I was sent in a coracle from here to Tsetang. We stayed one night in Lumba [Tib. lum pa], and another night in behind of the Tranang [Tib. gra nang]. We stayed two days on the road and we arrived in Tsethang in the third day.   

**Q:**  Who paid for the coracle?   

**A:**  It was paid by the association of the representatives of treba under the dzong, Duji, [Tib. 'du spyi] in Chushü. I did not know the reason, but Kabshö Chögyel Nyima, [Tib. ka shod chos rgyal nyi ma was banished to Lhokha Nedong, [Tib. sne gdong]. People were saying that his banishing was caused by the war of Sera. There were some soldiers came from Nyan, [Tib. gnyan] and Dzayü, [Tib. rdza yul] areas. One hundred soldiers were chosen from our troop and sent to Nedong. I was one of them. We were not asked to build it, but there was a house. I heard that this house was a square prison room in which it only had one span of a person's outstretched hands from right hand's fingertip to left hand's fingertip, [Tib. 'dom gang gru bzhi]. We were sent to Nedong of Lhokha to look Kabshöpa. It was close to the Tsethang. We went there but we did not have to look at him. We lived in an old house. This house was belonged to a big household before. We opened some new doors and one squad of ten soldiers [Tib. bcu shog] lived in one room. We stayed in there.   

**Q:**  How did they give you the military training?   

**A:**  At that time, Tibetan military used English. Then in a summer, Gyelkhar Nangpa, [Tib. rgyal mkhar nang pa], an lay official who used to be the dzongpön Gongkar, [Tib. gong dkar] Dzong, came to our troop and took half soldiers from our troop to Horbachen [Tib. hor sbra chen] in order to do against with Communists if they came. In the same year autumn, we got our salary and told us that we would be sent to Lhasa in the day after tomorrow.   

**Q:**  What did you get for the salary?   

**A:**  We got grain as our salary. I could get two khe of grain per month.   

**Q:**  Was it usual salary?   

**A:**  Yes. One soldier had two khe of grain and one ball of tea. At that time the shape of tea leaves was ball, not brick like today we have. And we had 25 ngüsang per month. At that time, we could impose pack animals from local people in order to move our things. The depön had horses to ride but we came by walks. We were told to cross the river at the a ferry site, Gepadru [Tib. gad pa gru] and arrive Samye before the sunshine, but when we crossed the ferry side it was sunset and because we all had our food and bedding with us and we put those things on animals. There was a house in the bottom of the mountain where usually lived the people who sailed coracles. We cooked tea and ate a simple food in this house. Most people had already gone. Our group had about 5 or 6 people with some animals. After we had food, we continued our trip at the whole night. No one of us had gone on the road, so we did not know where we were. We heard there were nine sand mountain passes and nine valleys in which means that there are many mountains and valleys. Sometimes we needed to climb hills and sometime we had to go in valleys. Sometimes there was good road but sometimes the road was not so good. Then we arrived in Samye, [Tib. bsam yas] in the next morning and then we went for the pilgrimage in Samye. Then we sent messages for the horse coevee and pack animals. Some soldiers got horses or donkeys, but our group got yak. The next day, at dawn, we crossed the Gökhar la, [Tib. rgod 'khar la] mountain pass. Before crossing the pass, we had a lunch in the upper area of Samye where had a family. We just ate some food quickly without loading our belongs from yak. In the old society, it was called Tsal Dechen [Tib. tshal sde chen] but today it is Tagtse [Tib. stag rtse] County located in there. When the sun went down behind of the mountain, we arrived in that village. At that time most soldiers already arrived in there but a few did not.   

**Q:**  You did not have to make line while you took the trip, did you?   

**A:**  No, we did not have to. The depön and mounted troop were riding horses and went before us, but we came later alone. There were no leaders with us. We stayed in Dechen about 15 days. Then they chose some soldiers from us in order to train how to use machine guns. It had one hundred soldiers. These soldiers were sent to Lhasa. I went to the Nyamön Regiment that located where there were two stone lions [Tib. rdo seng ge]. However, there was no one care for us about 8 or 10 days. We swept some rooms by ourselves and lived in there. Then one day a tsidrung who was said to be living in the house called Sharjikhyab [Tib. shar spyi khyab] and a young lay official called Sechung [Tib. gsar byung] came to our regiment and began to train about machine guns, [Ch. ji qiang].   

**Q:**  Was it the first time you got guns?   

**A:**  Not really. We had guns when we were in the Tsethang. However, those guns were almost useless guns. At that time, the guns could shoot but bad quality. In addition, soldiers got different guns. Some soldiers got the Chinese gun called Gyashang, [Tib. rgya shang] and the other got the gun which goes nine bullets [Ch. jiu zi pao]. After we arrived in Lhasa, we got the English 303 carbines. Everyone in our troop got such guns, but even though there were one hundred soldiers, we only had four machine guns. In the day the young tsidrung and lay official taught us how to use machine guns. We trained about it about two or three guns.   

**Q:**  At that time you had very serious discipline, did not you?   

**A:**  Yes, at that time while we were training, they used English. If the depön ordered us made a line, we made a line and if he ordered us lied down on the ground, we lied down and if he ordered us to shoot the guns, we shot it without bullets. If you did not know what they were saying, then you would confuse what you should to do. They used English, so if you know its meaning, you would understand what you should do.   

**Q:**  Were your teachers Tibetan?   

**A:**  Yes. One was a young tsidrung and the other one was a young lay official. I heard they went to Britain to get trained. We know where their houses were in Lhasa. Before the soldiers of Gusung Regiment had taught us some, but it was only the language training that we would probably use.  A group of soldiers left in Nedong to look after Kabshöpa. After we stayed in Lhasa a time, they came to Lhasa. They said the Chinese had already arrived at Lhokha. They said, "The Chinese officer and his wife arrived at Lhoka and the Chinese told us to return to Lhasa, so we came back to here."   

**Q:**  Did they fight with?   

**A:**  No, they did not mention at all. I heard that probably because Tibet did not have relationship with England, Liushar Thubten Tharpa, [Tib. sneu shar thub bstan thar pa] and Surkhang Wangchen Geleg, [Tib. zur khang dbang chen dge legs] and their partners invented the Tibetan military language. They translated the English into Tibetan. We heard that they translated it into Tibetan in order to indicate Tibet did not relate with England. They translated some of them but we did not know why did they do it. We only had the right to listen what the lord [Tib. dpon po] said. But they were not able to translate completely into Tibetan.   

**Q:**  Did you know why they try to show Tibet did not relate with England?   

**A:**  I did not know, but people were saying that they wanted to show Tibet did not relate with England.  Later this troop was divided into Police Stations in Lhasa. At that time, the main Police Regiment was in the [Tib. khrom gzigs khang and its stations was located in the house called [Tib. kong po dro khang] in Thephungang, [Tib. thal spungs sgang, and Shöl. All of our hundred soldiers' troop was divided into those police stations and I was sent to Shöl Police Station.   

**Q:**  Was your troop divided into each police station?   

**A:**  Yes. It was like as you see some policemen stay in Barkor street today. It was not exactly same but was pretty similar. There were small wooden huts on the streets and the policemen stayed in it. After one's duty was over, one another policeman would change him, but they had to stay on duty in the hut day and night. Most of them came from Tsang, [Tib. gtsang] areas, especially the Tö [Tib. stod] area. We were in Shöl. That station was located in the corner of the hill of right side of Potala Palace. Did you notice a small shop was opened in there today?   

**Q:**  Yes, I have seen it.   

**A:**  The station was in there. At that time, there was one room in the first floor and one room in the second floor. One another room was built closed with it. Our duty was stay in there. At that time, the lay official Shöl Chabdrel Tshang, [Tib. chab drel tshang] and Tsidrung Garjang, [Tib. mgar byang] and Jangma Khangsar, [Tib. lcang ma khang gsar] were our leaders. They were the in charge and they would hold meetings for us and order us what we needed to do. On the other hand, this police station was an office under main Police Regiment. There was also a shengo of the Police Regiment called, Nyima, [Tib. nyi ma], who came from Tö.  After we worked as policemen a time, the Chamdo [Tib. chab mdo] War was engaged and lots of Tibetan soldiers fled into Lhasa. When they fled back to Lhasa, four or five soldiers held as a group and plundered from others. So some soldiers had lots of wealth that carried by animals. On the other hand, some soldiers did not have anything. They even did not have a bowl to drink. About that time, each of us got a Tibetan chupa, a pair of boots, a mammot skin cap.   

**Q:**  Was it a set of military uniform?   

**A:**  Yes. The chupa was kaki color. The boot had white woolen legs with lather bottoms. Later they collected those clothes from us and let us returned to our homes. We were told that we did not have to fight. You know, Gabde collected those things from us and we handed in our weapons to them. I stayed in Lhasa a short time. It was a summer. It was probably April of that summer.   

**Q:**  What did you do?   

**A:**  I did nothing. In the last winter, the Dalai Lama went to India. He left from Lhasa at night. We were on the road of outside of Shöl.   

**Q:**  Did you know about it at that night?   

**A:**  No, we did not. We knew about it later. However, we heard the bells' sounds that made from inside of bags. But we did not know who was taking trip. We knew Dalai Lama went to India later and some Lhasa people were crying. Then in the April of the summer, Lhasa people were saying that Dalai Lama and PRC officials would arrive in Kyangthang Naga [Tib. kyang thang na kha). In that case, those kudrak wives dressed nice clothes, hung expensive jewelry, took tsampa mixed with butter and chang offering [Tib. phye ma chang phud] and went to Kyangthang Naga to show welcome. We saw after the celebration in the place, the Dalai Lama went to his Summer Palace [Tib. nor bu gling kha] and Zhang Jingwu went to Lhasa by riding horses. They received khata and flower wreathes. Zhang Jingwu was taken to the house of Yütog [Tib. g.yu thog] House.   

**Q:**  Was there a hotel?   

**A:**  No, he was taken to the house of Yütog Household. While he and his partners were entering the city, they were taking lots of pictures included the Potala Palace. After that time, I returned to my home in rural area because I was already told to go home.  After I returned to my home, the life returned normal again. I plowed lands and paid corvess taxes.   

**Q:**  How long have you been a soldier?   

**A:**  I had been a soldier for about two years.   

**Q:**  Did you return to your home during the two years?   

**A:**  Yes, I returned one time.   

**Q:**  When was it? Was it in the time when you were in Lhokha?   

**A:**  Yes, it was.   

**Q:**  Did you have to ask for leaving to your depön?   

**A:**  Yes, I had to. It was the rule that I offered one khata to the depön and asked for leaving. He would give you a time limit and you had to return on time.   

**Q:**  Could you tell me how did they train you (in the regiment)? For example, what were you doing from the morning to evening?   

**A:**  In the morning when they whistled, we get up and do the exercises for hands and feet and practiced (the English) numbers.   

**Q:**  What kinds of food did you have?   

**A:**  No one gave us food. We cooked by ourselves, but the squad had a cook. He boiled tea and we cooked food for ourselves. Every soldier handed in the share of tea and the cook boiled black tea. If a squad had good relationships, they could cook together, but every body in the squad had to offer their share of food. The military training was included the way of "stand at attention", "stand at ease", "left face", "right face", and so on. Sometimes we were told to lie down on the ground and practice the shooting gun. At that time all of those were trained by English.   

**Q:**  How about the discipline? Was it strict?   

**A:**  Yes, it had a very tired discipline. Each squad had a jugpön. And 50 soldiers had a shengo. One hundred soldiers had a gyagpön. But the basic unit in the military was squad.   

**Q:**  Was it okay to you to go to the market to buy your needs?   

**A:**  Yes, it was okay.   

**Q:**  Did you go to the market with your military uniform?   

**A:**  Yes, we only had that set of clothes. So we had to.   

**Q:**  Did the local people know you were soldiers when you went on the market?   

**A:**  Yes, they knew.   

**Q:**  How?   

**A:**  It was the clothes that the soldiers were wearing.   

**Q:**  Were they afraid to you?   

**A:**  Yes, they did. You know some soldiers were not so good and looks like almost going to do something bad to the people.   

**Q:**  Did you have bad person in your squad?   

**A:**  Not really. The jugpön could handle all of his soldiers in our squad. He used to be a monk. He could manage us. But local people were afraid to us. As if someone wears blue dressing today, the local people will call the person "teacher" [Tib. rgan lags], at that time even though one was a common soldier, the local people would call him "military officer" [Tib. dmag dpn lags].   

**Q:**  Did you get your salary on time?   

**A:**  Yes, we did, but we heard that some troops did not give the salary on time to their soldiers. When we were in Lhasa, I knew two soldiers in the Drongdrag Regiment. One was in the new camp [Tib. dmag sgar gsar pa] in Lhasa and one was sent to Lhalu, [Tib. lha klu]. They had to come to Lhasa for getting their salaries. Sometimes they did not get their salaries on time from the government. We did not meet such situation. Usually military regiment were located far from Lhasa, their salary was more likely to be delayed.   

**Q:**  You got grain and cash as your salary from the military troop. Did you get some supports from your home?   

**A:**  No, I did not.   

**Q:**  You had some cash salary. How did you use it for?   

**A:**  I bought my clothes. The military uniform was not enough for me to wear. Actually, there were two kinds of soldiers. The condition for soldiers was depended on who sent you to be a soldier. If I was a member of a household and I was sent by this household, I might get some extra food from this household, but usually this household did not have to do anything for the soldier. If I was not member of this household but they hired me to be a soldier for them because they did not have person to be soldier, they would pay me a salary. Usually people used to pay 40 or 50 dotse per year. So the second kind of soldier had two salaries: one got from military regiment and the other got from his lord who hired him.   

**Q:**  If you entered into the military, your family could get extra lands, right?   

**A:**  No, we did not.   

**Q:**  How about the magang of land for providing a corvee soldier to the army?   

**A:**  We did not have such lands. It was for the soldiers that serviced before us. There were lands for the military services. In the old society, the lands were divided into the government, the gerpa and the monasteries, [Tib. gzhung sger chos gsum]. And there were separated lands for magang. It was the gang for corvee soldiers. For example, if a household had two magang for corvee soldiers, this household had to send two soldiers. One was required to Gusung Regiment and other to the Trapchi Regiment. They had specific lands to plant but they were required to send specific number of soldiers. However, the soldiers send from 12 gang was an extra corvee tax. They said that Tibet was supposed to have 30 military regiments from "k" to "a" characters of Tibetan and this requirement was indicated in the original tax documents.   

**Q:**  Was the ula related to the lands?   

**A:**  Not.   

**Q:**  Was the ula depended on the lands?   

**A:**  We were not such treba households. It was an another category. Usually if is one ula, one had lands for it. This household usually may send one person to pay the corvee labor, but if it was busy, this household might have to send two ula. But we were not such category.   

**Q:**  When you returned to your home, the revolt was not risen yet in Lhasa, right?   

**A:**  Yes, it was not going to rise the revolt in Lhasa. At that time Zhang Guoha (should be Zhang Jinghu) just arrived in Lhasa from that place (India).   

**Q:**  How old were you at that point?   

**A:**  About 25 or 26 years old.   

**Q:**  How about your feeling? Did you feel sad or happy?   

**A:**  At that time, the Chinese men were very strange for me. Before that time, we heard many bad stories about them, so we did not know what they were going to do. I was illiterate. If I could read, I would learn about them from newspapers before they arrived.   

**Q:**  Did the military regiment hand over you to your home when you returned?   

**A:**  No, they did not. They told us that we could return home. That's all. It was just like a dog was undone from the tying. Some people found something jobs in Lhasa. A few entered into other military regiments. For example, one soldier I knew entered into Trapchi Regiment and one another entered into Gusung Regiment. But I returned to my home.   

**Q:**  How did your family say to you when you arrived in your home?   

**A:**  They had nothing to say. They said it was okay to be home because they did not have to worry about my safety.   

**Q:**  Did you continue to be a farmer?   

**A:**  Yes, I did.   

**Q:**  Did your family have lands that same as before you had entered into that military regiment?   

**A:**  Yes.   

**Q:**  What did you do?   

**A:**  I plowed or watered for our lands. I farmed on the land.   

**Q:**  Did the way to do farming have changes since you entered into the regiment?   

**A:**  Not, it was same as before. But at that time people were saying that the Chinese and Tibetan (governments) were working together. After I returned to my home, the two governments had worked together for a long time. After three or four years later, I went to build motorable road from Lhasa to Gyama, [Tib. rgya ma] area.   

**Q:**  Was it a duty?   

**A:**  The upper organizations asked to our master to send labor workers and he told me to go.   

**Q:**  Was it the road between Lhasa to Kongpo?   

**A:**  Yes, it was part of it. We built the road. At that time, they collected many labors. The labors came from Chushü county, Gongkar county, Nyemo county, and many other counties. It was the first time to build motorable road in that area.   

**Q:**  Did you get the salary?   

**A:**  I heard that we had high salary, but we lost some in the middle. There were soldiers of PLA with us. The head of this project from Chushü to Lhasa was the Dzasa Labrang Nyingpa [Thönpa] [Tib. bla brang rnying pa]. A tsidrung called Lodrö Namgyal, [Tib. blo gros rnam rgyal, was the head of the road project from Chushü to Lhasa and his assistants were two clerks of Shöl Lekhung. Each shiga and county sent their labors. They picked a few people as leaders of small group of people form the common labor workers. I worked four months. One box had one thousand dayang. Boxes of dayang were sent to there, but we got a few. People were saying that most of those dayang lost in the middle.   

**Q:**  How many dayang for a day?   

**A:**  If you worked very hard, you could receive 18 or 19 dayang a month. It was the biggest number. Sometimes we only got 16 dayang per month. I worked in that project about four months. Because it was a project that worked the two governments together, Chinese gave money and grain, but Tibetan life styles were not same with them, so we took food from our homes for the first month.   

**Q:**  Then did they give you rice?   

**A:**  No, they only gave tsampa. Sometimes they were not able to deliver enough tsampa for workers. Künphel la [Tib. kun 'phel lags], the Dalai Lama' personal favorite attendant , [Tib. spyan bsal] got some bean's tsampa from Phenpo, [Tib. 'phan po] area. It helped us pass 20 or 30 days. At that time the food was very shortage. I (we?) had eaten leaves of potato and radishes.   

**Q:**  When was it?   

**A:**  I do not remember when was it. But it was during the Tibetan and Chinese governments worked together.   

**Q:**  Do you know what kinds of things the two governments worked together?   

**A:**  Mainly they built roads. The Chinese gave money to Tibetan Government and the Tibetan Government offered grain from their stores. At that time, some grain was given to the poor without money. Later the government of TAR was established and those tsodrag in the county were given positions in the new government. Then some of them involved into the revolt. For example, there was a groom of Chushü Phangdong household. He was given a position of uyön. Later this household was involved into the revolt and lost this position. At that time, many Khambas of the Chushigandru men arrived in this area and they said they were protecting the Buddhism, but they made lots of troubles to the local people.   

**Q:**  Where were you when the revolt was risen?   

**A:**  I was working as a trenyog. Khamba's main camp was established in Gongkar, [Tib. gong dkar] county and one regiment was arranged in Jagsam, [Tib. lcag zam] (in Chushü). And one magji lived in the county and stationed guards [Tib. sa srung]. Once at a night, about 30 Khamba men arrived in our village with their horses. We were ordered to offer food for them and grasses and fodder for their horses. They were shooting guns. But at the next morning, they disappeared from our village. At that night, they also collected some needs from our village. When the revolt was risen, the main regiment [stopped recording for a while]   

**Q:**  Did they go to Lhasa?   

**A:**  Yes, many Khamba took their flags and went to Lhasa.   

**Q:**  Were they Khamba men?   

**A:**  Yes, they were part of the Chushigandru. They hired local people's animals when they needed, but all of them had their own horses. However, a person with me was plowing on the field at the morning. We saw that five or six people as a group were taking trip on the road near our village from Lhasa. The cook of our lord came to send food for us and he/she said that a war was engaged in Lhasa yesterday and the war was lost. I said, "Oh my!" He/she said, "It is true." About later morning, lots of people were riding their horses and coming from Lhasa. In that case, the flags were pulling on the ground. No one raised it on the air. Everybody was talking about the lost war. There were two masters in the household. One was man and the other was woman. The man's home was in the upper area of this village. In the afternoon, we left tsampa for our dzo and gave some potato and radishes to people. Then we fled to upper area where one of our masters was. Some of us stayed in there, but the other fled into upper area. There was a shiga in upper area. It was called, Karyü [Tib. dkar yul]. (We went to this shiga.) We saw from that shiga that the bridge on the river behind us was broken in order to block the Chinese regiments. At that time, there was a motorable road even though it was not so good. (At the night,) the flashes of trucks were lighting (in the bridge area). Sometimes we could see strong lights but sometimes we could not. The trucks of PLA was blocked in there and they were repairing the road. We again fled to the mountain valley of this area and stayed in there. Our animals were put on the mountain. There was a monastery in the side of that mountain. We climbed near the mountain and we saw a war was fighting. The sounds of guns, artilleries and bombs were very loud from the bridge area. We stayed in there two days.   

**Q:**  Who were fighting in the Iron Bridge area?   

**A:**  The PLA were shooting from this side and the Khamba men were shooting from the other side. Our mistress [Tib. sbyin bdag] asked a person to go to look what was going on. He did. Did you see those threshing grounds near this village? At that time, there were fields there. He came back and he said lots of artilleries were set up on that field by PLA. He also said that the PLA told him that those people who fled on the mountain should return to their homes because it was safest. PLA send that message. There were lots of people hid in the mountain areas. So we returned to our village. After we arrived in there, it was true that there were lots of artilleries were set up on fields. It was amazing.   

**Q:**  Did they take note for your returning?   

**A:**  No, they did not.   

**Q:**  How did you feel? Did you feel that everything was finished?   

**A:**  Yes, I thought the Chinese were going spread all over there. At that time, we did not know Chinese and we were afraid of them. We totally did not know their policy. After that event, cadres arrived in our village and they educated us. They were doing their propaganda and seizing those people who they wanted to seize. At the beginning, the county government was established in Takar. Some people were put into jails in that area, but we were continually farming on our lands.  After those masters were seized, the policy of (the new government) was that "who plant the lands, who could have it." [Tib. sus btab sus len] So the production of the harvest belonged to servants after the master was shut in.   

**Q:**  Was it the reform?   

**A:**  Yes, it was sort of reform. The reform was begun. However, our master was not very rich. Sometimes he needed to borrow something from others because he had to pay lots of taxes. He had kind of livelihood problems.   

**Q:**  Did he treat you (servants) well?   

**A:**  It was pretty normal. Sometimes he treated very well but sometimes he treated us very bad. It was hard to describe him by one sentence. Then the land was divided into people in later 1959.   

**Q:**  How many lands did you get?   

**A:**  At that time, I had five people in my household and each person was given three mu of lands, so we had fifteen mu of lands.   

**Q:**  Did you get animals?   

**A:**  I got one horse and one cow. Before that time I did not have animals in my home.   

**Q:**  How about the house?   

**A:**  I was living in a small house (or room?) and I got that house. At that time, I was appointed as a tsugdrang.   

**Q:**  What were the jobs for tsugdrang?   

**A:**  Every household was given lands and then organized several households as a group. This group was not so big. Usually it had about fifteen to twenty households.   

**Q:**  Was it the Mutual Aid Team?   

**A:**  Yes, it was. And I was the tsugdrang. I led our team to manage our lands. Moreover, I had to go to the meetings and transmit the policy to the masses. I also transferred the requirements and criticisms of masses to the upper organs, [Tib. gong rim]. At that time, the upper organs could except criticisms and care for about it. The masses listened to leaders and leaders were paying attention to the masses. They were talking about like that, "Correct mistakes if you have made any and guard against them if you have not." [Tib. yod na yo bsrang dang /med na dwogs zon] In 1962, I was told to be the uyön of this xiang.   

**Q:**  What was the name for this xiang?   

**A:**  Chushü Xiang. Before that time, a Peasants Association [Tib. zhing pa mthun grogs tshogs pa] had been established in there for three years. Then it transformed into xiang and I became a uyön of this xiang.   

**Q:**  What did you do in your that position?   

**A:**  The policy of upper organs transmitted to lower organs. We held meetings for group heads. In such meetings, we transmitted the new policies and collected new information included plowing, fertilizing, and watering on lands. We searched how many jobs we had done and how many jobs we needed to do. My jobs were thing like that. After a time about in the 1965 the Culture Revolution was begun. At that point, the rukhag was not established yet. However, they established kind of groups, [Tib. shog khag].   

**Q:**  How many groups did you have?   

**A:**  This was a big village, so it was divided into three groups. It was the basic foundation of rukhag.   

**Q:**  Did those groups have names?   

**A:**  No, but it was called the first group, the second group and the third group. At that time, Yang Yinhua was the leader in this area. He ordered people cut bushes on the mountains and dug sod in order to make fertilizer. After they dug the sod, it was burned for fertilizer. He ordered us did lots of useless projects. Today we know it is very important resources to us, but we had destroyed those things.   

**Q:**  Digging sod was for fertilizer?   

**A:**  Yes. We were forced to make bones into chips for fertilizer. We were also ordered to kill bogs and buried it for fertilizer. While we were doing such things, the Culture Revolution was risen.   

**Q:**  What were people mainly doing during Cultural Revolution?   

**A:**  The upper organs were saying that people should expose the highest people in power who were going on the capitalist road. At that point, there were two groups. The Nyamdre group thought they were the best group and the Gyenlo group thought they were the best group. In the county setting, there was a yard for elephant when they were taking trip. This yard was covered the roof and became a big hall. The big character posters were put on the wall of this hall. People were refuting this person and that person was going on the path of capitalism and the two groups were arguing. People were criticizing something like that, "The adverse current [Tib. chu bo gyen ldog] of May was wrong. Zeng Yongya made mistake to point the artilleries to the Lhasa Jokhang."If today Gyenlo put posters on the walls, Nyamdre put poster on it, in the next day. As the result, the walls of the big hall were covered double and triple by the big character posters. At that time, Wang was the Party Secretary of this qu and Xu was the Vice Party Secretary. They were good men but the policy they were practicing was wrong. Lots of people were writing and putting the big character posters. There were many different people in the (county) government. Some cadres were saying something like that, "I did not get good salary", "I did not get promotion," and "I was not been given position." The cadres were arguing something like that topics. The cadres were teaching something to the masses, but they did not know what actually was going on. As the result, the power of Wang Secretary was taken away. Most people in Takar village were members of Gyenlo and most people in this village were members of Nyamdre. At that time The Second Brigade of Construction [Ch. gong cheng erdui) built their houses and lived in there. It was located behind of the yard of County Department of Armed Forces, [Ch. wu zhuang bu].   

**Q:**  What was the Second Brigade of Construction for?   

**A:**  They were building motorable roads. It also called Bridge Building Brigade [Ch. qiaogong dui] sometimes because they were building bridges. They live in Lhadong Shanka, [Tib. lha gdong shan kha] now, but while they were living around the place where the Big Buddha [Tib. lha chen po] statue was carved on the rock and repairing roads, the Cultural Revolution was risen. Most of them were members of Nyamdre. Only a few were members of Gyenlo. We were also against with Gyenlo. At that time the Second Construction Brigade had many strong people. They used to wear red boots. So, Lhasa people called them "the Red ones" [Tib. dmar khog]. They demonstrated in Lhasa.   

**Q:**  Were they Nyamdre?   

**A:**  Yes, they were. Takar were Gyenlo faction. The Department of Armed Forces moved guns from their apartment to a store and they were robbed by Nyamdre at the night on the road.   

**Q:**  Was the Department of Armed Forces Gyenlo?   

**A:**  Yes, the Department of Armed Forces was Gyenlo. They were going to hide guns but were robbed on the road. Most people in Takar were members of Gyenlo. There was a new cadre in that area. His name was Karma Geleg, [Tib. skar ma dge legs] who came from Tselmey, [Tib. tshal smad] area. He was the head of Gyenlo in this area and he was saying that he was going to support the Ane Gongmey Gyelmo, [Tib. gong ma'i rgyal mo] in Nyemo County. The qu government in this area was set up in an shiga that was built by Shölkhang, [Tib. zhol khang] Household. Dawa la, [Tib. zla ba lags] a member of Road Maintenance Squad, [Ch. yanghu duan] of us, was a member of Nyamdre. He met Karma Geleg in the building of the qu government. Dawa la was just going to climb the first step of the ladder, Karma Geleg shot a gun to him and he immediately fell down on the ground. We immediately went into the house. When I was arrived in there, I saw Karma Geleg was killed in inside of the building. We did not know who shot guns to Karma Geleg. No one knew about it but both of them died in there. Then Nyamdre held a memorial meeting for Dawa la in the county setting. However, no one held memorial meeting for Karma Geleg. At that time, the Party Secretary of Takar Qu was Wang. His wife was born in a Lhasa and at that point, she was in this County. They two fled into Lhasa at that night. The men used to be the highest leader for this area. Before that, when Panchen Rinpoche took trip in this area, he was the person who received in this area. However, during the Cultural Revolution, there were lots of troubles.   

**Q:**  Were there two groups in the Shöl (of Chushü)?   

**A:**  Yes, there were. The local people became two groups and the cadres became two groups. But later some Gyenlo members, both cadres and masses, transferred into the Nyamdre.   

**Q:**  Do you mean that many cadres used to be members of Gyenlo?   

**A:**  Yes, it was true. There were many strange things were happening. Some people were saying they did not get administration positions. You know, some people needed positions like president of the qu, a department or office. Some people were arguing that they did not get promotion their salaries. All of those information was put on the big character posters.   

**Q:**  What was the Nyamdre doing?   

**A:**  We were saying we were Nyamdre and a war was almost going to engage between the two groups. Later (the government) implied that the Nyamdre had been done correctly.   

**Q:**  How long did it take place?   

**A:**  It was kept very long time. The person who lived in my home was the quzhang and the Part Secretary. His name was Pema, [Tib. pad ma]. I went with him to Takar Qu. I also went to Nyamdre's meeting in the Old People's Square [Tib. spo bo gling kha] in Lhasa.   

**Q:**  Really?   

**A:**  Yes, I did.   

**Q:**  When was it?   

**A:**  It was later times (of this movement). The Nyamdre held a big meeting in the Old People's Square. Then all members of Nyamdre and soldiers of the Military Headquarters [Ch. junqu] demonstrated together in Lhasa. Soldiers took artilleries with its shells when we were demonstrating. After this action, the situation became safe.   

**Q:**  Do you remember the name for the leader who held the meeting?   

**A:**  I did not know who was the leader in Lhasa. Some people gave lectures but I could not see clearly who were giving lectures because there were lots of people.   

**Q:**  What did they say on the meeting?   

**A:**  They said we should expose the people who went on the path of capitalism, but should not fight inside of the worker class [Tib. bzo pa' gral rim] because it was useless actions. And they delivered some posters but I am an illiterate.   

**Q:**  How many people went to Lhasa for the meeting? Were you as representative (of Gyenlo)?   

**A:**  Yes, we were the representatives. At that time it was considering a dangerous action. The Cement Factory was Gyenlo group and people were saying that they were blocking the road even though I did not see them (when I went to Lhasa). No one know it was true or fail but were saying that they put members of Nyamdre into it, the machine that grind the stone. It was just a saying. No one saw it.   

**Q:**  Did you ride trucks to Lhasa?   

**A:**  Yes, we went by trucks.   

**Q:**  No one blocked you on the road?   

**A:**  No, but we were extremely worrying about it.   

**Q:**  Later the Red Guard was established, right?   

**A:**  Not, it was established in the beginning. It was in the beginning (of the movement). There was one Red Guard in our village. He died several years age. He went to be soldiers (of PLA) and then got job in Flour Factory [Ch. miam fen chang] (of Lhasa) and he made the long march to China to see Chairman Mao. To be the member of Red Guard, there was an age limited, but many members of Red Guard older then the limited age. For example, I was older then the age limited, but there were two groups and they needed members, so I was given an armband.   

**Q:**  The armband of Red Guard?   

**A:**  Yes.   

**Q:**  What was the duty of Red Guard?   

**A:**  Exposing the people who went on the path of capitalism was the main duty.   

**Q:**  How about the destroying the "demons and monsters" [Tib. lha 'dre gdon bgegs]?   

**A:**  Yes, it was also a duty of Red Guard.   

**Q:**  Did you have to go family to family for searching something?   

**A:**  Yes.   

**Q:**  Searching the monsters and the demons, right?   

**A:**  Yes. Searching the monsters and the demons and antiques and if found antiques, the paper hat was put on the owner's head and took him on the street for demonstrating. People were playing drums and swinging the flags on the air (when they were demonstrating). 
  

**Q:**  Did you go on the street?   

**A:**  No, I did not.   

**Q:**  Oh, were there many things that happened in Chushü during the Cultural Revolution?   

**A:**  Yes, there had a very serious situation.   

**Q:**  Road Maintenance Squad was Nyamdre, was not them?   

**A:**  They were members of Nyamdre. At that time its leader was Chönpel Sonam (Tib. chos 'phel bsod nams).   

**Q:**  There were not many masses to be members of Gyenlo, but most Gyenlo members were cadres, I guess.   

**A:**  Yes, it was true. Most masses were members of Nyamdre. Many cadres were members of Gyenlo, but later most of them transferred into Nyamdre.   

**Q:**  Did they transfer voluntarily?   

**A:**  Yes, it was voluntary.   

**Q:**  Nyamdre did not make troubles to them to be members of Nyamdre, did they?   

**A:**  No, they could transfer in any time.   

**Q:**  (In your memory,) which one was the most serious fighting between the Nyamdre and Gyenlo in Chushü area?   

**A:**  In the county. The county setting had serious situations.   

**Q:**  What happened, for example?   

**A:**  Arguing.   

**Q:**  Some sort of meetings would be held in there, right?   

**A:**  No, there was no one holding meetings. People just went to put new big character posters and then argued about the meaning of the poster. We said we were correct but they said they were correct. So we were arguing for about it.   

**Q:**  Did they fight each other in there?   

**A:**  No, we did not fight at all.   

**Q:**  Later the rukhag was established, right?   

**A:**  The rukhag was established in 1966.   

**Q:**  You said there were three "groups" [Tib. shog khag] and later it might become three rukhags, right?   

**A:**  Yes, it became three rukhag but people could enter the rukhag that they liked. It was their personal choices. Since 1966, I did the dütrang of our rukhag.   

**Q:**  This position must be very hard, I guess.   

**A:**  It was very hard. I even changed diapers for infants who did not have parents. In addition, I had to listen very carefully and then I had to say it to the masses very nicely. It was very hard. As you know, at that time, the livelihood was depended on the work points and my household did not have enough work points to pay that I should pay. So I had to pay back money to the rukhag several years. At that time I fed some pigs and sold it to the Pig Factory. Because I was the dütrang of the rukhag, I had to pay back the money at the first in order to lead the other masses paid back money if they were required. If I did not pay back, the others did not want to give the money that they had to pay back. So, in that case, I had meet big hardships.   

**Q:**  Did you pay back to the rukhag every year?   

**A:**  Yes, I had to pay back every year in several years. Since my children grew up, the hardships of my livelihood became smaller.   

**Q:**  What was the duty of a dütrang of a rukhag?   

**A:**  Leading the masses included planting the fields, attending the meetings, transmitting the policies, sending labors when the government asked. But farming was the main job. It was very busy days. Because our rukhag was very big, I had to go place to place. And there were many different things to do. So, it made me very busy. At that time, we had to hand in the patriotic donation grain.   

**Q:**  I heard that there were two different teams. One is called "working hard" [Tib. dka' sgrub] and "working great" [Tib. che sgrub]? What did these mean?   

**A:**  If the government wanted to open new fields and make original fields bigger, they collected labor workers from all rukhags and it was also called "Shock Team" [Tib. 'phral sgrub pa], and sent them to one rukhag in order to open new fields or for something else. It was not exchanging labors. So many rukhags lost lots of their benefits. If they made this policy carefully, this area probably had big developments. However, they did not research carefully and began the project. For example, a canal was built from the foot of the mountain of Tshabanang area to near the Harasa village. It made us very hard, but this canal was a useless project. It did not give one drop of water for the fields. Moreover, while the project was doing, it was a very cold. We were ordered to do many like that project.   

**Q:**  Was there a person who charged the Shock Team?   

**A:**  Yes, a headman would be sent from the county government. At that time, it was called "working hard and working great", means working hard at first in order to get happy life in the future. It also means forcing to hard work in order to make benefits for the masses, but actually it did not make benefits escaped some lands. At that time, opened or made bigger some lands. Of course, it made benefits to the masses, but it made benefits to a few rukhag, not for every single rukhag.   

**Q:**  Who would give the work points to them?   

**A:**  The rukhag gave work points to them and later had to offer to them the grain.   

**Q:**  Was there two teams in which was called "working hard" and "working great" ?   

**A:**  No, it was one name. It was also called Shock Team in which the most able labors were collected into it. Because the able labor were collected into it, there were not more able labors to harvest and it took long time. Then the upper leader criticized to us but they collected able labors for whole years even it was an autumn. Whatever we were working hard day and night, it was hard to finish our own work quickly.   

**Q:**  You mentioned an elephant yard in Chushü. What was it?   

**A:**  In the old society, the elephant was moved into here (Tibet) from there (India). I heard there were two elephants. After they arrived in Tibet, they needed a place to stay over night on the way, so this yard was built for the two elephants. It did not have a roof. It was the place where the county office building was built today. I heard that one elephant died on the trip, but I saw one elephant arrived in here. This elephant was in Lhasa when the revolt was risen. Before there was a grain store of Tibetan Government and the elephant yard was built close to this store. Later the elephant yard was put roof on it and made it a big meeting room (hall).   

**Q:**  You are an expert about farming. There are three different eras; the Mutual Aid Team era, rukhag era and the gentsang era. Could you compare the three eras and point out which era people were more emphasizing farming production itself?   

**A:**  The Mutual Aid Team era and current policy were pretty similar and it is the best way for farming because the land was given to households. Farming became private sector, so every household managed their lands very carefully. On the other hand, today, even though the land belongs to ourselves, we did not have right to make decision what kind of crops should be planted on our fields. Before we were told that we have right to plant what we want to plant on our fields, but we lost that right. The xiang and village government decided what we should plant. They are practicing the way of planting by an area of multiple plots of land [Tib. gling zhing] rather than individual owned plots of lands. You know, even though I do not want to plant that crop in the area, after the government decided to plant a crop, we had to plant it. We do not have choice. The masses do not like it. But if we do not plant the specific crop, we will be punished. It is not good.  Today we do not have a team in order to exchange our Mutual Aid Team, but it is similar with the Mutual Aid era. We could ask help from others when we need and it is the group as the Mutual Aid Team. We want to plant the crop that we think it is the best crop to plant. But we could not do it now. It is very hard for our farming. For example, we had a kind of red wheat. The seed of the red wheat has been taken from China by Pema Secretary. At the beginning, it only had a small envelope of seeds. Then we planted it in our area and it produced good harvest. This red wheat has been developed from one small envelope to all of this area. Only a few households probably do not have it, but I believe that most households have the red wheat. But since last year, it was prohibited to plant. They said that the red wheat was pig feed of Japanese. They offered another wheat seeds to us and forced us to plant it on our fields. Some households got good harvest but the price of the wheat has been going to decrease.  The seeds can be divided into two different categories. One is light seed and the other is heavy seed. The light seed can be put more water but the heavy seed needs less water. (It should be opposed of his saying.) The red wheat can be put into the light category but the new wheat seed can be put into heavy seed category. The wheat should be planted according to the water condition. But we do not have the right to choose seeds. We have to plant same crop in a same area. On the other hand, our people in this village are very familiar about farming. And usually our lands could produce good harvest. We are managing our lands very carefully. Normally we sweep grasses in our fields at least one times.   

**Q:**  Thank you very much!   

**A:**  You are welcome.   

**Q:**  One more question. How old are you now?   

**A:**  I am 71 years old.   

**Q:**  You are ever healthy.   

**A:**  Until now, I have good heath condition.   

**Q:**  How many people do you have in your household?   

**A:**  We had five people.   

**Q:**  How about your livelihood if you compare with other villagers?   

**A:**  We are in the middle.   

**Q:**  Thank you again!   

**A:**  That's my pleasure.
