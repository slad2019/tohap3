**Q:**  Last time we spoke up to the 1954 period when
                    the Dalai Lama went down to China and the Women's Association had lined up to
                    bid him farewell. So during this time you were at Lhasa, right?   

**A:**  Yes.   

**Q:**  Did Sawangchemmo go with .   

**A:**  He went a little later. There were other
                    Tibetan kudrak who went for a Tour Group and he went as the head of a Tour
                    Group.   

**Q:**  What do you mean by Tour Group?   

**A:**  The group going for a tour. He went down
                    after about 2 weeks. However, at Beijing he was with the Dalai Lama.   

**Q:**  So where were you at that time?   

**A:**  I was in Lhasa.   

**Q:**  You did not go to China?   

**A:**  No, I did not. Taring and Yabshi Lhajam went.   

**Q:**  From the Women's Association?   

**A:**  I don't think it was from the Women's
                    Association. Taring and Yabshi Lhajam went together. Lhajam Gusho at that time
                    was insisting that I go, but I did not. What should I say, I didn't have any
                    work.   

**Q:**  So you have never been to China with a tour
                    group.   

**A:**  No, not at that time. He stayed for a year.
                    [interview ends for the day]   

**Q:**  Yesterday, while we were talking, Kungö came
                    in. So we were speaking about when the Dalai Lama went to China and Sawangchemmo
                    went about two weeks later. And you had not gone, but Taring and Yabshi Lhajam
                    did go. So that's what we were talking about yesterday. So after Sawangchemmo
                    went down and then came up [to Lhasa]. You may have spoken about it, so what was
                    he saying?   

**A:**  You mean when he went down to China?   

**Q:**  Yes.   

**A:**  He said that the Chinese gave the Dalai Lama
                    a fantastic welcome and that they were giving a lot of, what to say khushi,
                         for the officials. Even the servants were
                    getting comfortable places to stay and plenty of food. So he said that they had
                    a good stay. Mainly, since the Dalai Lama was going, they put on a big
                    reception. When the Dalai Lama was there he said that Mao Zedong came to receive
                    him though Sawangchemmo was not with him. 
                        So you had not been down at all? 
 No, not at that time. 
 Did you go later? 
 Later I went when the Dalai Lama went for
                        pilgrimage [to India]. Was it in 1956? 
 Yes. 
 So in 1956 I was sent down to China. They
                        said that there was a national meeting for women and children's health and
                        for that I was to go as the Tibetan women's representative. I took leave,
                        saying that I had no education to become a representative and go to
                        meetings. They would not listen and even Aja Taring told me to come to the
                        office. She said, "This time you younger sister (Tib. Ola [o lags]), it is
                        better to go, please go, she insisted". So I went. I had a servant and there
                        was a Chinese guide. When I went down, I went via the Northern route and we
                        had to go by car, right? So Sawangchemmo had a car provided by the Chinese,
                        so this car was sent with me. It was 11 days up to Lanzhou. At Lanzhou, the
                        Women's Association members came to receive me. I stayed at their office for
                        2 days. Then they sent me on the train to Beijing.  At
                        Beijing, they said it was the place where the youth stayed. It was called
                        something like the Lanzhou Hotel or something. The hotel was not a famous
                        one nor was it poor. I was put up there. I was alone since no one else came
                        from Tibet. I had a servant and I wondered what I was going to do since I
                        didn't know anybody. So at that time, Dönwang [Tib. don dbang] Khenjung was
                        staying there as one of the Khendrönlosum in Beijing. I enquired about him
                        and they said that he was staying at the Dalai Lama's Office (Dalai Bensidru
                        [Ch. ban shi chu]). So I phoned there and since I knew him I said that I
                        have come and I'm alone and so please lend me some assistance. It's a new
                        country and I don't know anyone and since you have stayed around here, so
                        help me. He said, "Wow! [Tib. 'o zi], Lhajam Gusho, you have come. I am
                        coming immediately". He came right away and said what can I help you with. I
                        said at this moment I don't even have an interpreter. Without an
                        interpreter, if I went to a meeting, it wouldn't be good, isn't it? So he
                        told the Women's Office and they assigned an Amdo person. However, I
                        couldn't understand the Amdo dialect. He knew written Tibetan and his
                        Chinese was very good. I think he was a party member. He came for the
                        meeting which was for about 7 days.  During that period
                        they said that I have to give a lecture. I thought to myself that at the
                        least, I have to give a lecture and I had made preparations from Tibet. I
                        also asked Sawangchemmo . So I had brought a speech. However, one had to give a
                        speech according to the situation at that time. Therefore, I told the
                        Women's Association members that today the meeting is about women and
                        children's health so I want to speak about the health of the Lhasa women and
                        what the Women's Association is like and whether there are doctors during
                        child birth and health care. What it was before and what it is now after
                        liberation. So I said, "Should I speak like this? They said," Yes, that's
                        it. We have nothing to advise. Just say like that, but make it a good one."
                        So I said I need a good interpreter. They told me the interpreter is very
                        good. However, I said I don't understand him at all since he is from Amdo.
                        If possible please give me another one. Then they left me somebody who was
                        supposedly a Lhasan called Dan Xiulin. He was Chinese but was a good
                        musician in Tibet who played the Huchin and the big Thechin very well. He
                        had a son. Dan Xiulin and them had come to China during the Guomindang and
                        then later became a cadre. Both his Tibetan and Chinese were good. So I was
                        relieved. Then the meetings began. At first all their chairmen spoke. Later
                        the 5 minority nationality representatives spoke. 
 So what did you say? 
 I said that. At first the larger
                        minorities spoke, then I was the third one. I read in Tibetan about 4 pages.
                        Then Dan Xiulin interpreted this in Chinese. There was so much applause.
                        Since there was a good interpreter, things worked out well. 
 So in your speech did you say that things
                        were like that earlier and now things are very good. 
 One had to say the truth and what the
                        actual situation is. If one lies then it will be discovered. I said what it
                        was earlier. There was no Women's Association and no children's doctors.
                        When women gave child birth there was high mortality. So I spoke about this.
                        Earlier that was the case and now in Tibet after liberation the hospitals
                        were good, the schools also, and especially there are good doctors regarding
                        women's health. These days there are no difficulties with child birth. There
                        is no mortality and both women and child survive well, right? Even when the
                        people are sick the care they received in the People's Hospital was very
                        beneficial. If you take the case of the Women's Association, we had no
                        tradition where women worked. Only men worked in the government with the
                        manorial estate being given for service [Tib. zhab brtan pha gzhis]. The
                        wives just worked in the house and took the responsibilities for the home.
                        Now after liberation, the women went to school and even worked in the office
                        if one had the education. So women have received a lot of rights. And even
                        the education of Tibet has become better. So I told the truth. Then they
                        asked how things were in the villages. I said that in Lhasa things were
                        good, but that in the villages there was nothing -- no doctors and schools
                        and it was just like the old days. 
 So during this time a lot of people went
                        down to China. At that time too the Chinese were quite enthusiastic about
                        the socialist system. 
 They said that was very good. 
 So in that way, some who went down
                        thought that maybe it wasn't too bad. I think that's what they thought, a
                        lot of them. So how was it to you? 
 At that time, what should I say. The
                        essential aspects of the communist system, the traders, the lamas and
                        religion and the elites [Tib. mi drag], they won't leave them, it was said.
                        Only the people. That I have heard long time ago and wondered whether here
                        would be difficulties later. At that time, they said that everything in the
                        17-Point Agreement is as it is, so if it stayed that way, then I thought it
                        would be good. At that time I did not think that it would change. 
 At that time, what was Sawangchemmo
                        thinking -- around 1952, 53? The way I see it, those who were working for
                        the government thought the agreement was already signed, nobody was helping
                        from the outside and the Chinese were saying that everything would remain as
                        before and so, they thought, well maybe it wasn't so bad after all. A lot
                        thought that way. 
 Yes, they thought that way? 
 What did Sawangchemmo think? 
 He didn't believe in it too much. He said
                        that now it was good but gradually there was no alternative except to
                        change. The main idea of Marxism, which is practiced by Mao, is the road we
                        have to travel. So later it will become difficult. 
 At Lhasa what were you doing at the
                        Women's Association. 
 I was an Uyön? 
 How many Uyön were there? 
 There were 30 odd Uyön. 
 What was Taring Mola? 
 She was a Zhuren. The highest Zhuren was
                        Yabshi Lhajam, Ngabö Lhajam and then Taring Lhajam. Then there was a Chinese
                        lady who was higher than them. Should I say higher since they had the same
                        rank, however she had all the power . 
 Now at Lhasa, there were about 30 Uyön
                        and then there were the Zhuren and so why did you go? 
 At that time I did not know? 
 What did Taring Mola say? 
 She said, "This time, Ola, you must go,
                        the Chinese will not listen, only you, ola, must go, others won't do". Let
                        me first tell you about what happened at Beijing. So I went and had the
                        meeting for seven days. After the meetings were over, there were the
                        parties. Then they asked me what I wanted to do? I said, "I want to go for a
                        tour". They asked where I wanted to go. I said to 3 or 4 famous places. So
                        they sent me for a tour, myself, the Chinese lady, the interpreter and my
                        servant. We went to Hangzhou, Shanghai, Nanjing. It took about two weeks.
                        Then on my return I was staying at the same hotel that we had stayed
                        previously. While at the hotel, they told me I have to go to the Beijing
                        Hotel. That had a huge restaurant, a famous one where the Dalai Lama had
                        stayed. So they kept me there. I was wondering why they did that, kept me at
                        Beijing Hotel. So I went there. Then a Chinese came and said, "Tomorrow you
                        have to meet Chairman Mao". My God! [Tib. 'o dzi] I was startled. I said,
                        alright what time. He said at 10.30. So I said - What should I say.  Then I called Dönwang Kungö and asked him to come over.
                        He came and I told him that just now a Chinese man came and told me that I
                        have to meet Chairman Mao. So, kungö, you please advise me on how to meet
                        Chairman Mao. I have not had such meeting. He said, " I see, so this is very
                        important work, so Lhajam Gusho, you have to talk nicely and not say
                        anything excessive [Tib. thal cha] and reckless [Tib. gang byung mang
                        byung]". Of course, I was not going to. He told me to dress properly and
                        clean since you are our Tibetan Sawang's wife, so you have to go nicely.  So the next day I waited and waited. Then they said that
                        the meeting was not today but tomorrow . I thought that I had nothing to say
                        since I had nothing to do with the government. The Chinese had sent me just
                        as a representative. So I wondered what I should say. Then I thought, well,
                        whatever he says I will reply to it. So in my mind I had it all prepared. So
                        tomorrow at 10:30 a car came and I went in that. 
 Where was the meeting? 
 At his residence. I think it was close
                        by. However, it was a large place and outside I was given a khata nangdzö
                        [Tib. nang mdzod] which was to be given to Chairman Mao. I said, "Okay, and
                        went up. There were people from the Miao nationality. There were many,
                        around 20. So as I went in I gave the khata and he shook hands. They took a
                        lot of photographs. Then we were sitting in order. Next to Mao was a leader,
                        then the Zhuren of the National Women's Association [Tib. rgyal yongs bud
                        med], then me. So they took photographs. After that, he waved his hand in
                        goodbye gesture to the Miao people. I was told to come up. There was the
                        relative of Phünwang Buzhang [Phüntso Wangyal], Thutob [Tib. mthu stobs] or
                        something like that. He said " Lhajam Gusho don't leave". So I went in. The
                        sitting room was rather a small one. At that time Deng Xiaoping was there,
                        then there was another bearded one called Wang Feng or something like that.
                        Then there was the Zhuren of the National Women's Association,the biggest
                        one and myself and Phünwang Buzhang la's relative. 
                        Chairman Mao told me to sit next to him. He was seated like this and he said
                        to sit there. I said no and sat lower down. Then he said to have a
                        cigarette. I said I don't smoke. Then he lit one up. He asked me how I came?
                        I said I came by car via the northern route through Garmu and then took the
                        train. He asked me how the road was. I replied that the road was not
                        completed. There was the Thangula Pass, or whatever it is called, and they
                        were in the process of constructing it. The weather was cold I added. Then
                        he asked, when you came to Beijing it seems that you went for a tour- so how
                        were things. I said that it was very good. He asked whether in Tibet the
                        Chinese were teasing [Tib. brnyas brko] the women in the Women's
                        Association. I said, no they weren't. Even if they did, whatever the monks
                        said to us, we would not respond [Tib. ya lab slog]. I said that the Tibetan
                        people are very religious and patient. I said that after liberation you have
                        said that the religion and the Dalai Lama's status will remain. So for this
                        I am happy and the people of Tibet are happy. So please do your best to
                        continue . Then he
                        asked how many women were there . I replied about 200 since Lhasa was not
                        big and so there are not that many as here. So what was your perception of
                        China, he asked. I said,"I have never seen China before so these days, what
                        should I say, it is like the work done by the cadres of Tibet after
                        liberation. The clothes of the men and women are the same". So that's what I
                        said. Then they said to have some Chinese tea [Tib. qing cha]. So I said I
                        will take leave. He said to stay for a while. So I stayed for a while and
                        then left. He came all the way down to accompany me. From his room to the
                        door of the large house. He was shaking my hands and saying "good, good"
                        [Ch. hao hao].  During this time the Dalai Lama was in
                        India for the Buddha Jayanti. A day or two later while I was staying at the
                        hotel, a man came from the Minorities Office or some other office. He asked
                        me to write a letter to Sawangchemmo telling him that he should not stay in a
                        foreign country for very long since there are a lot of American and English
                        imperialist spies. They will make trouble and even put the personal safety
                        of the Dalai Lama in danger. So they said I have to write a letter. I asked
                        where Sawangchemmo was. He said that at this moment they had gone for a
                        pilgrimage and that if I gave the letter to him, then it would get there
                        immediately. So they said that I had to write a letter. Then, I suspected
                        and thought, "I see, the reason they sent me to China was that they thought
                        that Sawangchemmo would definitely stay in India. It was for this reason." 
 When you came down to China, Sawangchemmo
                        was in Lhasa, right? 
 You mean the Dalai Lama? 
 The Dalai Lama and company had not left
                        for India by then, right? 
 When? 
 No. You had to go down for health matters
                        of the women's group, right? So, when was this, when the Dalai Lama was
                        going to India [answer not finished] 
 It was at the time the Dalai Lama was
                        going to India. 
 At the time? About how many days? 
 When the Dalai Lama was scheduled to
                        leave for India in about 3 weeks time, it was then that I went to China. 
 I see, that many . 
 Anyway, when the Dalai Lama was in India,
                        I was in China. 
 So did they, [people] like Taring say
                        that you and only you have to go down to China? 
 You mean others? I was told that the
                        Chinese said that I have to go. Tan Zhuren himself said so, I was told. Tan
                        Zhuren was the main leader of the Women's Association. 
 So do you think that you had to go down
                        to China because they thought that Sawangchemmo would stay? 
 I think so, but this is only my
                        suspicion. 
 Yes. 
 So that's what I thought, because there
                        was no need for me to go, isn't it? 
 Yes, specially meeting Mao [answer not
                        finished] 
 They could have sent anyone. There were
                        so many other educated ones. There was Samling, Tsögo. 
 So did you write the letter? 
 The letter, I said I will sent it myself. 
 So what did he say? [Did he say] that
                        that was not okay? 
 He said you absolutely must [Tib. yin
                        gcig min gcig] send it. Then, the day after the meeting with Mao, it seems
                        that the Dalai Lama was in Gangtok. There was this Chinese interpreter
                        called Li Zhuren [Li Zuomin] who spoke Tibetan. At around 11, he approached
                        Sawangchemmo with the newspaper with photographs and said, "Oh look! Lhajam
                        Gusho has met Chairman Mao and spoke very well. That everything went so well
                        with Chairman Mao and he was so pleased with Lhajam Gusho. That Lhajam Gusho
                        was very lucky indeed." 
 So did you not have to write the letter? 
 Who? 
 They said that you had to write a letter
                        to Sawangchemmo. Did you write the letter? 
 I wrote one asking him to come back soon. 
 So you sent that? 
 He did not receive it. I didn't write
                        anything in detail. 
 So later when Sawangchemmo came from
                        Gangtok and [answer not finished] 
 Because the real situation is what the
                        government wants to do and we insignificant women, what we say,does not
                        matter. So I did not say much just that things were fine. 
 Were they not insisting that you send the
                        letter. 
 No, not that much. They were being
                        appropriate [Tib. spam po] and not paying much attention [Tib. snang
                            med]. 
 Before that had other women's members met
                        Chairman Mao? 
 Before that I had not been on any tours. 
 No, I mean other members of the Women's
                        Association. 
 Yes, they went. 
 And did they meet Mao Zedong? 
 No, never. This was the first time. That
                        was stated in the paper. So during this time Sawangchemmo was in India and it
                        was just to show that Chairman Mao was so happy. 
 So when Sawangchemmo returned later, what
                        did he say? Did he say he saw it? 

 Yes, he said he saw it and I think he
                        showed it to everyone 
                        saying that Chairman Mao really liked Lhajam Gusho . People thought that
                        I had said all kinds of excessive [Tib. thal cha] and reckless [Tib. gang
                        byung mang byung] things to Chairman Mao. In Lhasa people were saying such
                        things like "Wow! You must have talked with the Chairman Mao very well." I
                        did not say such things. It's what I have already told you. 
 Then you came to Lhasa? So from the time
                        that the person asked you to write, then where did you go? 
 Then they asked me what I wanted to do. I
                        said I didn't want to stay very long. Taking everything into consideration,
                        since I went on tour it had already been more than two months, so I said
                        that I heard that there were some important pilgrimage sites around Beijing
                        and I would like to visit these. For example, the stupa where the Lord
                        Buddhas tooth was kept, and the Tsuglagang of 500 arhats [Tib. dgra bcom
                        lnga brgya] and Yonghe Monastery. So I went to these and many others and
                        then we returned. Yuthok Lhajam Gusho had fervently requested me to bring
                        Sichöla [Tib. sri chod lags] [her son] with me. He was in Beijing at that
                        time. So we were together. Now think about at this, they sent us from
                        Lanzhou by plane. Myself, Sichöla, the Chinese women and my servant-- that's
                        all that there were on the plane. 
 You mean the whole plane? 
 Yes, the whole plane. 
 With just 3 persons. 
 Four of us. So after meeting Mao Zedong,
                        later too they showed how nice they were and they took us all the way to Dam
                        [Tib. 'dam] [the site of the airport]. The plane was a military one. 
 So by then, the airfield had moved from
                        Nagchu to Dam? 
 Yes. There was no airfield at Nagchu. 
 Wasn't there one at Namru [Tib. gnam ru]? 
 It was at Dam. In the plane there was a
                        hostess and they served tea and food. 
 Did you enjoy the food? 
 Yes, it was delicious. Then when we got
                        to Dam we stayed for quite some time. We got to Dam at around 4 and so we
                        stayed till about 7, resting. The pilots had a hotel to stay in. It was so
                        nice. The food and all must be something special for the pilots. There we
                        had a full course meal. We reached Dam at around 3-4 p.m and we stayed there
                        till 7 p.m. Then we went to Lhasa. It took about 3 hours. Then there was a
                        Trekhang estate, what's it called- there was one at Yamda [Tib. yab mda'],
                        called Mami. At about that spot there were people sent [from Surkhang] to
                        receive us. One car and Kungö Rimshi came. Then we went up [to Lhasa]. 
 When you went from Dam to Lhasa, then
                        what happened? 
 When I arrived at Lhasa I rested for a
                        few days. Then they asked me to come to the Women's Association office. All
                        the Uyön had gathered. The Standing Committee members were there and so were
                        all the Zhuren and the Uyön. Then they asked to me say what I did when I
                        went to China. So I related all in detail. 
 The newspaper regarding your visit must
                        have already been seen at Lhasa, right? 
 Yes, they had seen it. They said that it
                        was advertised all over Lhasa. They were astounded, saying you have met
                        Chairman Mao and said a lot of things. I said we didn't talk much. Whatever
                        he asked me, I replied. 
 So at the meeting you said something. 
 Yes, I gave a report. I had a good time,
                        went on a tour, everyday I was entertained, went boating even though there
                        were only four of us. At Shanghai, Sambo kungö and others were there. I met
                        my sister Tsade [Tib. tsha sde]. They had come for a tour. 
 Did you have any conversation with them. 
 At that time, I had not met Mao. "Oh, it
                        is amazing that you had the courage to come alone" [They] said. They should
                        have sent at least one other. 
 So it was 1956, almost 1957, and so at
                        that time compared to what it was before, did things get worse. 
 From around 1957 things got worse. The
                        Chinese must be getting suspicious since they were making preparations for
                        war. 
 Since the time you went down until when
                        you returned, was it different? 
 No, not that much, but in front of Drip
                        Tsecholing [Tib. grib tshe mchog gling] a lot of soldiers were coming and
                        there were arms shipments. This was at night. During this time, it seems
                        that in the Kham area the revolt had started, so the Chinese thought that in
                        the ü area the same thing would happen and made a lot of preparations. Then
                        the Tibetans got suspicious. 
 In 1954 the Dalai Lama went down and in
                        1955, the Chinese were saying that in the Kham areas the big lamas went and
                        incited the people. 
 Yes it was said that they said like that.
                        Yes, I have heard it. They said that during a lecture. 
 Anyway, whatever, if they were saying
                        such things in 1956 then the situation must have been getting worse. Then
                        from the Kham area, a lot of people must be coming up [to Lhasa]. 
 Yes, seems that a lot of them were coming
                        up. The war had started down there and they fled from there and stayed in
                        Lhasa and started the Chushigandru. 
 That sort of started a little later. 
 Yes, so they became big. They held the
                        whole of the south, in Lhoka. 
 Just before that, was there any
                        disturbance in Lhasa causing a situation where the Khambas could not stay in
                        Lhasa. Was there talk that they must be sent down [back to Kham]? 
 You mean the Chinese? 
 Yes. 
 The Chinese were saying this all the
                        time, but that the [Tibetan] government also wouldn't let them. 
 So in Lhasa some said that around Lhasa
                        the Chinese were making preparations, doing target practice. They fortified
                        their houses with sand bags and were getting ready. 
 This was just before the Dalai Lama
                        returned. 
 So before the Dalai Lama returned from
                        India they made bunkers. 
 The bunkers were always there. 
 From earlier on? 
 Yes, from about a month before he
                        returned. 
 No. no. What about 1952,53. 
 No, not at that time. When Chushigandru
                        went to the south, that's when a lot of bunkers were set up in Lhasa. 
 Were the bunkers only around their
                        offices or everywhere. 
 Around their offices, to protect them. 
 Then there were talks that the Tibetan
                        soldiers had a fight with the Chinese soldiers. Have you heard anything like
                        that? 
 No I haven't. 
 That there was some shooting and somebody
                        got shot-- that during Mönlam a man with a bomb was arrested. 
 Did they say that? 
 Yes there was some talk like that. 
 Must be, I don't know. 
 After Sawangchemmo returned  what did he say. For
                        example, what did he say they talked about? 
 If  stayed in Tibet then the dangerous time
                        had come. The Chinese were increasing. The Chushigandru had revolted. So,
                        that's what he was thinking. It would not be peaceful in Tibet. There were
                        70 government officials, the most trusted ones, and they had a meeting
                            . 
 70 officials were selected? 
 Yes, both lay and monk officials. 
 When was this? 
 In 1958. 
 The uprising was in the [question not
                        finished] 
 It was in 1959. 
 I see, so now we have come to 1959? 
 I think it was around the 1st month of
                        1959. The Dalai Lama left in the 3rd month. 
 So 2 months before? 
 Probably, something like that. So the
                        officials, it is said, made a pledge not to tell anyone. Made a big pledge.
                        At the meeting the main speaker was Sawangchemmo. He said that we have
                        reached a very dangerous point. If we just hang around thinking that things
                        will be alright, then if the Dalai Lama comes under the Chinese it would be
                        just terrible. Tibet will later be gone completely [Tib. rtsa brlag]. So we
                        must take the Dalai Lama abroad. So if we did that, then what do you all
                        think, give me your opinions because that is what I think. He told me that's
                        what he said. I don't know what the others said. I can't tell you. Most said
                        it was a good idea, that the Dalai Lama should leave. That the Dalai Lama
                        should think about it. 
 So in the meeting [question not finished] 
 In the meeting Kungö Tsögo one or two
                        others who worked for the Chinese were there. It was said that they reported
                        about the meeting to the Chinese and the impossibility of Tibetan- Chinese
                        friendly relations. Then Tsögo did not come to the meetings anymore saying
                        that he wished to take leave and he and about 3 kudrak took leave.
                        Sawangchemmo had to go and the Chinese learned about all the discussions.
                        Sawangchemmo was the main person and the Chinese were very angry. So this
                        meeting was going on and then there was another large Chinese meeting. At
                        that meeting, there the Dalai Lama's 2 tutors were present. It is said that
                        the Dalai Lama was invited also, but he didn't go. All the kudrak were
                        there, the youth and the women's [association members] and prominent people
                        from the general public. The Chinese gave lectures, the 2 tutors also and
                        when it was Sawangchemmo's turn to give a lecture, he didn't stay. 
 Was this at a Preparatory Committee for
                        the Tibet Autonomous Region meeting? 
 On the one hand, the Dalai Lama should
                        not stay. This is what Sawangchemmo was saying. On the other hand when they
                             wanted him to give
                        a lecture, then what was he going to say? It is not possible to say
                        anything. He was in great difficulty, wasn't he? So at the Chinese meeting,
                        when the Chinese tell Surkhang Kalön to give a lecture, what is he going to
                        say? 
 So when it was his time to speak, he
                        didn't stay? 
 He didn't speak and he came home. 
 During the meeting? So what did he say? 
 He just got up and left. He didn't say a
                        thing. Without speaking, he came home. He said he didn't stay at the
                        meeting. So the next day and after that they were saying that the Chinese
                        leader Tan Zhuren was furious and at the meeting he banged his fists on the
                        table and said, "That's right, this Surkhang Kalön is like that. This man,
                        up to this day, has not done a single thing to benefit China. Everything, we
                        have noted down, the year, the month ,the day and the hour. So today he did
                        like that, didn't give a lecture and left". It is said that he [Tan Zhuren]
                        said a lot. "This person is the kind of person who should be punished
                        publicly. We will never just let things be. Today is the first warning. Do
                        it 3 times and we will arrest him". In one way it was good since he found
                        some cleverness.  A lot of kudrak came to the house saying
                        that this is very serious and what are you going to do. You should flee.
                        There were many who told him that. Also they said that if he stayed here
                        they will never let him stay nicely. 
 Who came to the house to say these
                        things? Was it kudrak and were there any from monasteries, traders? 
 Some of our khamtsen monks came. Then
                        Janglojen Gung [Tib. lcang lo can gung], Kungö Sambo, then Kujar and many
                        others. Then the kudrak said that all of us officials are going to have a
                        meeting and we will not hand in Sawangchemmo. If something happens to him
                        then we want the same thing to happen to us. We will never give him up. So
                        it is said that they met. 
 So they had a meeting? 
 Yes, they had one, saying that they will
                        not hand in Sawangchemmo. They secretly talked about it and sent the message
                        to the three great monasteries and all. 
 Did they have a place that they met or
                        how was it? 
 They would go from house to house. Most
                        government officials. Sawangchemmo they said is the main person who
                        challenges the Chinese and we will not let him go from our hands. 

 Was it yesterday or the day before when
                        we spoke about the meeting of the 70 odd officials at Shöl or some place.
                        Then at another meeting, a Chinese meeting, Sawangchemmo didn't speak and
                        just left. Then after that Tibetans said that they would not hand in
                        Sawangchemmo. So we had reached that point. So at that time the Chinese
                        scolded Sawangchemmo and said they were going to do something. So at that
                        time did they meet? 
 The Tibetans? 
 Yes. 
 Yes they met and it is said that they
                        were not going to hand him over to the Chinese. A lot of people also came to
                        see us, kudrak came, saying Sawangchemmo be alert since the Chinese are
                        furious. They said that they were going to arrest him. 
 Then what happened after that. Was there
                        some meeting of the monasteries or not? 
 They spoke among themselves and I think
                        they discussed this a lot. However, there was no starting of a widespread
                        group with meetings. The Chinese also said that their scolding of
                        Sawangchemmo had really alarmed the people. A lot of people were feeling
                        unbearable. The monasteries were also sending messages. So it seems that the
                        Chinese heard all this. So they were also suspicious, probably thinking that
                        all of a sudden there may be some unrest. If this happened, all people would
                        rise up and the Chinese had not finished their war preparations so for the
                        time being they may have said that it would be better to cool things down. I
                        think they thought that.  So one day Li Chuzhang [Li
                        Zuomin] came to see Sawangchemmo. He was a Chinese who spoke Tibetan, did
                        interpreting and was also a notable cadre. He asked Sawangchemmo to come to
                        the Military Headquarters [Ch. si ling bu] as Tan [Guansan] Zhuren had
                        requested him to come. Sawangchemmo said, "What is it about?". "Nothing, he
                        wants to talk a little with you". Deep inside I think he wondered what it
                        was about --going to the military headquarters. However, he just went kind
                        of without paying attention [Tib. snang med]. 
 He didn't say anything? 
 He took a servant and went. 
 Who was the servant? 
 It was the Drönyer Tsering Pembar [Tib.
                        tshe ring dpal 'bar]. The Chinese leader had come near to the door and said,
                        "Oh, Surkhang Kalön has come." and acted so pleased. He told him to come in
                        and shook hands. They sat in the sitting room and tea and snacks were served
                        Tan Zhuren said, "I had to scold you last time and for that you must have
                        been very angry. So please don't be disappointed with that. If a very close
                        friend is about to fall from the cliff, it is our duty to pull him up. You
                        have made mistakes in your work. You are among the better and more educated
                        Tibetan Government officials, so when you make such mistakes, we feel a
                        great loss. So we have pulled you up as you were about to fall into the
                        abyss. So please don't be angry, [Ch. dui bu qi] he said. 
 [Ch. dui bu qi] means? 
 "I'm sorry." So he continued, "At that
                        time, when it was your turn to speak, you didn't stay. It was one of our big
                        meetings, not just a small one. So that was a big mistake. And at that time
                        I was very angry. However, after thinking it over, we have to be mutually
                        friendly. We just said those things, but we won't do anything like that." So
                        Sawangchemmo must have said, alright, alright. So he said that that was what
                        was said at the Military Headquarters. We were so afraid, thinking that they
                        will not let him return. They would not take him by force, but just ask him
                        to come matter-of-factly. I thought that they would keep him there and not
                        allow him to come home. We were so afraid. Then he came quite soon. It
                        didn't take very long. He said, "Wow! they were saying like that". 
 Last time you were saying that Sichöla
                        was in China. At that at was he not going to school in India? 
 No, he was not. Sichöla, Dündül la [Tib.
                        bdud 'dul lags] and about 15 other kudrak children were at the Nationality
                        Institute [Tib. mi rigs slob grwa] in Beijing. Sichöla was at the school and
                        Dündül la went as part of the football team to China. He went to play
                        football  in China. 
 Then in 1956-57 were there any going to
                        school in India. 
 No, they were all going down to China
                        then. Most of them would not dare to go. 
 Last time, when I was talking to my
                        father he said that those who were staying in Darjeeling and Kalimpong were
                        told that it was not good to send children to school in India and that they
                        were trying to have them send them to Tibet. At first they were in school in
                        India and then [question not finished] 
 Yes, the Chinese said not to leave the
                        children in India and that they should be withdraw [from school]. I think
                        that's what they said. They were withdrawn. 
 So at first they were going to school,
                        right? 
 Yes, there were many. Three from
                        Kapshöba, and then there was Sumdo [Tib. gsum mdo], and quite a few? 
 From your family? 
 JT, Yuthok Sichöla, Jigmela, Dündül la,
                        Yabshi Langdun Pemala [Tib. glang mdun pad ma lags] and them, Ngabö's three
                        children. There were many. 
 So the Chinese were saying that they have
                        to go back? 
 They were saying not to sent them there.
                        Schools have been established in Tibet so send them to school in Tibet.
                        There is no need to know the English language, just Tibetan and Chinese is
                        sufficient. 
 Who was it, JT-la or Chundenla [Tib. chos
                        ldan lags] or who? 
 Chundenla was there. 
 Then she came up. 
 Yes. 
 I recall something about either Yangjenla
                        [Tib. dbyangs can lags] or somebody who in 1957 [question not finished] 
 Then the Tsarong girls were there,
                        Tsering Drolmala [Tib. tshe ring sgrol ma lags], Thöndrub Drolmala [Tib. don
                        grub sgrol ma lags], they were there. Then they went back and Namla and
                        others attended the Society School [Tib. spyi tshogs slob grwa]. 
 Then a lot of us went to school in India
                        again in 1956, 1957. I went to school in 1957. 
 I see. 
 Didn't anyone from your family come down? 
 JT la and others went in 1957 again. 
 In 1957. Did they go to study or did they
                        go at the time the Dalai Lama came to India? 
 They went when the Dalai Lama went to
                        India and then did not return. Yangjenla and they went after this. 
 Yangchen and who? 
 Chundenla went from India to that side
                            . She went to the
                        Society School for about 3 or 4 years. Then she came to India again. 
 What year was that? 
 That was in 1957 and Yangjen was also
                        sent you know? When the Queen mother of Sikkim returned they were sent with
                        her. 
 So were they sent for the purposes of
                        study or was there a feeling that the situation was not good. 
 The situation was also not so good. The
                        Khamba revolt had begun and they were coming up [to Lhasa]. We thought
                        things wouldn't be good in Lhasa so they were sent. Whatever may be, we
                        thought it was better to send the children to India since it was a free
                        country. Chundenla went as the companion of Yangjen. Surkhang Khenjung was
                        always in India. In 1957 when the Dalai Lama went for the Buddha Jayanti,
                        since then he [Surkhang Khenjung] stayed in India. 

  

**Q:** 
                        So you had not been down at all?   

**A:**  No, not at that time.   

**Q:**  Did you go later?   

**A:**  Later I went when the Dalai Lama went for
                        pilgrimage [to India]. Was it in 1956?   

**Q:**  Yes.   

**A:**  So in 1956 I was sent down to China. They
                        said that there was a national meeting for women and children's health and
                        for that I was to go as the Tibetan women's representative. I took leave,
                        saying that I had no education to become a representative and go to
                        meetings. They would not listen and even Aja Taring told me to come to the
                        office. She said, "This time you younger sister (Tib. Ola [o lags]), it is
                        better to go, please go, she insisted". So I went. I had a servant and there
                        was a Chinese guide. When I went down, I went via the Northern route and we
                        had to go by car, right? So Sawangchemmo had a car provided by the Chinese,
                        so this car was sent with me. It was 11 days up to Lanzhou. At Lanzhou, the
                        Women's Association members came to receive me. I stayed at their office for
                        2 days. Then they sent me on the train to Beijing.  At
                        Beijing, they said it was the place where the youth stayed. It was called
                        something like the Lanzhou Hotel or something. The hotel was not a famous
                        one nor was it poor. I was put up there. I was alone since no one else came
                        from Tibet. I had a servant and I wondered what I was going to do since I
                        didn't know anybody. So at that time, Dönwang [Tib. don dbang] Khenjung was
                        staying there as one of the Khendrönlosum in Beijing. I enquired about him
                        and they said that he was staying at the Dalai Lama's Office (Dalai Bensidru
                        [Ch. ban shi chu]). So I phoned there and since I knew him I said that I
                        have come and I'm alone and so please lend me some assistance. It's a new
                        country and I don't know anyone and since you have stayed around here, so
                        help me. He said, "Wow! [Tib. 'o zi], Lhajam Gusho, you have come. I am
                        coming immediately". He came right away and said what can I help you with. I
                        said at this moment I don't even have an interpreter. Without an
                        interpreter, if I went to a meeting, it wouldn't be good, isn't it? So he
                        told the Women's Office and they assigned an Amdo person. However, I
                        couldn't understand the Amdo dialect. He knew written Tibetan and his
                        Chinese was very good. I think he was a party member. He came for the
                        meeting which was for about 7 days.  During that period
                        they said that I have to give a lecture. I thought to myself that at the
                        least, I have to give a lecture and I had made preparations from Tibet. I
                        also asked Sawangchemmo . So I had brought a speech. However, one had to give a
                        speech according to the situation at that time. Therefore, I told the
                        Women's Association members that today the meeting is about women and
                        children's health so I want to speak about the health of the Lhasa women and
                        what the Women's Association is like and whether there are doctors during
                        child birth and health care. What it was before and what it is now after
                        liberation. So I said, "Should I speak like this? They said," Yes, that's
                        it. We have nothing to advise. Just say like that, but make it a good one."
                        So I said I need a good interpreter. They told me the interpreter is very
                        good. However, I said I don't understand him at all since he is from Amdo.
                        If possible please give me another one. Then they left me somebody who was
                        supposedly a Lhasan called Dan Xiulin. He was Chinese but was a good
                        musician in Tibet who played the Huchin and the big Thechin very well. He
                        had a son. Dan Xiulin and them had come to China during the Guomindang and
                        then later became a cadre. Both his Tibetan and Chinese were good. So I was
                        relieved. Then the meetings began. At first all their chairmen spoke. Later
                        the 5 minority nationality representatives spoke.   

**Q:**  So what did you say?   

**A:**  I said that. At first the larger
                        minorities spoke, then I was the third one. I read in Tibetan about 4 pages.
                        Then Dan Xiulin interpreted this in Chinese. There was so much applause.
                        Since there was a good interpreter, things worked out well.   

**Q:**  So in your speech did you say that things
                        were like that earlier and now things are very good.   

**A:**  One had to say the truth and what the
                        actual situation is. If one lies then it will be discovered. I said what it
                        was earlier. There was no Women's Association and no children's doctors.
                        When women gave child birth there was high mortality. So I spoke about this.
                        Earlier that was the case and now in Tibet after liberation the hospitals
                        were good, the schools also, and especially there are good doctors regarding
                        women's health. These days there are no difficulties with child birth. There
                        is no mortality and both women and child survive well, right? Even when the
                        people are sick the care they received in the People's Hospital was very
                        beneficial. If you take the case of the Women's Association, we had no
                        tradition where women worked. Only men worked in the government with the
                        manorial estate being given for service [Tib. zhab brtan pha gzhis]. The
                        wives just worked in the house and took the responsibilities for the home.
                        Now after liberation, the women went to school and even worked in the office
                        if one had the education. So women have received a lot of rights. And even
                        the education of Tibet has become better. So I told the truth. Then they
                        asked how things were in the villages. I said that in Lhasa things were
                        good, but that in the villages there was nothing -- no doctors and schools
                        and it was just like the old days.   

**Q:**  So during this time a lot of people went
                        down to China. At that time too the Chinese were quite enthusiastic about
                        the socialist system.   

**A:**  They said that was very good.   

**Q:**  So in that way, some who went down
                        thought that maybe it wasn't too bad. I think that's what they thought, a
                        lot of them. So how was it to you?   

**A:**  At that time, what should I say. The
                        essential aspects of the communist system, the traders, the lamas and
                        religion and the elites [Tib. mi drag], they won't leave them, it was said.
                        Only the people. That I have heard long time ago and wondered whether here
                        would be difficulties later. At that time, they said that everything in the
                        17-Point Agreement is as it is, so if it stayed that way, then I thought it
                        would be good. At that time I did not think that it would change.   

**Q:**  At that time, what was Sawangchemmo
                        thinking -- around 1952, 53? The way I see it, those who were working for
                        the government thought the agreement was already signed, nobody was helping
                        from the outside and the Chinese were saying that everything would remain as
                        before and so, they thought, well maybe it wasn't so bad after all. A lot
                        thought that way.   

**A:**  Yes, they thought that way?   

**Q:**  What did Sawangchemmo think?   

**A:**  He didn't believe in it too much. He said
                        that now it was good but gradually there was no alternative except to
                        change. The main idea of Marxism, which is practiced by Mao, is the road we
                        have to travel. So later it will become difficult.   

**Q:**  At Lhasa what were you doing at the
                        Women's Association.   

**A:**  I was an Uyön?   

**Q:**  How many Uyön were there?   

**A:**  There were 30 odd Uyön.   

**Q:**  What was Taring Mola?   

**A:**  She was a Zhuren. The highest Zhuren was
                        Yabshi Lhajam, Ngabö Lhajam and then Taring Lhajam. Then there was a Chinese
                        lady who was higher than them. Should I say higher since they had the same
                        rank, however she had all the power .   

**Q:**  Now at Lhasa, there were about 30 Uyön
                        and then there were the Zhuren and so why did you go?   

**A:**  At that time I did not know?   

**Q:**  What did Taring Mola say?   

**A:**  She said, "This time, Ola, you must go,
                        the Chinese will not listen, only you, ola, must go, others won't do". Let
                        me first tell you about what happened at Beijing. So I went and had the
                        meeting for seven days. After the meetings were over, there were the
                        parties. Then they asked me what I wanted to do? I said, "I want to go for a
                        tour". They asked where I wanted to go. I said to 3 or 4 famous places. So
                        they sent me for a tour, myself, the Chinese lady, the interpreter and my
                        servant. We went to Hangzhou, Shanghai, Nanjing. It took about two weeks.
                        Then on my return I was staying at the same hotel that we had stayed
                        previously. While at the hotel, they told me I have to go to the Beijing
                        Hotel. That had a huge restaurant, a famous one where the Dalai Lama had
                        stayed. So they kept me there. I was wondering why they did that, kept me at
                        Beijing Hotel. So I went there. Then a Chinese came and said, "Tomorrow you
                        have to meet Chairman Mao". My God! [Tib. 'o dzi] I was startled. I said,
                        alright what time. He said at 10.30. So I said - What should I say.  Then I called Dönwang Kungö and asked him to come over.
                        He came and I told him that just now a Chinese man came and told me that I
                        have to meet Chairman Mao. So, kungö, you please advise me on how to meet
                        Chairman Mao. I have not had such meeting. He said, " I see, so this is very
                        important work, so Lhajam Gusho, you have to talk nicely and not say
                        anything excessive [Tib. thal cha] and reckless [Tib. gang byung mang
                        byung]". Of course, I was not going to. He told me to dress properly and
                        clean since you are our Tibetan Sawang's wife, so you have to go nicely.  So the next day I waited and waited. Then they said that
                        the meeting was not today but tomorrow . I thought that I had nothing to say
                        since I had nothing to do with the government. The Chinese had sent me just
                        as a representative. So I wondered what I should say. Then I thought, well,
                        whatever he says I will reply to it. So in my mind I had it all prepared. So
                        tomorrow at 10:30 a car came and I went in that.   

**Q:**  Where was the meeting?   

**A:**  At his residence. I think it was close
                        by. However, it was a large place and outside I was given a khata nangdzö
                        [Tib. nang mdzod] which was to be given to Chairman Mao. I said, "Okay, and
                        went up. There were people from the Miao nationality. There were many,
                        around 20. So as I went in I gave the khata and he shook hands. They took a
                        lot of photographs. Then we were sitting in order. Next to Mao was a leader,
                        then the Zhuren of the National Women's Association [Tib. rgyal yongs bud
                        med], then me. So they took photographs. After that, he waved his hand in
                        goodbye gesture to the Miao people. I was told to come up. There was the
                        relative of Phünwang Buzhang [Phüntso Wangyal], Thutob [Tib. mthu stobs] or
                        something like that. He said " Lhajam Gusho don't leave". So I went in. The
                        sitting room was rather a small one. At that time Deng Xiaoping was there,
                        then there was another bearded one called Wang Feng or something like that.
                        Then there was the Zhuren of the National Women's Association,the biggest
                        one and myself and Phünwang Buzhang la's relative. 
                        Chairman Mao told me to sit next to him. He was seated like this and he said
                        to sit there. I said no and sat lower down. Then he said to have a
                        cigarette. I said I don't smoke. Then he lit one up. He asked me how I came?
                        I said I came by car via the northern route through Garmu and then took the
                        train. He asked me how the road was. I replied that the road was not
                        completed. There was the Thangula Pass, or whatever it is called, and they
                        were in the process of constructing it. The weather was cold I added. Then
                        he asked, when you came to Beijing it seems that you went for a tour- so how
                        were things. I said that it was very good. He asked whether in Tibet the
                        Chinese were teasing [Tib. brnyas brko] the women in the Women's
                        Association. I said, no they weren't. Even if they did, whatever the monks
                        said to us, we would not respond [Tib. ya lab slog]. I said that the Tibetan
                        people are very religious and patient. I said that after liberation you have
                        said that the religion and the Dalai Lama's status will remain. So for this
                        I am happy and the people of Tibet are happy. So please do your best to
                        continue . Then he
                        asked how many women were there . I replied about 200 since Lhasa was not
                        big and so there are not that many as here. So what was your perception of
                        China, he asked. I said,"I have never seen China before so these days, what
                        should I say, it is like the work done by the cadres of Tibet after
                        liberation. The clothes of the men and women are the same". So that's what I
                        said. Then they said to have some Chinese tea [Tib. qing cha]. So I said I
                        will take leave. He said to stay for a while. So I stayed for a while and
                        then left. He came all the way down to accompany me. From his room to the
                        door of the large house. He was shaking my hands and saying "good, good"
                        [Ch. hao hao].  During this time the Dalai Lama was in
                        India for the Buddha Jayanti. A day or two later while I was staying at the
                        hotel, a man came from the Minorities Office or some other office. He asked
                        me to write a letter to Sawangchemmo telling him that he should not stay in a
                        foreign country for very long since there are a lot of American and English
                        imperialist spies. They will make trouble and even put the personal safety
                        of the Dalai Lama in danger. So they said I have to write a letter. I asked
                        where Sawangchemmo was. He said that at this moment they had gone for a
                        pilgrimage and that if I gave the letter to him, then it would get there
                        immediately. So they said that I had to write a letter. Then, I suspected
                        and thought, "I see, the reason they sent me to China was that they thought
                        that Sawangchemmo would definitely stay in India. It was for this reason."   

**Q:**  When you came down to China, Sawangchemmo
                        was in Lhasa, right?   

**A:**  You mean the Dalai Lama?   

**Q:**  The Dalai Lama and company had not left
                        for India by then, right?   

**A:**  When?   

**Q:**  No. You had to go down for health matters
                        of the women's group, right? So, when was this, when the Dalai Lama was
                        going to India [answer not finished]   

**A:**  It was at the time the Dalai Lama was
                        going to India.   

**Q:**  At the time? About how many days?   

**A:**  When the Dalai Lama was scheduled to
                        leave for India in about 3 weeks time, it was then that I went to China.   

**Q:**  I see, that many .   

**A:**  Anyway, when the Dalai Lama was in India,
                        I was in China.   

**Q:**  So did they, [people] like Taring say
                        that you and only you have to go down to China?   

**A:**  You mean others? I was told that the
                        Chinese said that I have to go. Tan Zhuren himself said so, I was told. Tan
                        Zhuren was the main leader of the Women's Association.   

**Q:**  So do you think that you had to go down
                        to China because they thought that Sawangchemmo would stay?   

**A:**  I think so, but this is only my
                        suspicion.   

**Q:**  Yes.   

**A:**  So that's what I thought, because there
                        was no need for me to go, isn't it?   

**Q:**  Yes, specially meeting Mao [answer not
                        finished]   

**A:**  They could have sent anyone. There were
                        so many other educated ones. There was Samling, Tsögo.   

**Q:**  So did you write the letter?   

**A:**  The letter, I said I will sent it myself.   

**Q:**  So what did he say? [Did he say] that
                        that was not okay?   

**A:**  He said you absolutely must [Tib. yin
                        gcig min gcig] send it. Then, the day after the meeting with Mao, it seems
                        that the Dalai Lama was in Gangtok. There was this Chinese interpreter
                        called Li Zhuren [Li Zuomin] who spoke Tibetan. At around 11, he approached
                        Sawangchemmo with the newspaper with photographs and said, "Oh look! Lhajam
                        Gusho has met Chairman Mao and spoke very well. That everything went so well
                        with Chairman Mao and he was so pleased with Lhajam Gusho. That Lhajam Gusho
                        was very lucky indeed."   

**Q:**  So did you not have to write the letter?   

**A:**  Who?   

**Q:**  They said that you had to write a letter
                        to Sawangchemmo. Did you write the letter?   

**A:**  I wrote one asking him to come back soon.   

**Q:**  So you sent that?   

**A:**  He did not receive it. I didn't write
                        anything in detail.   

**Q:**  So later when Sawangchemmo came from
                        Gangtok and [answer not finished]   

**A:**  Because the real situation is what the
                        government wants to do and we insignificant women, what we say,does not
                        matter. So I did not say much just that things were fine.   

**Q:**  Were they not insisting that you send the
                        letter.   

**A:**  No, not that much. They were being
                        appropriate [Tib. spam po] and not paying much attention [Tib. snang
                            med].   

**Q:**  Before that had other women's members met
                        Chairman Mao?   

**A:**  Before that I had not been on any tours.   

**Q:**  No, I mean other members of the Women's
                        Association.   

**A:**  Yes, they went.   

**Q:**  And did they meet Mao Zedong?   

**A:**  No, never. This was the first time. That
                        was stated in the paper. So during this time Sawangchemmo was in India and it
                        was just to show that Chairman Mao was so happy.   

**Q:**  So when Sawangchemmo returned later, what
                        did he say? Did he say he saw it? 
  

**A:**  Yes, he said he saw it and I think he
                        showed it to everyone 
                        saying that Chairman Mao really liked Lhajam Gusho . People thought that
                        I had said all kinds of excessive [Tib. thal cha] and reckless [Tib. gang
                        byung mang byung] things to Chairman Mao. In Lhasa people were saying such
                        things like "Wow! You must have talked with the Chairman Mao very well." I
                        did not say such things. It's what I have already told you.   

**Q:**  Then you came to Lhasa? So from the time
                        that the person asked you to write, then where did you go?   

**A:**  Then they asked me what I wanted to do. I
                        said I didn't want to stay very long. Taking everything into consideration,
                        since I went on tour it had already been more than two months, so I said
                        that I heard that there were some important pilgrimage sites around Beijing
                        and I would like to visit these. For example, the stupa where the Lord
                        Buddhas tooth was kept, and the Tsuglagang of 500 arhats [Tib. dgra bcom
                        lnga brgya] and Yonghe Monastery. So I went to these and many others and
                        then we returned. Yuthok Lhajam Gusho had fervently requested me to bring
                        Sichöla [Tib. sri chod lags] [her son] with me. He was in Beijing at that
                        time. So we were together. Now think about at this, they sent us from
                        Lanzhou by plane. Myself, Sichöla, the Chinese women and my servant-- that's
                        all that there were on the plane.   

**Q:**  You mean the whole plane?   

**A:**  Yes, the whole plane.   

**Q:**  With just 3 persons.   

**A:**  Four of us. So after meeting Mao Zedong,
                        later too they showed how nice they were and they took us all the way to Dam
                        [Tib. 'dam] [the site of the airport]. The plane was a military one.   

**Q:**  So by then, the airfield had moved from
                        Nagchu to Dam?   

**A:**  Yes. There was no airfield at Nagchu.   

**Q:**  Wasn't there one at Namru [Tib. gnam ru]?   

**A:**  It was at Dam. In the plane there was a
                        hostess and they served tea and food.   

**Q:**  Did you enjoy the food?   

**A:**  Yes, it was delicious. Then when we got
                        to Dam we stayed for quite some time. We got to Dam at around 4 and so we
                        stayed till about 7, resting. The pilots had a hotel to stay in. It was so
                        nice. The food and all must be something special for the pilots. There we
                        had a full course meal. We reached Dam at around 3-4 p.m and we stayed there
                        till 7 p.m. Then we went to Lhasa. It took about 3 hours. Then there was a
                        Trekhang estate, what's it called- there was one at Yamda [Tib. yab mda'],
                        called Mami. At about that spot there were people sent [from Surkhang] to
                        receive us. One car and Kungö Rimshi came. Then we went up [to Lhasa].   

**Q:**  When you went from Dam to Lhasa, then
                        what happened?   

**A:**  When I arrived at Lhasa I rested for a
                        few days. Then they asked me to come to the Women's Association office. All
                        the Uyön had gathered. The Standing Committee members were there and so were
                        all the Zhuren and the Uyön. Then they asked to me say what I did when I
                        went to China. So I related all in detail.   

**Q:**  The newspaper regarding your visit must
                        have already been seen at Lhasa, right?   

**A:**  Yes, they had seen it. They said that it
                        was advertised all over Lhasa. They were astounded, saying you have met
                        Chairman Mao and said a lot of things. I said we didn't talk much. Whatever
                        he asked me, I replied.   

**Q:**  So at the meeting you said something.   

**A:**  Yes, I gave a report. I had a good time,
                        went on a tour, everyday I was entertained, went boating even though there
                        were only four of us. At Shanghai, Sambo kungö and others were there. I met
                        my sister Tsade [Tib. tsha sde]. They had come for a tour.   

**Q:**  Did you have any conversation with them.   

**A:**  At that time, I had not met Mao. "Oh, it
                        is amazing that you had the courage to come alone" [They] said. They should
                        have sent at least one other.   

**Q:**  So it was 1956, almost 1957, and so at
                        that time compared to what it was before, did things get worse.   

**A:**  From around 1957 things got worse. The
                        Chinese must be getting suspicious since they were making preparations for
                        war.   

**Q:**  Since the time you went down until when
                        you returned, was it different?   

**A:**  No, not that much, but in front of Drip
                        Tsecholing [Tib. grib tshe mchog gling] a lot of soldiers were coming and
                        there were arms shipments. This was at night. During this time, it seems
                        that in the Kham area the revolt had started, so the Chinese thought that in
                        the ü area the same thing would happen and made a lot of preparations. Then
                        the Tibetans got suspicious.   

**Q:**  In 1954 the Dalai Lama went down and in
                        1955, the Chinese were saying that in the Kham areas the big lamas went and
                        incited the people.   

**A:**  Yes it was said that they said like that.
                        Yes, I have heard it. They said that during a lecture.   

**Q:**  Anyway, whatever, if they were saying
                        such things in 1956 then the situation must have been getting worse. Then
                        from the Kham area, a lot of people must be coming up [to Lhasa].   

**A:**  Yes, seems that a lot of them were coming
                        up. The war had started down there and they fled from there and stayed in
                        Lhasa and started the Chushigandru.   

**Q:**  That sort of started a little later.   

**A:**  Yes, so they became big. They held the
                        whole of the south, in Lhoka.   

**Q:**  Just before that, was there any
                        disturbance in Lhasa causing a situation where the Khambas could not stay in
                        Lhasa. Was there talk that they must be sent down [back to Kham]?   

**A:**  You mean the Chinese?   

**Q:**  Yes.   

**A:**  The Chinese were saying this all the
                        time, but that the [Tibetan] government also wouldn't let them.   

**Q:**  So in Lhasa some said that around Lhasa
                        the Chinese were making preparations, doing target practice. They fortified
                        their houses with sand bags and were getting ready.   

**A:**  This was just before the Dalai Lama
                        returned.   

**Q:**  So before the Dalai Lama returned from
                        India they made bunkers.   

**A:**  The bunkers were always there.   

**Q:**  From earlier on?   

**A:**  Yes, from about a month before he
                        returned.   

**Q:**  No. no. What about 1952,53.   

**A:**  No, not at that time. When Chushigandru
                        went to the south, that's when a lot of bunkers were set up in Lhasa.   

**Q:**  Were the bunkers only around their
                        offices or everywhere.   

**A:**  Around their offices, to protect them.   

**Q:**  Then there were talks that the Tibetan
                        soldiers had a fight with the Chinese soldiers. Have you heard anything like
                        that?   

**A:**  No I haven't.   

**Q:**  That there was some shooting and somebody
                        got shot-- that during Mönlam a man with a bomb was arrested.   

**A:**  Did they say that?   

**Q:**  Yes there was some talk like that.   

**A:**  Must be, I don't know.   

**Q:**  After Sawangchemmo returned  what did he say. For
                        example, what did he say they talked about?   

**A:**  If  stayed in Tibet then the dangerous time
                        had come. The Chinese were increasing. The Chushigandru had revolted. So,
                        that's what he was thinking. It would not be peaceful in Tibet. There were
                        70 government officials, the most trusted ones, and they had a meeting
                            .   

**Q:**  70 officials were selected?   

**A:**  Yes, both lay and monk officials.   

**Q:**  When was this?   

**A:**  In 1958.   

**Q:**  The uprising was in the [question not
                        finished]   

**A:**  It was in 1959.   

**Q:**  I see, so now we have come to 1959?   

**A:**  I think it was around the 1st month of
                        1959. The Dalai Lama left in the 3rd month.   

**Q:**  So 2 months before?   

**A:**  Probably, something like that. So the
                        officials, it is said, made a pledge not to tell anyone. Made a big pledge.
                        At the meeting the main speaker was Sawangchemmo. He said that we have
                        reached a very dangerous point. If we just hang around thinking that things
                        will be alright, then if the Dalai Lama comes under the Chinese it would be
                        just terrible. Tibet will later be gone completely [Tib. rtsa brlag]. So we
                        must take the Dalai Lama abroad. So if we did that, then what do you all
                        think, give me your opinions because that is what I think. He told me that's
                        what he said. I don't know what the others said. I can't tell you. Most said
                        it was a good idea, that the Dalai Lama should leave. That the Dalai Lama
                        should think about it.   

**Q:**  So in the meeting [question not finished]   

**A:**  In the meeting Kungö Tsögo one or two
                        others who worked for the Chinese were there. It was said that they reported
                        about the meeting to the Chinese and the impossibility of Tibetan- Chinese
                        friendly relations. Then Tsögo did not come to the meetings anymore saying
                        that he wished to take leave and he and about 3 kudrak took leave.
                        Sawangchemmo had to go and the Chinese learned about all the discussions.
                        Sawangchemmo was the main person and the Chinese were very angry. So this
                        meeting was going on and then there was another large Chinese meeting. At
                        that meeting, there the Dalai Lama's 2 tutors were present. It is said that
                        the Dalai Lama was invited also, but he didn't go. All the kudrak were
                        there, the youth and the women's [association members] and prominent people
                        from the general public. The Chinese gave lectures, the 2 tutors also and
                        when it was Sawangchemmo's turn to give a lecture, he didn't stay.   

**Q:**  Was this at a Preparatory Committee for
                        the Tibet Autonomous Region meeting?   

**A:**  On the one hand, the Dalai Lama should
                        not stay. This is what Sawangchemmo was saying. On the other hand when they
                             wanted him to give
                        a lecture, then what was he going to say? It is not possible to say
                        anything. He was in great difficulty, wasn't he? So at the Chinese meeting,
                        when the Chinese tell Surkhang Kalön to give a lecture, what is he going to
                        say?   

**Q:**  So when it was his time to speak, he
                        didn't stay?   

**A:**  He didn't speak and he came home.   

**Q:**  During the meeting? So what did he say?   

**A:**  He just got up and left. He didn't say a
                        thing. Without speaking, he came home. He said he didn't stay at the
                        meeting. So the next day and after that they were saying that the Chinese
                        leader Tan Zhuren was furious and at the meeting he banged his fists on the
                        table and said, "That's right, this Surkhang Kalön is like that. This man,
                        up to this day, has not done a single thing to benefit China. Everything, we
                        have noted down, the year, the month ,the day and the hour. So today he did
                        like that, didn't give a lecture and left". It is said that he [Tan Zhuren]
                        said a lot. "This person is the kind of person who should be punished
                        publicly. We will never just let things be. Today is the first warning. Do
                        it 3 times and we will arrest him". In one way it was good since he found
                        some cleverness.  A lot of kudrak came to the house saying
                        that this is very serious and what are you going to do. You should flee.
                        There were many who told him that. Also they said that if he stayed here
                        they will never let him stay nicely.   

**Q:**  Who came to the house to say these
                        things? Was it kudrak and were there any from monasteries, traders?   

**A:**  Some of our khamtsen monks came. Then
                        Janglojen Gung [Tib. lcang lo can gung], Kungö Sambo, then Kujar and many
                        others. Then the kudrak said that all of us officials are going to have a
                        meeting and we will not hand in Sawangchemmo. If something happens to him
                        then we want the same thing to happen to us. We will never give him up. So
                        it is said that they met.   

**Q:**  So they had a meeting?   

**A:**  Yes, they had one, saying that they will
                        not hand in Sawangchemmo. They secretly talked about it and sent the message
                        to the three great monasteries and all.   

**Q:**  Did they have a place that they met or
                        how was it?   

**A:**  They would go from house to house. Most
                        government officials. Sawangchemmo they said is the main person who
                        challenges the Chinese and we will not let him go from our hands.   

**Q:**  Was it yesterday or the day before when
                        we spoke about the meeting of the 70 odd officials at Shöl or some place.
                        Then at another meeting, a Chinese meeting, Sawangchemmo didn't speak and
                        just left. Then after that Tibetans said that they would not hand in
                        Sawangchemmo. So we had reached that point. So at that time the Chinese
                        scolded Sawangchemmo and said they were going to do something. So at that
                        time did they meet?   

**A:**  The Tibetans?   

**Q:**  Yes.   

**A:**  Yes they met and it is said that they
                        were not going to hand him over to the Chinese. A lot of people also came to
                        see us, kudrak came, saying Sawangchemmo be alert since the Chinese are
                        furious. They said that they were going to arrest him.   

**Q:**  Then what happened after that. Was there
                        some meeting of the monasteries or not?   

**A:**  They spoke among themselves and I think
                        they discussed this a lot. However, there was no starting of a widespread
                        group with meetings. The Chinese also said that their scolding of
                        Sawangchemmo had really alarmed the people. A lot of people were feeling
                        unbearable. The monasteries were also sending messages. So it seems that the
                        Chinese heard all this. So they were also suspicious, probably thinking that
                        all of a sudden there may be some unrest. If this happened, all people would
                        rise up and the Chinese had not finished their war preparations so for the
                        time being they may have said that it would be better to cool things down. I
                        think they thought that.  So one day Li Chuzhang [Li
                        Zuomin] came to see Sawangchemmo. He was a Chinese who spoke Tibetan, did
                        interpreting and was also a notable cadre. He asked Sawangchemmo to come to
                        the Military Headquarters [Ch. si ling bu] as Tan [Guansan] Zhuren had
                        requested him to come. Sawangchemmo said, "What is it about?". "Nothing, he
                        wants to talk a little with you". Deep inside I think he wondered what it
                        was about --going to the military headquarters. However, he just went kind
                        of without paying attention [Tib. snang med].   

**Q:**  He didn't say anything?   

**A:**  He took a servant and went.   

**Q:**  Who was the servant?   

**A:**  It was the Drönyer Tsering Pembar [Tib.
                        tshe ring dpal 'bar]. The Chinese leader had come near to the door and said,
                        "Oh, Surkhang Kalön has come." and acted so pleased. He told him to come in
                        and shook hands. They sat in the sitting room and tea and snacks were served
                        Tan Zhuren said, "I had to scold you last time and for that you must have
                        been very angry. So please don't be disappointed with that. If a very close
                        friend is about to fall from the cliff, it is our duty to pull him up. You
                        have made mistakes in your work. You are among the better and more educated
                        Tibetan Government officials, so when you make such mistakes, we feel a
                        great loss. So we have pulled you up as you were about to fall into the
                        abyss. So please don't be angry, [Ch. dui bu qi] he said.   

**Q:**  [Ch. dui bu qi] means?   

**A:**  "I'm sorry." So he continued, "At that
                        time, when it was your turn to speak, you didn't stay. It was one of our big
                        meetings, not just a small one. So that was a big mistake. And at that time
                        I was very angry. However, after thinking it over, we have to be mutually
                        friendly. We just said those things, but we won't do anything like that." So
                        Sawangchemmo must have said, alright, alright. So he said that that was what
                        was said at the Military Headquarters. We were so afraid, thinking that they
                        will not let him return. They would not take him by force, but just ask him
                        to come matter-of-factly. I thought that they would keep him there and not
                        allow him to come home. We were so afraid. Then he came quite soon. It
                        didn't take very long. He said, "Wow! they were saying like that".   

**Q:**  Last time you were saying that Sichöla
                        was in China. At that at was he not going to school in India?   

**A:**  No, he was not. Sichöla, Dündül la [Tib.
                        bdud 'dul lags] and about 15 other kudrak children were at the Nationality
                        Institute [Tib. mi rigs slob grwa] in Beijing. Sichöla was at the school and
                        Dündül la went as part of the football team to China. He went to play
                        football  in China.   

**Q:**  Then in 1956-57 were there any going to
                        school in India.   

**A:**  No, they were all going down to China
                        then. Most of them would not dare to go.   

**Q:**  Last time, when I was talking to my
                        father he said that those who were staying in Darjeeling and Kalimpong were
                        told that it was not good to send children to school in India and that they
                        were trying to have them send them to Tibet. At first they were in school in
                        India and then [question not finished]   

**A:**  Yes, the Chinese said not to leave the
                        children in India and that they should be withdraw [from school]. I think
                        that's what they said. They were withdrawn.   

**Q:**  So at first they were going to school,
                        right?   

**A:**  Yes, there were many. Three from
                        Kapshöba, and then there was Sumdo [Tib. gsum mdo], and quite a few?

                        children. There were many.   

**Q:**  So the Chinese were saying that they have
                        to go back?   

**A:**  They were saying not to sent them there.
                        Schools have been established in Tibet so send them to school in Tibet.
                        There is no need to know the English language, just Tibetan and Chinese is
                        sufficient.   

**Q:**  Who was it, JT-la or Chundenla [Tib. chos
                        ldan lags] or who?   

**A:**  Chundenla was there.   

**Q:**  Then she came up.   

**A:**  Yes.   

**Q:**  I recall something about either Yangjenla
                        [Tib. dbyangs can lags] or somebody who in 1957 [question not finished]   

**A:**  Then the Tsarong girls were there,
                        Tsering Drolmala [Tib. tshe ring sgrol ma lags], Thöndrub Drolmala [Tib. don
                        grub sgrol ma lags], they were there. Then they went back and Namla and
                        others attended the Society School [Tib. spyi tshogs slob grwa].   

**Q:**  Then a lot of us went to school in India
                        again in 1956, 1957. I went to school in 1957.   

**A:**  I see.   

**Q:**  Didn't anyone from your family come down?   

**A:**  JT la and others went in 1957 again.   

**Q:**  In 1957. Did they go to study or did they
                        go at the time the Dalai Lama came to India?   

**A:**  They went when the Dalai Lama went to
                        India and then did not return. Yangjenla and they went after this.   

**Q:**  Yangchen and who?   

**A:**  Chundenla went from India to that side
                            . She went to the
                        Society School for about 3 or 4 years. Then she came to India again.   

**Q:**  What year was that?   

**A:**  That was in 1957 and Yangjen was also
                        sent you know? When the Queen mother of Sikkim returned they were sent with
                        her.   

**Q:**  So were they sent for the purposes of
                        study or was there a feeling that the situation was not good.   

**A:**  The situation was also not so good. The
                        Khamba revolt had begun and they were coming up [to Lhasa]. We thought
                        things wouldn't be good in Lhasa so they were sent. Whatever may be, we
                        thought it was better to send the children to India since it was a free
                        country. Chundenla went as the companion of Yangjen. Surkhang Khenjung was
                        always in India. In 1957 when the Dalai Lama went for the Buddha Jayanti,
                        since then he [Surkhang Khenjung] stayed in India.
