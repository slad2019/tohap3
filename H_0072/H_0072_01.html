<p> Gyentsen Ph&#xFC;ntso was an important pro-Chinese monk official in the 1950s. In
     this interview, he describes how he became a monk official (tsidrung) and then about his
     experiences in Chamdo in 1949-50 when he was on Lhalu&apos;s and then Ngab&#xF6;&apos;s staff and then when
     Chamdo was taken over by the Chinese. He also discusses being sent to Lhasa from Chamdo with a
     letter from Ngab&#xF6; saying the government should start talks, and discusses returning to Chamdo
     and then going with Ngab&#xF6; to Beijing for the 17-Point Agreement talks. Finally, he talks about
     his role in starting the first trial democratic reforms in T&#xF6;lung Dechen Dzong. [Note: TT =

<p><strong>A:</strong>  I don&apos;t know Chinese characters and I [only] knew a
     little bit [of the] Chinese spoken language. I am saying &apos;thank you&apos; according to the modern
     system. Please write your name in Tibetan on your card.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  TT: Are any of your relatives still alive? Were those
     ordinary tsidrung and shabd&#xF6;ba in your [monk official household] related to you?   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  Yes, they were my relatives, but we were separated from
     the household. My own family was a farmer&apos;s household in Phembo Lhundrup [Tib. &apos;phan po lhun
     grub rdzong] Dzong. We were not landlords [Tib. sa bdag]. My family members are still alive. In
     short, you want me to talk about the history from 1951-1959, right?   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  TT: Yes, especially regarding you going to Chamdo as a
     staff [member] of the Doji and [how] later, you went to T&#xF6;lung Dechen Dzong. In between that,
     there was the People&apos;s Association. So if you were in Lhasa, then, we want to ask [you] about
     that also. Now, there are just a few people who actually saw and heard those things.   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  In the past, according to the custom, we talked [would
     say] one thing to [those on the] inside and talked [would say] another [thing to those on the]
     outside. But now, since you told me to say the truth, I will introduce you to whatever I know.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  Thank you, this is my biggest hope.   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  In the old society, at first, I became a monk. Then at
     age 18, I became a kudrak of the local government called a tsidrung.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  What tratsang were you from?   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  Drepung&apos;s Gomang Tratsang.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  What khamtsen?   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  Samlo Khamtsen. Among the kudrak, there were two types;
     the lay officials and the tsidrung. Among the tsidrung, there were two types. One was
     conscripted as a tax from the monastery and trained in the Tse labdra. They were called
     trachag, and they were conscripted when they needed students in the Tse labdra. But I didn&apos;t
     become a Tse labdra [student]. My gegen was a big kudrak in the Tibetan government. He was one
     of the four Trunyichemmo.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  What [was] his name?   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  His name was Ch&#xF6;mpel Thubden.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  Oh! He was very famous and he was called Bumtang,
     right?  </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  Yes. At the time of the 13th Dalai Lama, which was during
     the Guomindang period&#x2014;there were two ways of calling [two names for] the office in Nanjing.
     Some called it the Dalai Administration Department [Tib. ta lai; Ch. ban shi chu]. Some called
     it the Representatives of the Tibetan Government [Tib. sde pa gzhung gi sku tshab don gchod
     khang]. During the Guomindang, my gegen stayed in Nanjing for a long time, and I was the child
     of his younger brother. In this way, I became the tsidrung. According to the custom in the old
     society, if your gegen was powerful, you became a shabd&#xF6; [official] a little bit easier [than
     others]. I was among this category and I didn&apos;t go to the Tselabdra school. I studied a little
     bit at home. In 1947, I went to Chamdo as a staff [member] of Doji Lhalu. The term of the Dome
     Jigyab was three to four years. I was then a tsendr&#xF6;n, which was a position of the fifth rank.
     I stayed in Chamdo for four years. When Lhalu left and Ngab&#xF6; came, he asked me to stay [on] as
     [part of] his staff. He reported to the local government and I was told to stay [on] as a staff
     [member] of Ngab&#xF6;. Then I stayed there. It was after two and a half or three months that Chamdo
     was liberated. At this time, I had no wife or kids. I was a monk official kudrak. I was in
     charge of sending the horse corv&#xE9;es and the people as a corv&#xE9;e tax. This was work like the
     Mayor of Lhasa, that is, the mip&#xF6;n in Lhasa. In Chamdo, there was [something] like a mip&#xF6;n who
     was the person in-charge of the horse corv&#xE9;e tax and the head of the misers. My lay official
     colleague was Th&#xF6;npasey [Tib. thon pa sras]. When Chamdo was liberated, I was
     in Chamdo, and Ngab&#xF6; and the other lay and monk officials of the fourth rank and the fifth rank
     were also there. Probably on the 18th of the 10th Tibetan month, before dawn, we the staff
     [members] and Ngab&#xF6; fled together from Chamdo because Chamdo was liberated and the situation
     was tense. But, on the evening of the 17th, Ngab&#xF6; called a meeting of all the kudrak regardless
     of their ranks and he said, &quot;Chamdo is [about to be] liberated and Derge [Tib. sde dge], Jomda
     [Tib. &apos;jo mda&apos;], Denma [Tib. ldan ma], Markham [Tib. smar khams] [and] the areas on both sides
     of the Yangtse River are lost. We [have] received emergency petitions from those places. So
     given this, what do you suggest we do? All of the kudrak should think about this.&quot; Although it
     was in the old society, Ngab&#xF6; was more knowledgeable than us and he knew clearly that we didn&apos;t
     have the strength to make war. Anyway, we held a lot of discussions on what to do.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  How many lay and monk officials were there at the
     meeting?   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  There were about 25 kudraks at the meeting who were
     staying in Chamdo. All the kudrak, including myself&#x2014;everyone had doubts about the Communists,
     and were apprehensive. At that time, there was a lot of talk. You professor, my friend who came
     from America&#x2014;but at that time, there were rumors made by the imperialists and we listened to
     them many times. So no one had any thoughts of making relations with the Chinese. The only
     thought was to flee.  At this time, Ngab&#xF6;&apos;s thought was that making war was
     useless and it would be better to hold talks with the Chinese, but since he was the Doji, it
     was probably not convenient for him to say that. So he just said, &quot;Then, then, then.&quot;
     [Laughter] Finally, everybody said we will flee [answer not finished]   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  Were there some people who had the thought of making war?   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  At first, there was the thought of making war because, at
     that time, there was the guard troops [Tib. sa srung dmag mi] and the Gadang Regiment, and the
     third (Shigatse) regiment which had 1,000 troops.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  Where was the Gadang Regiment from?   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  There were only 1,000 troops and two dep&#xF6;n. Muja [Tib. mu
     bya] Dep&#xF6;n was at Denma to stop the People&apos;s Liberation Army that was coming from there. The
     other dep&#xF6;n, Karchungwa [Tib. dkar byung ba], was at Jomda. Each had 500 troops. But really,
     they had less than 500. Since they got the money substitute for some soldiers [not serving], it
     was okay even [if] the soldiers were not there&#x2014;but they got the salary of 500 [soldiers]. The
     Tadang Regiment, the ninth regiment, was at Markham. The dep&#xF6;n was Derge Sey [Tib. sde dge
     sras]. At this time, there were some powerful lamas, like Gongkar Lamatsang [Tib. gong dkar bla
     ma tshang] and [lay leaders like] Panda Tobgye [Tib. spom mda&apos; stobs rgyas]. They were very
     powerful families in the past. At this time, the Guomindang soldiers, though they were only a
     small number, would get very scared of Panda Tobgye who was staying at the Tshakhalo [Tib.
     tshwa kha lho] then. When I was there, all the people, including myself, called the Communists
     &quot;gungtren&quot; [Ch. gong chan]. And there was no talk about the Communist Party. At this time,
     Tshakhalo Monastery reported to the Doji that when Dartsedo was liberated by the People&apos;s
     Liberation Army, there were probably one to four regiments of the Guomindang which had fled
     upwards [toward Tibet]. They requested that the Doji give them guns and ammunition. So he
     (Lhalu) sent them 50 305 British Carbines and 20 or 30 boxes of ammunition. I don&apos;t remember
     the exact number. Then Derge Sey surrendered. The gadrung in Chamdo was Ts&#xF6;go [Tib. mtsho sgo].
     Now, from the PRC point of view, what Derge Sey did was just called a revolt [Ch. qi yi; Tib.
     &apos;os langs]. So they didn&apos;t have time to fight. We received a petition after the Tadang Dep&#xF6;n
     revolted about a desperate situation. The petition said, &quot;Some well-alarmed Guomindang troops
     with their leaders were advancing towards Tog where the Tog Magp&#xF6;n [Tib. tog dmag dpon] was.
     This is the place where there used to be a salt tax collector&#x2014;and they are also going through
     Dzayul [Tib. rda yul] and they are asking for permission to go through Dzayul to India. Or they
     are going to come to Tibet.&quot; I heard that they had gold biscuits strapped on their calves
     [under their] leggings. So at that time, Ngab&#xF6; contacted Lhasa and reported what the Guomindang
     said above. The answer from here was to not let them go to Lhasa and that it would not be
     alright to send them through Dzayul indiscriminately. The wording was, &quot;it is not alright,&quot; was
     just pleasant sounding words, but to not let them come up was the real talk. So those soldiers
     fled to India through Dzayul.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  How many soldiers were there?   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  [Another person speaking] Wasn&apos;t that the troop of Can
     Zhingtai?   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  Oh! Yes, that&apos;s right. They had about 200 troops and they
     were probably tough, but since the People&apos;s Liberation Army outnumbered their troops, they had
     to flee. They also propagandized a lot as they fled, telling the Tibetans that there would be
     no happiness under the Communists. [That] they would probably eliminate all of the chiefs [Tib.
     dpon po], the religion and also old people. I didn&apos;t see them, but I knew that the report
     arrived.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  While Lhalu was the doji, I heard Nangchen Gyalpo [Tib.
     nang chen rgyal po] and Lhalu sent letters to each other and they discussed both of their
     armies joining together and fighting the People&apos;s Liberation Army. Is this true?   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  Yes. It is true. At that time, the chief of Nangchen told
     Lhalu, &quot;Now, the Communists are not familiar with the places of Tibet. So if we can have
     solidarity and start a war, this would be much better [than acting independently later]. If we
     cannot do this, we won&apos;t have any method [to act] in the future.&quot; This is a true fact, whether
     we said it or Lhalu said it. Even in the history book written by Shakabpa, he wrote about this.
     Now, we shouldn&apos;t tell lies to the Communists.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  Was Nangchen Gyalpo alone or were there other chiefs with
     him?   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  Nangchen Gyalpo, himself, probably didn&apos;t say that. There
     were several chiefs [Tib. dpon khag] and it was said by one of the chiefs.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  When was that? Was it in 1950?   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  It was around the 12th Tibetan month of 1949. At this
     time, Ngab&#xF6; hadn&apos;t arrived in Chamdo. Lhalu sent a report to the government and there was an
     answer to this. According to the old society&apos;s custom, they did the senriy (divine lottery),
     which said it would be good. So the Kashag sent an answer saying, &quot;If you can attack and hold
     [on to] the territory, it will be good [Tib. phar rgol byas nas sa srung thub pa dang/ de
     &apos;dra&apos;i gnas tshul yin na yag po &apos;dug].&quot; At this time, the Chadang Regiment was sent from Lhasa
     with cannons and mules to haul them and the artillery troops to fire them, and they arrived in
     Chamdo. But then when it was confirmed that the new doji was Ngab&#xF6;, Lhalu heard about this. So
     he thought that if he were to attack [the Chinese], then it would cause trouble [Tib. skyo mo
     g.yos] when Ngab&#xF6; came and he handed over the doji [to him]. And [so] he stopped doing that and
     didn&apos;t attack. This is exactly what happened. Then Ngab&#xF6; arrived during the third Tibetan
     month. Lhalu stayed for about 20 or so days and then left. At this time, the regent was Taktra
     and the Dalai Lama didn&apos;t have power [over government affairs], and the Kal&#xF6;ns were Surkhang,
     Ramba Kal&#xF6;n Lama, Ngab&#xF6;, and Ragashag. At that time, the Kashag&apos;s order for Lhalu was to stay
     with Ngab&#xF6; since it was an emergency, but Lhalu left saying that since the new doji came, he
     was going to ask for leave.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  TT: He didn&apos;t adhere to the order, right?   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  Yes, he might have used some methods around here. When
     Lhalu left, the government learned of it and told him to stay in Lharigo and to not come up (to
     Lhasa) right away.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  I heard in India that as soon as Ngab&#xF6; arrived&#x2014;Ngab&#xF6; and
     Lhalu had different thoughts because Ngab&#xF6; was thinking it would be useless to fight and Lhalu
     was a little bit enthusiastic to make war. Is that true?   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  This is likely [Tib. &apos;dra po red] [true] because they
     were the old and new Doji Kal&#xF6;n, but their mental strategies were different. Ngab&#xF6; was thinking
     that it was useless to make war and thought of holding peaceful negotiations. As for Lhalu, for
     example, he had talks with Nangchen, as I mentioned above.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  I heard this from some people, but I am not clear [about
     this]. Do you know about Panda Tobgye [Tib. stobs rgyas] and or Raga [Tib. rab dga&apos;] coming to
     Chamdo to negotiate?   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  It was Raga.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  I heard that outwardly, Panda was sent by the Chinese and
     came to hold peace talks, but internally, they told the Tibetan government that the Khambas
     would help the Tibetan government to oppose the Chinese and that in the future, the government
     should give the Khambas some authority. Was that true?   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  I will explain this [to you]. I was there and I know
     about this. At this time, the CCP hadn&apos;t [yet] crossed the Yangtse River in Derge, but at
     Denma, the fighting had started, and we received petitions saying that the Communists were
     coming and that the war had started at Denma and the other side of the Yangtse River had almost
     been taken [by the Chinese]. Ngab&#xF6; had no idea of fighting and wanted peaceful negotiations.
     Before the People&apos;s Liberation Army arrived in Chamdo, Panda Raga was in Chamdo. I didn&apos;t know
     what other work he was doing. He was doing a little bit of trade with guns and satin. Since he
     was famous, Ngab&#xF6; sent Raga and the fifth rank tsidrung, Riwoche Lanyrer [Tib. bla gnyer] Yeshe
     Targye [Tib. ye shes dar rgyas] to Markham to meet the Chinese because at that time
     ,
     the 52nd Division of the People&apos;s Liberation Army had arrived there with Political Commissioner
     [Ch. zheng wei] Zhang Xiaomin. I forget the name of the regimental commander who used to work
     in the Civil Administration Bureau. [Another person talking] He was called Cai something. They
     were sent by Ngab&#xF6; and the local government did not tell them to go. They were sent to tell the
     Chinese, &quot;Please, hold the soldiers there and do not come over [to Tibetan territory]. We are
     going to negotiate.&quot; The fifth rank tsidrung in Chamdo who was called Phagpa Lengden [Tib.
     &apos;pags pa legs ldan] was sent to Denma to tell the People&apos;s Liberation Army not to come over.
     &quot;We are going to hold peace talks.&quot; When those people were sent, the Chinese kept on attacking.
     Abo Raga could get in touch with the 52nd Division, but Phagpa Lengden didn&apos;t get the chance to
     get in touch with the Chinese in Denma because the Chinese kept on making war. The reason why
     they sent Yeshe Targye was because he knew the Chinese language well [from] when he stayed in
     China with his gegen, Yingon [Tib. dbyings mgon] Dzasa.  We all fled early in
     the morning of the 18th. On the 19th, the People&apos;s Liberation Army arrived in Chamdo. We all
     left on horseback. On the way to Lhasa, there is a high mountain pass called Namtsola [Tib.
     gnam mtsho la]. The pass is all dense forest where you cannot see a person if they go a little
     further [ahead]. It takes two days to get there by horseback from Chamdo. We all left together
     but when we reached the pass, we weren&apos;t all together since some horses were better than others
     and reached there faster, and people went in different groups. At that time, we didn&apos;t think of
     any of our wealth and we were just trying to save our lives. I was riding with Maya Tsewang
     [Tib. rma bya tshe dbang], who is now in India. We were very close friends. He was much more
     clever than me and I was more stupid.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  I don&apos;t think so.   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  It was really like this, and British Ford was with us. I
     was friendly with him. We both had no wives, so on Saturdays, we would drink chang. And I would
     go with him on horseback hunting rabbits, though it was not allowed, and we also went bathing
     [together], et cetera. Ford knew about world affairs, and he might have heard a lot of things,
     but we didn&apos;t hear about those things. Ford was telling me, &quot;Now, you should be careful.&quot; He
     had a movie camera. He said, &quot;When the Communists come, I will shoot a movie and leave. You and
     Tsewang should also come with me to England and live with me.&quot; He said that he had a mother or
     a father.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  He meant that you should flee with him, right?   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  Yes, I thought it was about the two paths. One was to go
     to one&apos;s own homeland, Lhasa, and the other was to go to England with Ford because he didn&apos;t
     have the thought to stay in Lhasa. So I was wondering what to do. Didn&apos;t I tell you that Maya
     was more clever than me? Maya then said, &quot;We shouldn&apos;t do this. The governor of Chamdo, the
     Doji is Ngab&#xF6;. Nowadays, through all the broadcasts, they are talking about the British
     imperialists. So if we go with them, it will be a great mistake [Tib. dpe bsags kyi red]
     because one is the wireless operator of the British imperialists and the other is the Doji.
     There is a no other choice but to surrender.&quot; He was right. This was the talk at the critical
     point. So according to the Khamba custom, we swore like this [probably hooking their fingers]
     not to join either of these two and [decided to] go back [to Chamdo]. But Ford was with us and
     he was not going ahead. I had a nyerpa (steward) then who used to be the servant of Yadong
     Geshe Rimpoche. At that time, the two of us pretended to urinate and I told my nyerpa to take
     Ford and go ahead, and then I gave my nyerpa a secret eye signal to return back after taking
     Ford, and then I swear by the Three Jewels that the two of us returned to Chamdo to surrender.
     But, we didn&apos;t go directly to Chamdo. There was a very big agro-pastoral household called
     Sagong who was the Dr&#xF6;nyerchemmo of Chamdo Phagpalha [Tib. &apos;phags pa lha]. So on the first
     night of the 19th, we came back and stayed in their nomads&apos; place, which was at a high altitude
     on the mountain. And it was also snowing. The next morning, at dawn, about 5-6 a.m., somebody
     was knocking on the door a lot. I told my servant to have a look and we saw that seven People&apos;s
     Liberation Army troops had arrived. [Laughter] The translator was a Muslim in Chamdo called
     Chabgya [Tib. chab rgya] [which means Chamdo in Chinese]. He was the grandson of one of the
     Chinese troops called Lujun who came to Lhasa in 1910. At that time, it was a little bit scary.
     The miser probably told them and they said, &quot;We heard that the two of you had come here, but
     you don&apos;t need to be scared. Chamdo has been militarily liberated. If you have guns or horses,
     turn them over to us. Whether you have them or not, if you have gold or silver, you can ask
     whoever you want to keep them. We don&apos;t want them.&quot; The military officer was a Regimental
     Commander [Ch. tuan zhang]. I forget his name. At that time, the People&apos;s Liberation Army
     regiment was near the bridge called Kuru Samba [Tib. gu ru zam pa], and the People&apos;s Liberation
     Army had a very hard time. They didn&apos;t have much food to eat. They would buy some barley from
     the miser and boil it in their mugs and eat it. They had abundant firewood. When they boiled
     the barley, the barley was mixed with reddish earth. They just boiled it and it was like this.
     Then they called us and took us downhill [on the] road. They were taking good care of us and
     shone a torch on the way. But I thought, &quot;Now they are just duping us. Anyway, they will
     definitely kill us.&quot; [Laughter] Even when he jumped some small trenches, the People&apos;s
     Liberation Army was holding our hands like this, but we had no belief in the People&apos;s
     Liberation Army at all. To tell you the truth, I didn&apos;t trust them. When we
     reached Kuru Samba, we saw that the place was filled with the regiment, and we were taken to
     the Tuanzhang and he gave us some Chinese tea. We had already turned over our horses and guns.
     I was a 5th rank [official] and Maya was an ordinary official [Tib. dkyus ma], and he was
     sitting at the end of the row. The Tuanzhang said, &quot;You don&apos;t have to be afraid.&quot; And he told
     us the CCP&apos;s policies. Then he said, &quot;Tonight, let&apos;s sleep together.&quot; And we slept in the
     middle and the soldiers slept around us. The soldiers probably got cold and they made a bonfire
     with straw and were sitting by the fire. At this time, the Tibetan government had recruited
     militia from Shotalhosum (Shopando [Tib. sho pa mdo], Pembar [Tib. dpal &apos;bar] and Lhodzong
     [Tib. lho rdzong]), and lay and monk officials were appointed as the dep&#xF6;ns.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  Who appointed the dep&#xF6;n? Was it Lhalu or Ngab&#xF6;? Ngab&#xF6;
     appointed them, but he had to report to the local government. At that time, the government gave
     permission to recruit the militias. In the Denma area, many of the militia had already been
     arrested [laughter]. In the morning, we saw that many militia men had been arrested and that
     they were staying there together, and the People&apos;s Liberation Army was about to take them to
     Chamdo. So they told Maya to go to Chamdo with the soldiers who were going to take the militia,
     and they told me, &quot;You should stay with us. We will give you food and beverages, and there will
     be no danger to your life.&quot; At that time, Ngab&#xF6;, and kudrak like the Dep&#xF6;n and Ford, had run
     away to Drugu [Tib. gru gu dgon] Monastery. As I mentioned above, I had been the official in
     charge of the horse and pack animals&apos; corv&#xE9;e. The Chinese might had heard this from the miser.
     Then the Chinese told me, &quot;You should stay here. The People&apos;s Liberation Army has problems with
     [getting] food. So you should help us buy some barley, goats, and meat.&quot; Since I was in charge
     of the miser, I knew the people [local officials} like the gembo and the dingp&#xF6;n. So I went to
     the misers and I told them that the Chinese wanted them to sell some tsamba and a few of their
     goats. At that time, to tell you the truth, in Chamdo, the livelihood of the masses was poor.
     The miser said, &quot;We really don&apos;t have tsamba, but since you, the tsendr&#xF6;n in charge of the
     horse corv&#xE9;e [Tib. rta spyi rtse mgron] asked us, tonight we will sell you whatever amount of
     goats you want.&quot; So that night, I told the Chinese, that it was difficult to get tsamba but
     that they said they would support whatever amount of goats they needed. They said okay and I
     bought the goats and paid in dayan. Although the people as a whole might have had that
     [compassion], the majority didn&apos;t have that. If you are not capable, there is nobody to beg or
     to give you something. The Tibetan people have a characteristic sense of compassion. So in
     Tibet, if you don&apos;t feel ashamed and if you say, &quot;please&quot;, you will never be left hungry. This
     is probably the character of the nationality. So they sold the goats to the People&apos;s Liberation
     Army out of this.  Then Ngab&#xF6; and Khenche Dawala [Tib. khan che zla ba lags],
     the fourth rank official, Ford, and the rest, were returned to Chamdo. The troops who received
     the surrender of Ngab&#xF6; and the officials were the cavalry from Qinghai led by Fan Ming&apos;s
     troops. They had come from the north through Riwoche. They came from Riwoche through Lagong
     Ngamda and reached Drugu Monastery here. The ones who took the whole area of Chamdo were the
     18th Corps troops [from Sichuan]. So they had a little bit [of an] argument.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  What was the argument about?   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  The 18th Corps said they liberated Chamdo and Fan Ming&apos;s
     Cavalry said they captured the Doji. This argument went on for half a day, although all the
     soldiers wouldn&apos;t do anything reckless, the heads were talking to each other. Later, I heard
     that they petitioned the Central Committee about this. I was not there when they petitioned
     [answer not finished] .   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  Tashi T: Who was the leader of the 18th Corps?   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  Wang Qimei was the one who came first, and the Corps
     Commander [Ch. jun zhang] was Zhang Guohua.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  I heard from Ford when I met him in England&#x2014;and he is
     healthy&#x2014;he said Muja Dep&#xF6;n didn&apos;t dismantle his soldiers and they were kind of together when he
     went with Ngab&#xF6;. When they reached the pass, they thought that the People&apos;s Liberation Army had
     reached Lagong Ngamda and Muja told Ford, &quot;There is no problem because there are probably not
     that many people [Chinese]. So if we make a little bit of war on the pass, we can get through
     it.&quot; Then Muja asked Ngab&#xF6; but Ngab&#xF6; didn&apos;t give the order. Is that true?   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  There is a little contradiction in this talk. When Ngab&#xF6;
     fled, he only had a few Trapchi soldiers with him, not Muja Dep&#xF6;n&apos;s Gadang Regiment. Normally,
     the Trapchi Regiment was in Lhasa and it was up to the choice of the Doji whichever regiment he
     wanted to take. So he took 100 Trapchi soldiers.
      Then Ngab&#xF6;
     came to Chamdo on the 21st or 22nd with Fan Ming&apos;s cavalry. Ngab&#xF6; stayed in Chamdo and the
     cavalry returned to Jyekundo [Tib. skye rgu mdo] after a day in Chamdo
     . They probably left because the soldiers that
     had taken Chamdo were the 18th Corps.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  Was Fan Ming the leader of the cavalry then?   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  Fan Ming came later, but I heard that the cavalry
     belonged to his army in Qinghai. At the time, when they brought Ngab&#xF6; and when we surrendered,
     the People&apos;s Liberation Army was following the Three Main Rules of Discipline and the Eight
     Points of Attention [Tib. sgrig khrims chen po gsum dang do snang byed dgos pa brgyad] laid
     [out] by Chairman Mao, and so the soldiers were not allowed to go to the misers&apos; houses. I have
     a photo of Chairman Mao and I have great love, respect, and loyalty towards him. The soldiers
     were not allowed to beat and scold people. Now I have a great belief that these rules are great
     and glorious because the Chinese revolution was done by Chairman Mao. When we arrived in
     Chamdo, Ngab&#xF6; and most of the kudrak were kept together. If you look at it all of a sudden, it
     was called kind of [something like a] prison? But, how they introduced me to it was [they
     said], &quot;This is not a prison. It is a study session [Tib. slob sbyong].&quot; All of the others who
     ran away were arrested, but they didn&apos;t arrest me because I had surrendered at Kuru Samba.
     Later, an interpreter came with Director Liu Zhuren who used to be one of the officials of the
     Rear Service [Ch. hou qing] of the Tibetan military headquarters. [He] had come to Chamdo as
     the official in the Front Line Headquarters [Ch. qian xian zhi hui bu]. I surrendered to him,
     and the misers might have told him about me being the in-charge of the misers for the horse and
     pack animals corv&#xE9;e tax, so I was not among the detainees. At that time, the kudrak led by
     Ngab&#xF6; were detained in the rooms in groups of 8-10, but they were not kept strictly. At that
     time, there was the Division Commander, Wu Shizhang. I went to see him carrying a khata
     according to Tibetan custom, and my bedding, and [I] told him through the translator, &quot;Ngab&#xF6;
     and all of the government kudrak and the dep&#xF6;n are detained there. Please, may I stay with
     them?&quot; Wu Shizhang burst into laughter. [Laughter] One of the interpreters was Kesang Yanga
     [Tib. skal bzang dbyang dga&apos;]. Another interpreter was also called Kesang; he became the
     Chairman of the Political Consultative Conference. He used to be the servant of Ph&#xFC;nkhang
     Jedrungla [Tib. phun khang rje drung la]. Later, he went to China and became the highest
     interpreter to Wu Shizhang.  Wu Shizhang said, &quot;It is a study session, not a
     detaining place. If you want to go there, you can go and stay with them. You can also come
     here,&quot; and [he] gave me a letter. At this time, we bought barley from Phagpalha [Tib. &apos;phags pa
     lha] Labrang and Shiwala [Tib. zhi ba lha] Labrang, and I was told to work on the horse corv&#xE9;e,
     pack animal [corv&#xE9;e] and grinding tsamba for the People&apos;s Liberation Army. At that time, it was
     kind of scary, so I said yes. The People&apos;s Liberation Army was paying dayan for the barley, and
     the Chinese Section Leader, Dai Kezhang, who later worked in the firewood office [Ch. ran liao
     gong si], was assigned as my partner. He paid the money, and I was to mill it into tsamba.
     Although the miser were paid, at that time, they didn&apos;t have the mental understanding. So they
     didn&apos;t come no matter how many times they were called [laughter]. So the People&apos;s Liberation
     Army told me to take charge of the tsamba milling and hiring the pack animals, and I said yes.
     Then they told me to do the things as I did them in the old society. So I sent a written order
     to the miser like I did in the past, and the wording was as follows: &quot;Listen! Yesterday, the
     Communists told you to send the pack animals and that they will pay for them, but you didn&apos;t
     show up. Now, if you don&apos;t send the pack animals to Chamdo when the sun shines on the Bengo
     mountain, it will be too late and we will have to punish you. This order is from the Tsendr&#xF6;n
     in charge of the horse corv&#xE9;e [Tib. tho don/ kha sa gung pran gyis khe ma gtong rogs/ dngul
     sprod kyi yin zer yang btang mi &apos;dug pa da cha sang nyin sbe &apos;go rir nyi ma rste shar la khe ma
     rnams ma &apos;byor na bkod pa shod dgos byung na phyis pa red/ rta spyi rtse mgron nas].&quot; I put my
     seal on it. On the next day, it was after sunrise, but the animals arrived there at noon. There
     were so many pack animals [that] arrived in Chamdo [laughter].  At that time,
     I milled the tsamba in that way and now we can say that I served the people. But, at that time,
     I didn&apos;t have the idea of serving the people. It was kind of not alright if I didn&apos;t do what I
     was told to do. Now I think that what I did at that time was right.  Then
     after about 7-8 days, Ngab&#xF6; and the advanced troops of the 18th Corps led by Political
     Commissioner [Tib. chab srid; Ch. wei yuan] Wang Qimei had a discussion saying that it was best
     to have talks for the peaceful liberation, and Ngab&#xF6; agreed. At this time, the first People&apos;s
     Liberation Army troops had reached Lhodzong. Ngab&#xF6; said, &quot;For the time being, the troops should
     stay there and not come up. I will send up a report.&quot; So Wang Qimei said, &quot;That&apos;s a good idea,
     and you should send the report to the Kashag and the Dalai Lama, and you should think about
     sending the report through a person who will go up and come back.&quot; About eight days later I got
     a message to come see Ngab&#xF6;. He said, &quot;You and Samling [Tib. bsam gling] Gandr&#xF6;n should go
     tomorrow or the day after. Chamdo is liberated, but the People&apos;s Liberation Army will remain in
     Lhodzong and won&apos;t go to Lhasa. So the two of you should go deliver the report. Can you do
     this?&quot; I said, &quot;Certainly!&quot; Then he asked me what difficulties I had. &quot;As for my difficulties,
     I can&apos;t walk. And normally, we would have the travel document, the lamyig, and we could say
     that we wanted the horses and the pack animals. But now, in case we can&apos;t get that, what shall
     we do?&quot; I had a little bit of money. I didn&apos;t have much money since I was a monk and I didn&apos;t
     do any trading. Ngab&#xF6; and Wang Qimei gave us some money for the road, and Wang Qimei gave me a
     pistol for security. At that time, Wang Qimei had an interpreter who was from Ba and who later
     died when his gun went off accidentally. Wang told him to give his pistol to me. At that time,
     we had to be careful both inside and outside. Most of the places sent us the horse corv&#xE9;e
     because we had the lamyig document. Some wouldn&apos;t send anything [though]. When we left Shopando
     and reached the place called Ogyen Tamda, there they didn&apos;t send the horse corv&#xE9;e so we had to
     carry the saddles on our backs and carry the rifles we had, and cross the pass on foot. And
     [then we] arrived at the Ng&#xF6;drukha. There the miser also didn&apos;t send any horse corv&#xE9;es. When we
     asked them why, they said, &quot;Now we have been liberated, so we won&apos;t dare send the horse
     corv&#xE9;e.&quot; So we bought three to four horses since we had the hundred sang notes of Tibetan
     currency. The horses were cheap, like 100-125 sang. I came seven days and nights on horseback
     and I felt so sleepy that I fell down from the horse&apos;s back, but we were kind of scared because
     [we] had the report to be delivered to the Dalai Lama. Two horses died on the way. When we came
     up, Lhalu was at Lharigo, and we also had a report to [give to] Lhalu. He asked how things were
     in Chamdo, so I told him what I knew. In Lharigo, there was a severe internal contradiction.
     Lhalu had his own bodyguards were there and there was also the Drongdrag Magar there, which had
     once been set up during the 13th Dalai Lama&apos;s time, but had been the dismantled. Then for
     attacking Chamdo, the Drongdrag Regiment was newly set up and the dep&#xF6;n was Kharna [Tib. mkhar
     sna], and there were also some monk soldiers [Tib. ser dmag] from the Three Great Monasteries
     [which] consisted of the chandz&#xF6; and dobdo. I stayed [for] two hours at Lhalu&apos;s. From Lharigo,
     Lhalu sent a telegraph to Lhasa saying that we had come from Chamdo to deliver the report.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  Did you see the content of the report you were carrying?   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  At that time, we didn&apos;t have time to talk about that
     much. Before that, during the Taktra [recency], they broadcasted many times that we were going
     to make war even if the men were exhausted and only women [were] left. So it was written in the
     letter, &quot;Chamdo is liberated and there is no way to have an armed battle. So you should think
     about this carefully. If we hold peace talks, it would be beneficial for the Tibetan people not
     to have to suffer. I am at Chamdo, the Chinese captured me. The local government should try to
     hold the talks and if you have hope to hold the talks, please send a delegation.&quot; When the two of us were coming from Tsomora riding our horses, we met an adrung
     messenger coming from Lhasa riding a horse with bells hung on it. He dismounted at once and
     took off his hat and said, &quot;Kung&#xF6;, congratulations [Tib. bkra shis bde legs]!&quot; When I asked him
     where he was going, he said that he was told to go receive us. Then he gave us a written notice
     saying, &quot;We know that you have come to deliver the report. So don&apos;t go to your homes and come
     directly to the Kashag. You don&apos;t have to change your clothes.&quot; So we dismounted our horses at
     the dharma teaching area called the Sungj&#xF6;rawa [at the Tsuglakhang], and immediately went to
     the Kashag, which was meeting in the Jokhang. When we dismounted our horses, there were a lot
     of people there waiting to see us. Some said, &quot;Poor things! They came from such a long
     distance.&quot; Some scolded us saying, &quot;You are the losers [Tib. bskyal mgo ril].&quot;   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  What did they mean by the loser?   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  They meant that we lost Chamdo. This was a struggle
     between the two viewpoints. So I didn&apos;t get angry when they said that, and it was also useless
     to be angry because this was the struggle between inside and outside. So we went to meet the
     Kashag. There was Ramba, Surkhang, and Thubden Ramyang [Tib. thub bstan rab dbyangs]. Usually,
     you couldn&apos;t just go in indiscriminately.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  TT: Especially the ordinary lay and monk officials
     couldn&apos;t go in.   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  Yes, usually, there would be a cushion down there or we
     [would] have to bend our body, but this time they [just] told us to come in. It was really like
     a guest and the host [laughter]. We gave them the report and told the [Kashag] about the
     matter. Then they had tea prepared and served us tea. Surkhang was very tactful and said, &quot;Oh!
     You can have the tea in my cup.&quot; Then we drank the tea. We were not allowed to go to the Dalai
     Lama without going through the Kashag. We gave the report and explained the entire situation
     and events of Chamdo. The Kashag said, &quot;You have gone through severe difficulties and it is
     great that you have arrived.&quot; In the Kashag, there were two types of people. Those who were
     stubborn and those who were not that stubborn. Ramba said, &quot;Oh my, how did we come to this
     state? [It&apos;s] like the other side is like iron and we are like bag [Tib. spags] (kneaded
     dough). We didn&apos;t get any time to do anything, right?&quot; [Laughter]
     . We didn&apos;t answer him
     but just said, &quot;Yes, yes.&quot; Surkhang was tactful and said, &quot;Oh! You have had a hard time, it&apos;s
     not your fault. It&apos;s good that Ngab&#xF6; and his staff are all alright. For the time being, we
     don&apos;t have anything to do. We should think about what to do in the future. You two take it easy
     and rest up for a few days.&quot; The two gadrung were Dumra [Tib. ldum ra] and Malamba [Tib. rmar
     lam pa]. They brought us tea leaves and butter from the Kashag and we stayed at home. We
     arrived in 1950 on the 11th month, the 6th day.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  TT: This was in 1951, right?   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  No. It was in 1950. At that time, there were a lot of
     meetings in the Potala. The Dalai Lama was almost 18.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  TT: At that time, he hadn&apos;t taken [over] the political
     and religious power, right?   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  Taktra had resigned and according to tradition, he should
     be 18 years old [to take over]. But when he was almost 18, he had to take the political and
     religious power. So a tsondu hragdu gyepa was called where the representatives of the
     government officials, the abbots of the Three Great Monasteries, and the dep&#xF6;ns attended. I
     heard that they held a discussion on the Chamdo situation. Some said, &quot;We are determined.&quot; In
     short, they were saying that they were still going to fight. They said, &quot;There is nothing to
     surrender to the Communists and it is useless to talk.&quot; But, the majority said, &quot;Ngab&#xF6; has
     reported to the Kashag and the Dalai Lama, and the meeting was told to discuss this. In
     accordance with this, we should proceed with the negotiations. So we should send people and
     hold talks for the peaceful liberation.&quot; At that time, the minority had to yield to the
     majority, and it was confirmed to hold the talks.  On the 7th, they appointed
     Lukhangwa and Lobsang Tashi as Sitsab. The Dalai Lama was probably about to leave, but we
     didn&apos;t know that. And on the 11th, early [in the] morning, Samling came to my house. He said,
     &quot;Old man! Aren&apos;t you going to get up?&quot; I said, &quot;Why should I get up? I have no work.&quot; He said,
     &quot;It is finished [Tib. dpe bsags bzhag]!&quot; &quot;What happened?&quot; I asked, and he said, &quot;This morning,
     the Dalai Lama left the Potala.&quot; I asked, &quot;Where did he go?&quot; He said, &quot;I don&apos;t know where.&quot; So
     he left on the 11th of the 11th month and [he] knew how he left. He said that the Dalai Lama
     was dressed in a chupa and rode a horse, and he left from the back of the Potala.  On the 11th, I got a message saying that I and Samling should come to the
     Kashag at 4 p.m. At this time, there was Shasur and Thubden Ramyang.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  TT: They were the gatsab, right?   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  Yes, there were only two of them and they told us, &quot;For
     the time being, the Dalai Lama has gone to Yadong to avoid danger and now the Sitsab are in
     charge of the political power, and two of us were handed the responsibility of the Kashag. It
     has been decided to hold a talk for peaceful negotiations in Tibet. From Lhasa, we will send
     Khenjung Thubden Lengm&#xF6;n and Sambo Tenzin Thondrub [Tib. bstan &apos;dzin don grub]. And via India,
     we are sending Kheme [Tib. khe smad] Dzasa and Trunyichemmo Thubden Tendar [Tib. thub bstan
     bstan dar]. You have had a hard time, but it is for the sake of the religion. You should not
     refrain from the hardship and please go with the two delegates to Chamdo.&quot; ,,, Usually, it
     takes 36 days to [get to] Chamdo on horseback. They asked us what I needed. My family was
     pretty well off. My gegen wasn&apos;t there at that time. My gegen, Trunyichemmo Ch&#xF6;mpel Thubden,
     was old and he knew something about the world. Before the Dalai Lama went to Yadong, he and
     Surkhang Dzasa were sent to appeal to the U.N. But, the situation then was suh that they could
     appeal right away. They stayed there for a day and the day after, and this country said that it
     was good and the other side said there was no hope [laughter]. So we went to
     Chamdo. It took us 26 days. At this time, the main army of the People&apos;s Liberation Army was at
     Lhodzong. At Pembar, there were 11 soldiers who were the liaisons [Ch. lian luo], and the head
     was Gao Buzhang. The People&apos;s Liberation Army accommodated us well at Pembar and Lhodzong. Then
     we reached Chamdo. Then two delegates gave Ngab&#xF6; the edict from the Kashag. Ngab&#xF6; and Wang
     Qimei were both very happy. On the way, we met some of the dep&#xF6;n, kudrak and the soldiers
     returning to Lhasa. They said the People&apos;s Liberation Army had given them some dayan and sent
     them home. On the next day, Ngab&#xF6; called me and he said, &quot;You are a monk with no wife and kids,
     so you should come with me to Beijing.&quot; I said, &quot;Please, I am not going at all. I could barely
     survive in the war not being killed.&quot; At that time, I was apprehensive. Gadrung Ts&#xF6;go was also
     there. Then Ngab&#xF6;&apos;s wife, who came later, also told me, &quot;Don&apos;t say that. It&apos;s better if you go.
     Ngab&#xF6; also told you to go.&quot; I was not that familiar with Ngab&#xF6;, except he kept me after I came
     to Chamdo. So we were going to leave in five days.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  What was in the letter that the Kashag sent to Ngab&#xF6;? I
     heard that it was a meaningless letter and that Ngab&#xF6; said that this was useless.   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  In the letter, it was written, &quot;The suggestion of Wang
     Qimei and Ngab&#xF6; to hold talks was very good, and we have also reported to the Dalai Lama and
     the tsondu hragdu has also decided. So you go to Beijing. There are delegates going via India
     and we are also sending two from here. You should take charge of the delegates who have the
     main power. Whatever detailed information comes up, we will contact the Dalai Lama in Yadong.
     For the time being, just start the talks.&quot; There was also an internal verbal instruction
     through the two of them, but since I was just an external staff [member], I couldn&apos;t know all
     of the instructions except for a few. So I went with Ngab&#xF6;. There was no motorable road, so we
     went on a horse down to Ganzi. They were making the road from Ganzi to Dartsedo. Then we went
     in army trucks used for carrying the shovels and the hoes. In Ganzi, the main 18th Corps was
     there, and there was the Chief of Staff, Li Canmou, and all of them were there. And Ph&#xFC;nwang
     accompanied us from Chamdo. From Ganzi, Alo Buzhang was also with us.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  Was he Tibetan?   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  No, he was Chinese. He was probably a military officer in
     the 18th Corps and he was an expert in propaganda.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  How did he know Tibetan?   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  No, he didn&apos;t know Tibetan. Ph&#xFC;nwang was the translator.
     From Dartsedo, there was an airport at Shinji, and from there we went to Chongqing by plane. We
     were welcomed by Deng Xiaoping and Li Bochen. At that time, the Southeast Military Headquarters
     [Ch. xi nan jun qu] was in Chongqing, and we knew that the two of them were the leader and also
     the military officer. Deng Xiaoping gave the main welcome speech, &quot;It is very good for you to
     come for the friendship between the Tibetans and Chinese. You don&apos;t have to be afraid.&quot; He long
     was also there at the welcome.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  Did you wear Tibetan clothes?   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  Yes, we all did. Li Bochen also gave a speech and they
     had made a stage on the way. Then there was a thin and elderly person who gave a speech. He was
     probably a Vice Director [Ch. fu zhu ren] of the Southeast Military and Administration
     Committee [Tib. lho nub dmag srid]. Later, I came to know he was Liu Wanhui of Sichuan. He
     welcomed us and visited us. At that time, I had some doubts, so I carefully listened when Deng
     Xiaoping gave a speech, but it was kind of generic. I had heard that Li Wanhui used to be a
     landlord and warlord, but later, under the arrangement of the CCP, he also gave a speech. Since
     Chamdo and Sichuan were near, I had heard he was a Guomindang general and a landlord. At that
     time, I was apprehensive, but since he was like us, and when he gave the speech, I felt a bit
     relieved and thought that there would be no problems for us and that the CCP was probably not
     easy [hard] to cope with. This was the first time I had faith towards the CCP. Otherwise, in
     many rumors it was said that the religion, landlords, the kudrak and the elderly were going to
     be destroyed. There were really these rumors spread by the imperialists. 
     Then we arrived in Beijing and the respectful Zhou Enlai came to receive us, he said, &quot;It&apos;s
     good that you have come. In the past, we have had contradictions [disagreements]. Now let&apos;s
     forget about these things that have happened the past. And in the future, whatever comments you
     have, you can tell the Central Committee, but not me. You don&apos;t need to be afraid. The Central
     Committee will tell you whatever they know and they will ask you the things that they don&apos;t
     know, and you should ask the Central Committee about whatever you don&apos;t know. We should both
     speak based on equality.&quot; He said that to Ngab&#xF6; and I was [part of] Ngab&#xF6;&apos;s staff. The two
     staffs members who came from India were Sandu Rinchen [Tib. sa &apos;du rin chen] and the
     brother-in-law of the Dalai Lama, Ph&#xFC;ntso Tashi [Tib. phun tshogs bkra shis].
     When we met there, the delegates were talking to each other. In the 17-Point Agreement, there
     were some disagreements on a few points (2-3). They sent a secret telegram with Tibetan numbers
     to the Dalai Lama in Yadong about the points of disagreement. We then got a telegram from the
     Dalai Lama saying that he didn&apos;t have any objection to accepting the Panchen Lama since this
     was also the Central Committee&apos;s idea. &quot;Go ahead and accept it.&quot; The second point was that many
     Chinese troops should not come to Tibet. &quot;If the representative of the Central Committee and
     the cadres are to come, it is okay, but tell them not to send many. And if they send a
     representative of the Central Committee, he should be someone who has faith in religion.&quot;
     [Laughter] This was the suggestion.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  Did this telegram come from Yadong?   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  Yes, this was the response telegram from Yadong. The
     delegates would discuss this and we would go near to them and listen. Ngab&#xF6; would speak frankly
     in both the old and new society. So Ngab&#xF6; had to tell about the telegram to the Central
     Committee, but they wouldn&apos;t accept it. So Ngab&#xF6; told the five delegates, &quot;It won&apos;t make any
     difference whether we report this telegram to the Central Committee or not. On the nationality
     policy and the religious policy, the CCP policy is to have freedom of religious faith. How can
     there be a representative who has faith in the religion since the main CCP doesn&apos;t have any
     religion? How can there be a person who has faith in the religion?&quot; This was an internal talk
     and these talks are still alive [still occurring today]. This was not like-it probably was like
     this.  Finally, the 17-Point Agreement was signed. At this time, Sandu
     Rinchen and I could see them signing the Agreement in the hall in the Zhongnanhai [Tib. zhong
     nan hai]. A People&apos;s Liberation Army military officer with a shaved head wearing a serge
     uniform came to us and he said to me and Sandu Rinchen in Chinese, &quot;How is everything? Is the
     [your] livelihood okay?&quot; Sandu Rinchen was a little better at Chinese and he also knew English.
     I asked Sandu Rinchen, &quot;Isn&apos;t this Commander-in-Chief Zhu de [Ch. zhu zong si lung]?&quot; Sandu
     Rinchen said, &quot;This is nonsense! How can he come to visit us?&quot; Later, [we found out] he was
     indeed Zhu de. On the day of the signing, on May 23rd, Zhu de came. So that&apos;s how we knew. The
     next day, Chairman Mao himself hosted a personal dinner. At this dinner, all of Mao&apos;s staff and
     all of the representatives were there. At the first table, Chairman Mao, Zhou Enlai, Ngab&#xF6; and
     the Panchen Lama sat side by side. And we were on the third table. Chairman Mao gave a speech
     and he said, &quot;Today, we can sign the 17-Point Agreement of Tibet. After Tibet is liberated, we
     should put into practice the CCP&apos;s policy and work lines exactly as they are. In the past-it
     has been hundreds of years since the Tibetans and the Chinese have had a friendship. And
     Tibetans internally, and also between the nationalities, didn&apos;t have a friendship. This was
     caused by the Manchu and the Chiang Kaishek government. So we should have a close friendship
     and we should developed the culture, education and the economy of Tibet. And we should also
     practice the nationality policy that all the nationalities are equal, and the period where one
     nationality suppresses another nationality is over. Since the PRC has just been founded, and we
     don&apos;t have many conditions and the Agreement is signed, you should arrange how you are going
     back to Tibet. In the future, anything you need to make the contact, just tell Zhang Jingwu.&quot;
     At that time, I didn&apos;t know he was coming to Tibet, but he was to come to Tibet. He was
     probably the Director of the General Office [Tib. ban gong shi zhu ren] of Chairman Mao, and
     also a military officer at the military headquarters in Beijing. Later, Kheme, Sandu Rinchen,
     and Sambo, went back through India, and Ngab&#xF6;, his wife, Thubden Lengm&#xF6;n, the leaders of the
     18th Corps Tan Guansan and Zhang Guohua, and I came together by land until Chamdo. After we
     arrived in Chamdo, Wang Qimei was in charge of the advanced troops of the People&apos;s Liberation
     Army, and the Regimental Commander was the one who was the principal of the Xianyang National
     Institute.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  I heard from Sambo that as soon as they received the
     telegram, the delegates held a meeting and Ngab&#xF6; said, &quot;We should, in any case, sign the
     Agreement. Otherwise, Tibet will have to suffer a great loss. It is impossible to send
     telegrams on each point of the Agreement because they will talk about the priest-patron
     relationship and the Manchu Amban, and they will make a lot of trouble and we won&apos;t come to a
     decision. If there is to be no decision, the People&apos;s Liberation Army will make war. So we
     should make a decision and not ask Yadong. In the future, if it were to be wrong, then they can
     say that they don&apos;t want to accept it. If it were to be good, then they can say that it was
     well done.&quot; The delegates came to this decision and they didn&apos;t send a telegram in the time
     between. This was what Sambo told me. Ngab&#xF6; was enthusiastic to sign the Agreement and he
     thought there would be trouble if he asked Yadong. So he thought of doing their best with
     making the decision. In the future, the Dalai Lama could say that he wouldn&apos;t accept it. Did
     this happen at that time?   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  There was no talk about this in Beijing when they held
     the talks in Beijing. After we signed the Agreement and we came to Lhasa, and when some
     delegates came through India, Zhang Jingwu was there. Ngab&#xF6; and we arrived in Lhasa and the
     17-Point Agreement was implemented. At this time, in Yadong, there was a big contradiction
     [disagreement] over whether [or not] the Dalai Lama should return to Lhasa or go abroad. The
     situation was really very tense. Zhang Jingwu was there and there were many officials who said
     that they were going to invite the Dalai Lama to Tibet. My gegen was there and he said that &quot;We
     won&apos;t bring the Dalai Lama abroad. He has to return.&quot; On the other side, there was Surkhang,
     Namseling, and probably K&#xFC;ndeling [who] said they were going to take him out. &quot;We are not going
     to hand over the Dalai Lama to the CCP.&quot; At this time, there was a letter from Chairman Mao
     which said, &quot;It was well done [It is very good that] the 17-Point Agreement was signed. There
     will be no changes to the Dalai Lama&apos;s rights, his body, and his activities.&quot; Then Zhang Jingwu
     explained and discussed taking the Dalai Lama in or out, and he returned. Ngab&#xF6; arrived in
     Lhasa and explained [the Agreement] to the Kashag. The Kashag didn&apos;t say clearly either way
     whether they would implement the 17-points or not. So the five who went to Beijing discussed
     [things] and they said, &quot;We held the talks frankly and did this. If we were wrong, tell us so
     and punish us. If we did well, tell us so. We are going to report this to the Dalai Lama and
     the tsondu gyendzom&quot; (The Full Assembly). There were a lot of arguments.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  Did they say that in the Kashag or in the tsondu?   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  This was said at the tsondu.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  TT: Was that the tsondu hragdu?   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  Yes, all the main delegates were there and later they
     reported to the Dalai Lama and he said, &quot;You delegates went there and did much work, and worked
     hard for the sake of Buddhism and the people.&quot; And he sent a telegram to Chairman Mao saying,
     &quot;The local government of Tibet and the lay and monk people of Tibet will, under the unity of
     the Central Committee, adhere to it [the Agreement],&quot; and at the end he wrote, &quot;Sent by the
     local government of Tibet and the Dalai lama.&quot; There is a historical document about this.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  I have that. But it took about a month after the meeting
     was held until the telegram was sent. In Alo Buzhang&apos;s article it explains that after the
     tsondu made the decision, the Tibetan government didn&apos;t send the telegram because they were not
     sure about what the Military Administration Committee would be. At that time, the government
     and Zhang Jingwu sent letters to each other and there was the trouble with recruiting soldiers
     and so on. Tell me about this.   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  It wasn&apos;t a month. It was about 12-13 days [from] when
     there was the trouble [to] when we held the talks there. It was between the Tibetan government
     and Labrang, about the area beyond the Gampala Pass. After most of the points were settled,
     there were a few points that the five delegates of the local government didn&apos;t accept. Although
     Tibet is a part of the PRC, internally, between the Tibetan government and Labrang, there were
     a lot of talks regarding the areas above and below Gampala. From this side [local government],
     didn&apos;t accept it, and from the Central Committee side, they put forward a suggestion saying
     that Tibet is the only one which is a part of the PRC. On the matter of [how] the Central
     Committee representatives should have religious faith and the trouble regarding Gampala, during
     the 12-13 days, the meeting was not held in Beijing because of the disagreement on the points.
     Li Weihan was the main one, and there was another Li who talked back and forth and asked what
     kind of new thoughts and methods [ideas/plans] we had. Then, finally, Li said, &quot;We will
     implement [the Agreement] according to the situation at the time of when the 13th Dalai Lama
     and the 9th Panchen Lama were friendly. How would it be if we did that?&quot; Ngab&#xF6; said that was
     fine. Then the trouble was solved. I don&apos;t know whether [or not] they had some internal
     trouble, but what I know are these two points. There were many telegrams between Yadong and
     Beijing about this issue, and it took some time.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  Did they send many telegrams to Yadong?   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  Yes, and we had to wait for them. The outside Tibetans
     said that when they heard the news about signing the Agreement from the radio, they wired you
     immediately and told the five delegates to stay in Beijing. We have some [questions and]
     comments [about this]. Did you receive this telegram?   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  No, this is not true, the dispute over accepting the
     Panchen Lama.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  Regarding the Panchen Lama, it was at the beginning of
     the talk, right?   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  It was in 1951. The delegates insisted they didn&apos;t have
     power to do this matter and we didn&apos;t accept it. So they sent the telegram to the Dalai Lama
     and it was settled by the Dalai Lama.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  Regarding the Military Administration Committee [Tib.
     dmag srid u yon lhan khang], we heard there was a dispute between Chinese and Tibetans in
     Beijing, is this true?   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  There was no disagreement over this in Beijing. According
     to the comment from the Central Committee&apos;s military headquarters [Ch. zhong yang jun wei],
     they were to set up the Military Administration Committee and they were to appoint two Vice
     Commander-in-Chiefs [Ch. fu siling] from among the famous Tibetan dignitaries who had political
     power. According to the Central Committee&apos;s will, Ngab&#xF6; was confirmed to be one of the two, and
     the local government also agreed to it. At that time, there were the two sitsab. On the name
     list of the Vice Commander-in-Chief, it was written Ngab&#xF6; and Lhalu were to be in the Military
     Administration Committee, but Lukhangwa didn&apos;t accept Lhalu at all, saying that the suitable
     person was Ragashag. So Ragashag was appointed. According to the Military Administration
     Committee down there, it was Ngab&#xF6; and Lhalu, but when Zhang Jingwu and those talked about
     this, Lukhangwa didn&apos;t agree. This was the matter, but the Military Administration Committee
     was to be set up and Tibetan Army was to be gradually converted into the People&apos;s Liberation
     Army through the Military Administration Committee. They couldn&apos;t convert them all, but the
     first ones to be converted would be the Kadang, Khadang, Gadang, and Ngadang regiments. These
     four had started converting in principle with the uniforms, though it was not completed. Their
     uniform was the People&apos;s Liberation Army uniform. The others were to be converted gradually.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  Was this written in a side document, suryig [Tib. zur
     yig], of the Agreement?   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  Yes, this was in the suryig. There were 10 points in the
     suryig. In Beijing-I didn&apos;t know there were suryigs. I learned only later. Only the Dalai Lama,
     the Sitsab, the kal&#xF6;n and the trungtsi knew about these. The other officials didn&apos;t know about
     them [laughter].   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  In the Agreement, it was said that the Military
     Administration Committee should be set up, but the Tibetan government and the Dalai Lama&apos;s
     power would also be there as before. According to your understanding, what were the differences
     between the responsibilities of the government and the Military Administration Committee?   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  Regarding the Dalai Lama, [he] would have had his power
     in Tibet as before. At that time, the Tibet Autonomous Region was not set up, which was the
     political power. Before the political power was set up, the Preparatory Committee for the Tibet
     Autonomous Region was set up. The meaning of [this was that] the Dalai Lama would have his
     power as before, that he would be the main head of the Tibet Autonomous Region which-he
     actually became the Director of the Tibet Autonomous Region. It was confirmed that there would
     not be two governments. Later, the Tibet Autonomous Region was set up and this is the
     government&apos;s political power [where the power is focused].   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  TT: You mean the political power should be transferred
     from one to the other, right?   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  Yes, we knew that it was impossible to have the Tibetan
     government and another one there.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  TT: Did you know that from that time?   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  Yes, I had this understanding of the political power,
     title, and the livelihood, and I had the understanding that there would be only one Tibetan
     government and that it was also impossible to have two governments.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  TT: What was the duty of the Military Administration
     Committee?   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  It was to gradually convert the Tibetan soldiers into
     People&apos;s Liberation Army [soldiers], and their united duty was to protect the national borders
     and the internal security of Tibet. This duty should be taken together. Therefore, the two
     Tibetan Vice Commander-in-Chiefs were appointed to work jointly. There wasn&apos;t any talk about
     all the power.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  After you came to Lhasa, what jobs did you do?   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  I understood a little of the CCP&apos;s policy. So in 1952, I
     was asked to be a gegen in the school set up by Tibetan military headquarters, where the
     People&apos;s Liberation Army [soldiers] were taught Tibetan.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  TT: Wasn&apos;t that called the Tibetan Cadre&apos;s School [Ch.
     zang gan xiao]?   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  Yes, in addition to me, there was Tangme [Tib. thang
     smad], Mrs K&#xFC;nsangtse (Lhajam), and Tsering Lhajam, who is now in India. In 1953, the visiting
     group [Tib. lta skor tshogs pa] going to inland [mainland China] was started. I was probably
     27-28 years old when the Youth League [Tib. gzhon nu mnyams &apos;brel tshogs pa] was started. In
     this, the director [Ch. zhu ren] was the Dalai Lama&apos;s brother, Lobsang Samden, and Sh&#xF6;lkang
     Thubden Nyima [Tib. zhol khang thub bstan nyi ma]. I was a committee member [Ch. wei yuan].  In 1956, I was the dzongp&#xF6;n of T&#xF6;lung Dechen Dzong. At that time, I was a fifth
     rank [official], letsenpa. Because I got married, my uniform was a Mongolian dress [Tib. sog
     chas]. At that time, the County Administration Department [Ch. ban shi chu] was established for
     making political propaganda and for [managing] livelihood. While I was the dzongp&#xF6;n, the local
     government gave me a job to work as the liaison [Ch. lian luo] between the Kashag and the
     Tibetan Work Committee. It was a dred&#xFC; [liaison] office [Tib. &apos;brel gtugs]. I would bring the
     Kashag&apos;s information to the Work Committee, mainly it was to the United Front Bureau [Ch. tong
     zhang bu], and bring their opinion back to the Kashag. So I had three responsibilities; (1) the
     dzongp&#xF6;n, (2) the liaison office, and (3) the Section Leader [Ch. ke zhang] of the Tibetan Work
     Committee, the Reception Section [Ch. gong wei jiao ji qu zhao dai ke]. My salary for the
     dzongp&#xF6;n was a little more than 400 khe of barley and some money. The salary was increased
     after the government managed the dzong so the personal income of the dzongp&#xF6;n became less.
     [There was] no salary for [the] liaison [job]. I got Chinese salary for the Reception Office.
     In the Agreement, it says, &quot;According to the political standards of the Tibetan people, reforms
     will be done.&quot; But some of the higher up kudrak and the Three Great Monasteries didn&apos;t agree.
     They held many meetings in the Jokhang and the Potala.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  When was this? Was it in 1956?   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  Yes, it was in 1956. At this time, in T&#xF6;lung Dechen
     Dzong, there were three kinds of misers. The misers of the monastery, misers of the gerpa and
     the eight shungyuba miser households. From among the shungyuba, I talked with Sedrong Yume, who
     was the older brother of Wangyal. When we were chit-chatting, [I said], &quot;Now there is no one
     who can do the reforms, so it would be good if someone could set up a trial (model).&quot; I just
     said that [while] chit-chatting. Otherwise, I could not tell them to do the reforms because I
     was the dzong. Then he said, &quot;I will do the reforms.&quot;   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  TT: Wangyal&apos;s brother might have been very smart and
     clever, right?   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  Yes-and there were the trenyog, the moyang, the tenants,
     the servants and also the nangsen who were made to work, and they also had a little bit [of]
     land. He did the reforms on about 30 households. The others didn&apos;t have the right to do them.
     He divided the land and the dzo and lent them seed, and he collected a little bit annually. And
     the government also needed the patriotic grain donation [Tib. rgyal gces gzhung &apos;bru].   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  TT: He was very famous then, right?   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  Yes, he was almost in danger of being killed. If we had
     stayed in T&#xF6;lung, most probably, it would have been difficult...   </p>
