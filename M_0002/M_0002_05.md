**Q:**  What were some of the incidents when you were <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. དགེ་སྐོས] The main disciplinary official in a monastic college (tratsang).">gegö</a>, for example the fights you mentioned and how you beat them with switches? Tell us in detail. How many monks did you beat?   

**A:**  There were about 3-4 of them who were child monks.   

**Q:**  Who beat them with switches?   

**A:**  We call the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཐབ་གཡོག] Monks or laymen who work as servants/manual laborers in kitchens (normally monastic kitchens).">thabyog</a>, but they couldn't come right away because they lived in Thambag, [Tib. དན་འབག] long way down there. So I told some monks to hold their heads and feet and the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. དགེ་སྐོས] The main disciplinary official in a monastic college (tratsang).">gegö</a> beat them.   

**Q:**  Did they fight in the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཚོགས] 1. A prayer assembly meeting in monasteries when all the monks come to an assembly hall and chant prayers together. 2. An offering made of tsamba, butter and dry cheese in the shape of a cone.">tsog</a>? What was the reason of the fight?   

**A:**  It took place after the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཚོག] 1. An offering made of tsamba, butter and dry cheese in the shape of a cone. 2. A prayer assembly meeting in monasteries when all the monks come to an assembly hall and chant prayers together.">tshog</a> when the monks went to urinate, a fight broke out. Then I seized them because I knew those monks. There wasn't any big reason.   

**Q:**  Did they hit them with fists or knives?   

**A:**  They were fighting with fists and rocks. No one carried knives.   

**Q:**  Can you give an example of criticizing or scolding someone in the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཚོག] 1. An offering made of tsamba, butter and dry cheese in the shape of a cone. 2. A prayer assembly meeting in monasteries when all the monks come to an assembly hall and chant prayers together.">tshog</a> by going in front of him?   

**A:**  In my experience, there was a monk who was smart and we had hope for him to become good. But he didn't learn the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. དཔེ་ཆ] Religious books/texts, scriptures.">pecha</a> well and he wasn't coming to the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཚོག] 1. An offering made of tsamba, butter and dry cheese in the shape of a cone. 2. A prayer assembly meeting in monasteries when all the monks come to an assembly hall and chant prayers together.">tshog</a> and <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཆོས་ར] The special grove (&quot;dharma grove&quot;) in monasteries where monks formally met to practice debating.">chöra</a> much and he was becoming spoiled. So I threatened and scolded him, "you are doing too much and you are not coming to the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཚོགས] 1. A prayer assembly meeting in monasteries when all the monks come to an assembly hall and chant prayers together. 2. An offering made of tsamba, butter and dry cheese in the shape of a cone.">tsog</a> and chöra" [Tib. ཁྱོད་རང་ཙོགས་ཆོས་རར་མ་ཡོང་པར། ཞེད་པོ་ཅིག་བྱེད་ཀྱི་འདུག་ག] and I warned him that if you don't behave well in the future, I will make you suffer severely. Otherwise, we didn't have the custom of punishing like a money fine.   

**Q:**  Who were the ones you were allowed to bring the container of the grease, shaglug, [Tib. ཞགས་བླུག] to the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཚོག] 1. An offering made of tsamba, butter and dry cheese in the shape of a cone. 2. A prayer assembly meeting in monasteries when all the monks come to an assembly hall and chant prayers together.">tshog</a>? One was the ex-gegö, right?   

**A:**  The ex-nyertsang was allowed to bring it. Once they came to the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཚོགས་འདུ] 1. The general name for the various types of Tibetan government assemblies. 2. Any assembly, e.g., the assembly (meeting) of monks in a college.">tsondu</a>, they were allowed to bring the small shaglug made from copper.   

**Q:**  Were the incumbent <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. དགེ་སྐོས] The main disciplinary official in a monastic college (tratsang).">gegö</a> and umdze allowed to bring this?   

**A:**  Yes. The <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. དགེ་སྐོས] The main disciplinary official in a monastic college (tratsang).">gegö</a> brought a very large shaglug, but the umdze's shaglug was not that big. The <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཆབ་རིལ] The Chabril&#x27;s main work was overseeing serving the traja. He was also the servant of the gegö and khempo. It had a middle status of the types of lene. The chabril was also the one responsible for beating the gong at the tsog and chöra. The chabril got an extra share of gye in the tratsang.">chabril</a> would merge two tea containers, <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཇ་ཁྲ] The type of pot that is used in monasteries to serve the monks tea at prayer assembly meetings.">chabdra</a>, [Tib. ཇ་ཁྲ] in one and bring it to the gegö to flatter the gegö. Chabril was gegö's servant. There was one ladle of tea in the container and the ex-gegö only gets one container or ladle. Usually, the tea server, chagde, [Tib. ཕག་བདེ] would divide the grease when they served the tea.   

**Q:**  Were you in a <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཁང་ཚན] A monastic residential unit in which monks from specific geographic areas lived. These were corporate entities with property and internal officials. Some large khamtsen had smaller subordinate units called mi tshan. Khamtsen were part of tratsang (colleges). For example, Hamdong Khamtsen was part of Gomang College in Drepung Monastery.">khamtsen</a>?   

**A:**  Yes. I was in Hamdong [Tib. ཧར་གདོང] Khamtsen which belonged to Gomang. Our <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. གྲྭ་ཚང] A &quot;college&quot; within a monastery, for example, in Drepung Monastery there were four main tratsang: Gomang, Loseling, Deyang and Ngagpa. These tratsang were property owning corporate entities and included monks who were organized into residential dormitories called Khamtsen.">tratsang</a> didn't have <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཁང་ཚན] A monastic residential unit in which monks from specific geographic areas lived. These were corporate entities with property and internal officials. Some large khamtsen had smaller subordinate units called mi tshan. Khamtsen were part of tratsang (colleges). For example, Hamdong Khamtsen was part of Gomang College in Drepung Monastery.">khamtsen</a> because it was a small tratsang. So we could join wherever we want to, but most of us joined Hamdong. And some also joined the Pompora, [Tib. སྤོམ་པོ་རག].   

**Q:**  Did you have to do the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. གཞོན་ཁྲལ] The work obligations all young monks have to do for the monastery (it literally means &quot;youth tax&quot;).">shöndre</a> for the Hamdong?   

**A:**  No, because we were separate tratsang.   

**Q:**  Why did they let you join their <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཁང་ཚན] A monastic residential unit in which monks from specific geographic areas lived. These were corporate entities with property and internal officials. Some large khamtsen had smaller subordinate units called mi tshan. Khamtsen were part of tratsang (colleges). For example, Hamdong Khamtsen was part of Gomang College in Drepung Monastery.">khamtsen</a>? Did they have any benefit?   

**A:**  If there was a very big call for the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. གཞོན་ཁྲལ] The work obligations all young monks have to do for the monastery (it literally means &quot;youth tax&quot;).">shöndre</a> say like doing constructions etc for the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཧར་གདོང་ཁང་ཚན] The name of a residential unit (khamtsen) found in both Drepung and Sera Monasteries.">Hamdong Khamtsen</a>, then we had to go, but not for the day in and day out things.   

**Q:**  What was the difference between joining and not joining the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཁང་ཚན] A monastic residential unit in which monks from specific geographic areas lived. These were corporate entities with property and internal officials. Some large khamtsen had smaller subordinate units called mi tshan. Khamtsen were part of tratsang (colleges). For example, Hamdong Khamtsen was part of Gomang College in Drepung Monastery.">khamtsen</a>??   

**A:**  There was no problem if we didn't join the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཁང་ཚན] A monastic residential unit in which monks from specific geographic areas lived. These were corporate entities with property and internal officials. Some large khamtsen had smaller subordinate units called mi tshan. Khamtsen were part of tratsang (colleges). For example, Hamdong Khamtsen was part of Gomang College in Drepung Monastery.">khamtsen</a>. If we joined, they wouldn't say that it was not allowed. We joined it because we got the alms in the khamtsen, if we didn't join, we would not get the alms.   

**Q:**  You also got the butter salary, right?   

**A:**  Yes, we got the Hamdong butter salary which was about 6 ngyaga = 2 <a href="#" data-tooltip="[ch. 斤] 1.1 pounds (half of a kilogram).">jin</a> paid just before the New Year. This was very famous. There were many monks joining for this butter.   

**Q:**  If there was a fight in <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. སྡེ་ཡངས] One of the colleges in Drepung Monastery.">Deyang</a>, usually the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. དགེ་སྐོས] The main disciplinary official in a monastic college (tratsang).">gegö</a> would settle it, right? If the shengo came all of sudden while you were not there, could the shengo settle it in the Deyang?   

**A:**  If the case was reported to the shengo, then he could settle it. The shengo was not allowed to come to <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. སྡེ་ཡངས] One of the colleges in Drepung Monastery.">Deyang</a> to settle a case unless someone asked him. But if the fight was coincident with the arrival of the shengo, then he could settle it on the spot. The <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. དགེ་སྐོས] The main disciplinary official in a monastic college (tratsang).">gegö</a> was there and he would settle it.   

**Q:**  Were people allowed to report the shengo directly by not reporting the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. དགེ་སྐོས] The main disciplinary official in a monastic college (tratsang).">gegö</a> first?   

**A:**  There were some people doing that and then the shengo would settle it and the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. དགེ་སྐོས] The main disciplinary official in a monastic college (tratsang).">gegö</a> did not have any authority. For example, when the shengo goes on patrolling to check the cleanliness and whether the monks were doing prayers. If the matter was serious, the shengo would settle it. When the shengo goes on patrolling, he was not allowed to go into the gegö's courtyard. This was because the gegö was holing the jayig for the jurisdiction. And vice versa, the gegö was not allowed to go to the courtyard where the shengo lives because the shengo was also holding his jayig.   

**Q:**  How many people were there in the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཚོགས་འདུ] 1. The general name for the various types of Tibetan government assemblies. 2. Any assembly, e.g., the assembly (meeting) of monks in a college.">tsondu</a> when you were <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. དགེ་སྐོས] The main disciplinary official in a monastic college (tratsang).">gegö</a>?   

**A:**  About 50-60. On the day the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཚོགས་འདུ] 1. The general name for the various types of Tibetan government assemblies. 2. Any assembly, e.g., the assembly (meeting) of monks in a college.">tsondu</a> meets it was like all the people in the tsondu were given the right to talk and disagree.   

**Q:**  And how many <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཆོས་མཛད] The title of monks who made a payment or gave gifts to secure exemption from the normal &quot;young monk&quot; work obligations. There were tratsang chöndze and khamtsen chöndze.">chöndze</a> and <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. བྱ་ཚུལ] A monastic higher status that was secured by a monk serving 3 teas and 1 thukpa having the thickness of yogurt to the monastic assembly together with giving whatever amount of gye one could afford. It was considered a stepping-stone to securing higher positions and also exempted the monk from certain work obligations.">chatsül</a>, [Tib. བྱ་ཚུལ] were there ?   

**A:**  There were only 4-5 <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཆོས་མཛད] The title of monks who made a payment or gave gifts to secure exemption from the normal &quot;young monk&quot; work obligations. There were tratsang chöndze and khamtsen chöndze.">chöndze</a> among the younger and some among the older ones, so altogether there were about 14-15. Then for the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. བྱ་ཚུལ] A monastic higher status that was secured by a monk serving 3 teas and 1 thukpa having the thickness of yogurt to the monastic assembly together with giving whatever amount of gye one could afford. It was considered a stepping-stone to securing higher positions and also exempted the monk from certain work obligations.">chatsül</a> who weren't in the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཚོགས་འདུ] 1. The general name for the various types of Tibetan government assemblies. 2. Any assembly, e.g., the assembly (meeting) of monks in a college.">tsondu</a> there were about 7-8.

It was considered a stepping-stone to securing higher positions and also exempted the monk from certain work obligations.">chatsül</a> mean?   

**A:**  I don't know the meaning.   

**Q:**  Do you spell it [Tib. བྱ] which means "do" or was it [Tib. ཇ] which means tea?   

**A:**  I don't know. Probably, this was a name of person who gives the tonggo.   

**Q:**  What was definition of the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཆོས་མཛད] The title of monks who made a payment or gave gifts to secure exemption from the normal &quot;young monk&quot; work obligations. There were tratsang chöndze and khamtsen chöndze.">chöndze</a>?   

**A:**  I think it means to teach dharma.   

**Q:**  What did you the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. དཔེ་ཆ་བ] A monk studying the monastic philosophical curriculum. A scholar monk.">pechawa</a> do during the chöntsam, [Tib. ཆོས་མཚམས]?   

**A:**  During the chöntsam, we didn't need to go to the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཚོགས] 1. A prayer assembly meeting in monasteries when all the monks come to an assembly hall and chant prayers together. 2. An offering made of tsamba, butter and dry cheese in the shape of a cone.">tsog</a> and the chöra. Once every 5 nights, the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. དཔེ་ཆ་བ] A monk studying the monastic philosophical curriculum. A scholar monk.">pechawa</a> would go to debate <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. མཚན་ཉིད] Buddhist dialectics. This is taught after the six-year curriculum called düdra.">tsenyi</a> and they went when it was almost dark and stayed there very late. The abbot and <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. དགེ་སྐོས] The main disciplinary official in a monastic college (tratsang).">gegö</a> would come and it was very strictly checked whether all have come or not. Then usually in the morning we study <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. དཔེ་ཆ] Religious books/texts, scriptures.">pecha</a> and practice at noon.   

**Q:**  During the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཆོས་ཐོག] A monastic &quot;academic semester.&quot; A period of studying/debating in the monastic curriculum that is something like a term or semester. A period of time when monks were engaged in formal studying. There were eight chöthog in a year: the autumn chöthog (tönchö [tib. སྟོན་ཆོས]) was for one month, the summer chöthog (yarchö [tib. དབྱར་ཆོས]) was for one month, the winter chöthog (günchö [tib. དགུན་ཆོས]) was for one month, and the spring chöthog (jichö [tib. དཔྱིད་ཆོས]) was for one month. Then there were also two monthly chöra called dachö [tib. ཟླ་ཆོས] and two 15 day chöra called jönga chöra [tib. བཅོ་ལྔ་ཆོས་ར].">chöthog</a> could you go to ask your teacher questions?   

**A:**  Yes. In between there was some time. First there was the morning session, <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཞོགས་ཆོས] The morning chöra (debating) session.">shogchö</a>, [Tib. ཞོགས་ཆོས]. After this ends there was traja. Then after this was finished we went to <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. 1. ཤག, 2. ཞག] 1. The apartment/room of a monk. 2. The butter fat that coagulates on the top of butter-tea when the tea is left to sit for some time. If the tea had been made with a lot of butter, this layer could be thick enough to scoop off and save to later sell or eat separately.

Then at about 1 p.m. there was <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཆོས་ར] The special grove (&quot;dharma grove&quot;) in monasteries where monks formally met to practice debating.">chöra</a> where we debated tsenyi. We didn't stay there too long. After this chöra was finished, we took out our <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. དཔེ་ཆ] Religious books/texts, scriptures.">pecha</a> and went to pecha <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. དགེ་རྒན] 1. Teacher in a school. 2. In monastic settings it also refers to an adult monk who acted as a guardian to a younger monk. In such cases, the younger monk typically lived in the gegen&#x27;s apartment (shag). In monasteries, however, it could also mean a real teacher, or the monk who served as the guarantor for a new monk.">gegen</a> to ask questions. We would say that in chöra such and such an issue came up and there were some contradictions. I said this and he said that, was it correct or not. There was not just one <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. དགེ་ཕྲུག] 1. Student. 2. Disciple. 3. Commonly the name for monks living with a gegen or teacher.

Then after this, there was the ritual, <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. སྐུ་རིམ] A religious prayer service for monks.">kurim</a>, [Tib. སྐུ་རིམ] in the chöra in late afternoon. First we did some prayers. Then the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. བླ་རྒྱུད་པ] A term for the common monks in a monastery (in contrast to the scholar monks who were actively studying the Buddhist doctrine).">lagyüba</a> would leave and the pechawa stayed a debated at night.

Then there were also two monthly chöra called dachö [tib. ཟླ་ཆོས] and two 15 day chöra called jönga chöra [tib. བཅོ་ལྔ་ཆོས་ར].">chöthog</a>, if there was alms in the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཚོགས་ཆེན] The main assembly hall of a monastery.

The assembly hall for the monastery as a whole.">tshogchen</a>, we went to the pecha gegen. And the toter gegen would give the food. We studied the pecha for a whole except there was a little break.   

**Q:**  If you wanted to go to Lhasa, could you go?   

**A:**  Yes. During the chöntsham I told my <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. དགེ་རྒན] 1. Teacher in a school. 2. In monastic settings it also refers to an adult monk who acted as a guardian to a younger monk. In such cases, the younger monk typically lived in the gegen&#x27;s apartment (shag). In monasteries, however, it could also mean a real teacher, or the monk who served as the guarantor for a new monk.">gegen</a> that I want to go to Lhasa. We were free to go. Asking him was a formality. Sometimes the gegen would send me to do something.

A scholar monk.">pechawa</a> in <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. 1. ཤག, 2. ཞག] 1. The apartment/room of a monk. 2.

**Q:**  Was there a <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཆོས་མཛད] The title of monks who made a payment or gave gifts to secure exemption from the normal &quot;young monk&quot; work obligations. There were tratsang chöndze and khamtsen chöndze.">chöndze</a>'s endowment, [Tib. ཐེབ་རྩ]?   

**A:**  Some <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཆོས་མཛད] The title of monks who made a payment or gave gifts to secure exemption from the normal &quot;young monk&quot; work obligations. There were tratsang chöndze and khamtsen chöndze.">chöndze</a> left endowments for paying salary and the alms to the monks but it was not required. This endowment would be taken in turns by the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. དངུལ་གཉེར] Accountant, bookkeeper, cashier. Someone in charge of cash.">ngünyer</a> and the chabu.   

**Q:**  What was the reason for reciting prayers in the thsog? Was it for the state or for the monastery or for the monks?   

**A:**  These in the broadest sense, were for the purpose of helping all sentient beings to achieve enlightenment, [Tib. sems can thams cad sangs rgyas kyi go 'pangs thob pa]]. It would help the sentient beings to overcome suffering and achieve happiness.   

**Q:**  Are there different prayers for different reasons?   

**A:**  They were all same. They were to help the sentient beings to achieve enlightenment. There were many kinds of the rituals to perform like the Tara Ritual, Drölchog, [Tib. སྒྲོལ་ཆོག] and the Ritual for the Medicine Buddha, Menla, [Tib. སྨན་བླ] etc. And the sponsors would request for the rituals as they wished. Some sponsors who didn't know about the religion, their purpose of giving <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. གྲྭ་ཇ] The prayer session sponsored by the tratsang (college) at which tea was served to its monks who attended.">traja</a> and alms and asking to perform the Tara Ritual was to help them to have a good fortune in their business and not to have hindrance when they travel, but not much to help all the sentient beings to overcome suffering and have happiness and to achieve enlightenment. [laughter] But the monks who perform the ritual were doing that for all the sentient beings.   

**Q:**  Was there a difference between the prayers in <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. 1. ཤག, 2. ཞག] 1. The apartment/room of a monk. 2. The butter fat that coagulates on the top of butter-tea when the tea is left to sit for some time.

**A:**  No, they were the same in meaning and intent for all the sentient beings to achieve enlightenment. In the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཚོག] 1. An offering made of tsamba, butter and dry cheese in the shape of a cone. 2.

**Q:**  Did the umdze have the authority to start whatever prayers he liked? Was there a book for him to know to say such and such prayers were to be recited on such and such dates?   

**A:**  The main thing was whatever the sponsors had written in the request for the prayers, the umdze would start that. But, when the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. གཉེར་ཚང] 1. Storehouse. 2. Steward, person in charge of a storehouse. 3.

An offering made of tsamba, butter and dry cheese in the shape of a cone.">tsog</a>, if the young monks didn't behave well, were they allowed to beat them?   

**A:**  When they change the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. དགེ་སྐོས] The main disciplinary official in a monastic college (tratsang).">gegö</a>, they would hang some switches behind the door. This was for the gegö to use it. The gegö would pretend to be angry even he was really not and tell the young monks, "aren't you behaving yourself" and he would even hit them a little bit on their nose.   

**Q:**  Did the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. དགེ་སྐོས] The main disciplinary official in a monastic college (tratsang).">gegö</a> walk back and forth in the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཚོགས] 1.

**Q:**  What was the best period of being a monk and what was the worst period before the Chinese arrival?   

**A:**  This depends on whether one faced any bad problems or had some good things happened. In general, the best period was the summer retreat, yarney [Tib. དབྱར་གནས] which was held in Drepung from the 16th of the 6th month to the 7th month. During this time, there was no <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཚོག] 1. An offering made of tsamba, butter and dry cheese in the shape of a cone. 2. A prayer assembly meeting in monasteries when all the monks come to an assembly hall and chant prayers together.">tshog</a> and <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཆོས་ར] The special grove (&quot;dharma grove&quot;) in monasteries where monks formally met to practice debating.">chöra</a> and all the monks were not allowed to go out.

At that time, we were happy and relaxed. However, we got the highest alms and salary in winter.   

**Q:**  What was the worst time?   

**A:**  If something bad happened, then it was bad, otherwise, it was kind of generic, [Tib. དེ་འདྲ་འདྲ་པོ་ཅིག་རེད].   

**Q:**  Did you live continuously with your first <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. དགེ་རྒན] 1. Teacher in a school. 2. In monastic settings it also refers to an adult monk who acted as a guardian to a younger monk. In such cases, the younger monk typically lived in the gegen&#x27;s apartment (shag).

**A:**  I did until he died. After my <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. དགེ་རྒན] 1. Teacher in a school. 2.

These are more like wards than real disciples.">gidru</a> who were <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. དཔེ་ཆ་བ] A monk studying the monastic philosophical curriculum. A scholar monk.">pechawa</a> became gegen and then I also studied pecha. They were very good in pechawa but one died in Lhasa and one died in the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. 1. ཤག, 2. ཞག] 1.

After they died, there was an old couple who were <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. མི་སེར] A term that can mean serf/bound subject as well as citizen, depending on context. For example, the miser of a lord would connote the bound subjects of that lord, whereas the miser of Tibet would connote citizens of Tibet.">miser</a> of <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཀླུ་ཁང་བ] The family name of a famous aristocratic lay official who was one of the two Sitsab in 1950-52.">Lukhangwa</a> and were living like beggars. They were related to us. They had a daughter who had a son, so I kept their son and made him a monk and kept as my gidru.   

**Q:**  How old were you then?   

**A:**  I was about 30-31 at that time. I was in the same <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. 1. ཤག, 2. ཞག] 1. The apartment/room of a monk. 2. The butter fat that coagulates on the top of butter-tea when the tea is left to sit for some time. If the tea had been made with a lot of butter, this layer could be thick enough to scoop off and save to later sell or eat separately. The senior monks are usually served tea with a lot of shag.">shag</a> from the start.   

**Q:**  Were there any friendships in the monastery as same as we have in the laymen's society like playing mahjong together and gathering together?   

**A:**  In one courtyard everyone wouldn't equally be friendly, right? Two or three of them were friends and others may not be.   

**Q:**  Was it similar with the laymen?   

**A:**  The laymen and the monastery couldn't be the same. In the monastery, there were a lot of monks visiting each other and eating foods and drinking tea. All of the monks were not that rich. So if I'm having butter tea today, I'll ask some friends to come and have some and vice versa. And sometimes, if a friend was making bagtsamargu, [Tib. བག་ཚ་མར་ཁུ], a meal with pieces of dough mixed with dry cheese and melted butter, he would tell his friends to come and have some.   

**Q:**  What was the difference between the laymen and the monks?   

**A:**  In the courtyard where laymen lived they would call each other to drink <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. 1. ཆང, 2. བྱང] 1. Tibetan locally brewed barley beer. 2. North; nomad areas north of Lhasa in Nagchuga Prefecture 3. ch. 厂 factory.">chang</a>, but we didn't have that in the monastery. In the monastery, if I make a pot of butter tea, I will go to my neighbors carrying the pot and pour them a bowl of tea and then return with the pot.   

**Q:**  In the monastery, did you lend <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. རྩམ་པ] The traditional Tibetan staple food that consists of grain that is roasted (popped), usually in heated sand, and then ground into a flour.">tsamba</a> and money to each other?   

**A:**  In the monastery we lend <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. རྩམ་པ] The traditional Tibetan staple food that consists of grain that is roasted (popped), usually in heated sand, and then ground into a flour.">tsamba</a> and money among ourselves (friends) and it was without interest. Unless it was a very large amount we did not charge interest and they would pay back when they get the alms and the salary in the tshog.   

**Q:**  What did you <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. དགེ་ཤེས] An advanced degree earned by scholar monks.">geshe</a> and monks think about the monk's homosexual custom, drompo, [Tib. mgron pop]. To me it seems it was a violation against the vows?   

**A:**  It was like a thoughtless, but carefree conduct, [Tib. སྣང་བ་སྐྱིད་པོ].   

**Q:**  Did you think this was wrong or right?   

**A:**  It was wrong because the Buddha had made 253 prohibitions for the male <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. དགེ་སློང] A monk who has taken the full set of vows.">gelong</a>, [Tib. དགེ་སློང་ཕ] and 360 prohibitions for the female gelong, [Tib. དགེ་སློང་མ]. This conduct was prohibited in these rules. Last time, I mentioned about four prohibitions for expelling monks. There were five Buddha's prohibitions. If some one violates the four, it was definite that one will be expelled. Among these five prohibitions, the one we are now talking about was done by many <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ལྡབ་ལྡོབ] A mildly deviant type of fighting or &quot;punk&quot; monk who engaged in fighting and other unusual behaviors for monks in traditional Tibet&#x27;s large monasteries.">dobdo</a> who were showing off to be brave. But they were thoughtless and they have committed a non-virtuous deed, [Tib. ཉེས་པ] because it was not allowed and this violation was called Lhagma, [Tib. ལྷག་མ]. It was also a kind if crime, [Tib. ལྟུང་བ].   

**Q:**  The monks would not do this much, right?   

**A:**  Yes.   

**Q:**  Wouldn't the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. དགེ་སྐོས] The main disciplinary official in a monastic college (tratsang).">gegö</a> regard this as a law in the monastery and put pressure, [Tib. མནན] on the monks not to do that?   

**A:**  The <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. དགེ་སྐོས] The main disciplinary official in a monastic college (tratsang).">gegö</a> would not put this pressure and it was kind of ignored, [Tib. སྣང་ཆུང] although it was not allowed and the monks would not get expelled for that.   

**Q:**  In America, I heard from a <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. དགེ་ཤེས] An advanced degree earned by scholar monks.">geshe</a> saying that the Buddha didn't prohibit this kind of homosexual. Buddha said that it was not allowed to have sex with women and have sex in the hole [anus]. So this was not illegal. Do you think so?   

**A:**  It was not like this. It's against the Buddha's 253 <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. དགེ་སློང] A monk who has taken the full set of vows.">gelong</a>'s prohibition which he made one by one when such things happened in the past. This was called Lhagma, the violation of masturbating, [Tib. ཁུ་བ་འབྱིན་པའི་ལྷག་མ]. But in the great monastic seats this was not that conspicuous and they didn't specifically say that you were not allowed to do this.   

**Q:**  Do you think it would have been better to have less <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. བླ་རྒྱུད་པ] A term for the common monks in a monastery (in contrast to the scholar monks who were actively studying the Buddhist doctrine).">lagyüba</a> and more <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. དཔེ་ཆ་བ] A monk studying the monastic philosophical curriculum. A scholar monk.">pechawa</a> and pay more salary for the pechawa?   

**A:**  No, this couldn't be done because the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. བླ་རྒྱུད་པ] A term for the common monks in a monastery (in contrast to the scholar monks who were actively studying the Buddhist doctrine).">lagyüba</a> would have objection.   

**Q:**  Wouldn't it be good to have less <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. བླ་རྒྱུད་པ] A term for the common monks in a monastery (in contrast to the scholar monks who were actively studying the Buddhist doctrine).">lagyüba</a>?   

**A:**  In the future, <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. བླ་རྒྱུད་པ] A term for the common monks in a monastery (in contrast to the scholar monks who were actively studying the Buddhist doctrine).">lagyüba</a> will become less and you didn't need to make it less because if the lagyüba didn't stay there sincerely and adhering the vows, [Tib. གཙང་མ] they would become less naturally.   

**Q:**  Trindor: I heard that there were about 4,000 monks in <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. སྒོ་མང] One of the large colleges in Drepung Monastery.">Gomang</a> just before the revolt and there were only 360 <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. དཔེ་ཆ་བ] A monk studying the monastic philosophical curriculum. A scholar monk.">pechawa</a>. So there were too many <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. བླ་རྒྱུད་པ] A term for the common monks in a monastery (in contrast to the scholar monks who were actively studying the Buddhist doctrine).">lagyüba</a> and too few pechawa, right?   

**A:**  Yes. Some <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. བླ་རྒྱུད་པ] A term for the common monks in a monastery (in contrast to the scholar monks who were actively studying the Buddhist doctrine).">lagyüba</a> even went to the north to collect offerings, büdü, [Tib. འབུལ་སྡུད] and when they come, they brought yaks and sold them here and they would hang up the yak meat in their shag.   

**Q:**  Some became farmers and some became traders, right?   

**A:**  Yes. In the future, there won't be such things and it will be clean. [laughter]
