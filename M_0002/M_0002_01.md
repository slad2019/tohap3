**Q:**  How old are you?   

**A:**  I am 71.   

**Q:**  You are from <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. སྡེ་ཡངས] One of the colleges in Drepung Monastery.">Deyang</span>, [Tib. སྡེ་ཡངས] right?   

**A:**  Yes.   

**Q:**  Are you from Lhasa?   

**A:**  I was born in Phenpo, [Tib. འཕན་པོ] and I arrived in Lhasa at age 4. My father at this time was the <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. སྤྱི་བསོ] The head managers/stewards of monasteries as a whole, especially the large Gelugpa monasteries like Sera and Drepung.">jiso</span>'s <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. ནང་ཟན] A type of serf/bound peasant who lived in the house of his or her lord and worked as a servant without pay.">nangsen</span> and the jiso called him and then we settled in Lhasa. Rinchen Lamsang, [Tib. རིན་ཆེན་ལམ་བཟང] talking: Geshe La's [Rinchen Tharchin] parent's house was here and he stayed in the monastery during his childhood.   

**Q:**  Two of you were under the same abbot's time, right?   

**A:**  Yes.   

**Q:**  I am doing some research on Drepung and I have asked Lamsang la about the <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. གཉེར་ཚང] 1. Storehouse. 2. Steward, person in charge of a storehouse. 3. A monastic official in charge of storerooms.">nyertsang</span> and <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. སྤྱི་བསོ] The head managers/stewards of monasteries as a whole, especially the large Gelugpa monasteries like Sera and Drepung.">jiso</span> those things and he doesn't clearly remember about the events took place in Deyang. Lamsang: The main thing was about the disputes that took place between the <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. དགེ་སྐོས] The main disciplinary official in a monastic college (tratsang).">gegö</span> during the time of abbot Legdrub.[Tib. ལེགས་གྲུབ]. I told them about this but I didn't know the root of the matter, so please explain it in detail about the root cause. At that time, there were Shenyen Thuwang, [Tib. བསྙེན་གཉེན་ཐུབ་དབང་ལ] and the Gen Mönlam La, [Tib. སྨོན་ལམ་ལགས] and the abbot, the ex-shengo, the <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. ཕྱག་མཛོད] A senior manager/treasurer of an aristocratic or monastic estate, or the senior manager/treasurer of an aristocratic family or a monastic unit. Generally chandzö handled both internal and external issues and were considered higher in power and status than nyerpa (stewards), who typically only handled the storerooms.">chandzö</span>, right?   

**A:**  The root of the trouble was regarding the <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. གཏོང་སྒོ] A monastic obligation to provide the food and other necessary items served at a monastic prayer assembly meeting or some other rite; this was often a required obligation for monastic officials at the end of their term of office.">tonggo</span> of the <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. དགེ་སྐོས] The main disciplinary official in a monastic college (tratsang).">gegö</span> in the tratsang. Gegö tongggo was very difficult. The gegö position was basically held by the poor common monks. This was because those who had income and wealth would take the special right "<span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. ཐོན] In monasteries, a title for monks who have finished their monastic job obligations (tib. ཐོན་ཟིན).">thön</span>', so that they did not have to do it. Lamsang also took the title of chatsü, [Tib. བྱ་ཚུལ] and didn't need to be the gegö.   

**Q:**  If you took the chatsü, you don't need to be the <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. དགེ་སྐོས] The main disciplinary official in a monastic college (tratsang).">gegö</span>, right?   

**A:**  Yes. Lamsang: I got the chatsü title because it was given as a reward to my late <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. དགེ་རྒན] 1. Teacher in a school. 2. In monastic settings it also refers to an adult monk who acted as a guardian to a younger monk. In such cases, the younger monk typically lived in the gegen&#x27;s apartment (shag). In monasteries, however, it could also mean a real teacher, or the monk who served as the guarantor for a new monk.">gegen</span> by the tratsang.   

**Q:**  Did you give the <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. གཏོང་སྒོ] A monastic obligation to provide the food and other necessary items served at a monastic prayer assembly meeting or some other rite; this was often a required obligation for monastic officials at the end of their term of office.">tonggo</span> after six months or before that?   

**A:**  The <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. དགེ་སྐོས] The main disciplinary official in a monastic college (tratsang).">gegö</span>'s <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. གཏོང་སྒོ] A monastic obligation to provide the food and other necessary items served at a monastic prayer assembly meeting or some other rite; this was often a required obligation for monastic officials at the end of their term of office.">tonggo</span> was given just before the six months term ends. The gegö had to give the monks 2 all day traja. Each day there were three assemblies, [Tib. ཚོགས་དུས]. The gegö was very hard and they couldn't give the tonggo. At this time, the monks petitioned the abbot that these gegö tonggo were very difficult to give. And the gegö were all from the poor monks. So please reduce the requirements of the tonggo. This was presented in the <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. གྲྭ་ཚང] A &quot;college&quot; within a monastery, for example, in Drepung Monastery there were four main tratsang: Gomang, Loseling, Deyang and Ngagpa. These tratsang were property owning corporate entities and included monks who were organized into residential dormitories called Khamtsen.">tratsang</span> <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. ཚོགས་འདུ] 1. The general name for the various types of Tibetan government assemblies. 2. Any assembly, e.g., the assembly (meeting) of monks in a college.">tsondu</span>. In the tsondu, there was the abbot and there were eloquent abbot's partners. They said this can not be. Then the common monks put a great effort. At that time, they held a tsondu gyeba [Tib. ཚོགས་འདུ་རྒྱས་པ] for changing the gegö and the old and the new gegö were both at the tsondu. On this day the monks met separately in the <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. ཆོས་ར] The special grove (&quot;dharma grove&quot;) in monasteries where monks formally met to practice debating.">chöra</span> and then the common monks rushed up to the tsondu to make the petition. Then some people stopped them and they [tsondu] said that this was not going to be okay. And they caught the monks who came to petition and they also caught the old and the new gegö and they beat the new gegö with switches and they were shut in the room and they also shut in the old gegö. The new gegö died and then the old gegö was shut in and beaten with switches and died after 3 or 4 days. The main complain was that the gegö could not give the tonggo, so they requested to reduce, [Tib. ཆག་ཆ] the tonggo. The monks had the reason for rising up to insist on changing this because the 13th Dalai Lama gave <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. སྡེ་ཡངས] One of the colleges in Drepung Monastery.">Deyang</span> the charter, jayig, [Tib. བཅའ་ཡིག] and in this, it was not written what the gegö had to do. Later they changed the content of the jayig and increased the tonggo and made the gegö to give that tonggo.   

**Q:**  Who ordered the beating with switches?   

**A:**  The main one was the abbot and there were a few partners. And they were very active where the other <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. ཚོགས་འདུ] 1. The general name for the various types of Tibetan government assemblies. 2. Any assembly, e.g., the assembly (meeting) of monks in a college.">tsondu</span> members didn't have much [power] and they were watching it.   

**Q:**  There was no dispute between the old and new <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. དགེ་སྐོས] The main disciplinary official in a monastic college (tratsang).">gegö</span>, right?   

**A:**  Yes. They were standing on one side because both of them were poor monks.   

**Q:**  The common monks were standing behind the <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. དགེ་སྐོས] The main disciplinary official in a monastic college (tratsang).">gegö</span>, right?   

**A:**  Yes. The common monks were not allowed to go to the <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. ཚོགས་འདུ] 1. The general name for the various types of Tibetan government assemblies. 2. Any assembly, e.g., the assembly (meeting) of monks in a college.">tsondu</span>, they met in the chöra. Then when the monks rushed up, some tsondu members carried sticks and came to beat the monks.   

**Q:**  Who settled it?   

**A:**  This is not a matter that the shengo can settle. The new <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. དགེ་སྐོས] The main disciplinary official in a monastic college (tratsang).">gegö</span> [called Chöndzin La [Tib. ཆོས་འཛིན་ལགས] died and the junior shengo had to notify the government saying that the gegö died this morning. This was done, and then the next morning he had to go and say that the older gegö Khyenden Chognang [Tib. མཁྱེན་ལྡན་མཆོག་སྣང] had died after the beating. Then the <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. སྡེ་བ་གཞུང] The name of the traditional Tibetan government.">dewashung</span> ordered the 2 shengo to settle it. These two had been killed and if you kill someone you can't stay in the monastery. So the abbot Legdrub, [Tib. ལེགས་གྲུབ] and the abbot's <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. དགེ་རྒན] 1. Teacher in a school. 2. In monastic settings it also refers to an adult monk who acted as a guardian to a younger monk. In such cases, the younger monk typically lived in the gegen&#x27;s apartment (shag). In monasteries, however, it could also mean a real teacher, or the monk who served as the guarantor for a new monk.">gegen</span> who was the ex-shengo [Tib. ཞལ་ཟུར], the <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. བླ་བྲང] 1. The property/wealth owning corporate entity of an incarnate lama. 2. The property/wealth owning corporate entity of the Panchen Lama.">labrang</span> chandzö, the ex-gegö Shenyen Thuwangla, [Tib. བཤེས་གཉེན་ཐུབ་དབང་ལགས] and ex-gegö Mönlam la, [Tib. སྨོན་ལམ་ལགས]. About 7 people were expelled and beaten with switches. The decision came very fast from the shengo. They were beaten with switches at the <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. ཚོགས་ཆེན] The main assembly hall of a monastery. The assembly hall for the monastery as a whole.">tsogchen</span> stone floor. They were then clothed in white chuba and expelled. That day, the lords of these 7 monks were summoned and they were handed over to their lords and sent back with them to the countryside.   

**Q:**  Was anyone from monks expelled?   

**A:**  No because the justice was on the common monks' side.   

**Q:**  So the <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. ཚོགས་འདུ] 1. The general name for the various types of Tibetan government assemblies. 2. Any assembly, e.g., the assembly (meeting) of monks in a college.">tsondu</span> members were expelled, right?   

**A:**  Yes, the ones who supported the abbot were expelled.   

**Q:**  The reason why the abbot beat the <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. དགེ་སྐོས] The main disciplinary official in a monastic college (tratsang).">gegö</span> was because the gegö said that they can't give the <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. གཏོང་སྒོ] A monastic obligation to provide the food and other necessary items served at a monastic prayer assembly meeting or some other rite; this was often a required obligation for monastic officials at the end of their term of office.">tonggo</span>, right?   

**A:**  Yes and the new <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. དགེ་སྐོས] The main disciplinary official in a monastic college (tratsang).">gegö</span> was kind of eloquent and reported very strongly on the <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. ཚོགས་འདུ] 1. The general name for the various types of Tibetan government assemblies. 2. Any assembly, e.g., the assembly (meeting) of monks in a college.">tsondu</span> and he was holding the jayig issued by the 13th Dalai Lama's jayig and the gegö also had a lot of power. And they beat the gegö while he was holding the jayig. The new gegö was saying we can give the <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. གཏོང་སྒོ] A monastic obligation to provide the food and other necessary items served at a monastic prayer assembly meeting or some other rite; this was often a required obligation for monastic officials at the end of their term of office.">tonggo</span> whatever was written in the jayig and you cannot increase the tonggo that is not written in the jayig.   

**Q:**  Were they saying that the two <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. དགེ་སྐོས] The main disciplinary official in a monastic college (tratsang).">gegö</span> were the ringleader of that case? Lamsang: They were saying that they were the ones who first raised the issue.   

**Q:**  Did they beat the common monks with switches?   

**A:**  No, they didn't. But the common monks were very strong then. So they couldn't arrest and beat them because the justice was on their side.   

**Q:**  Did they beat the <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. དགེ་སྐོས] The main disciplinary official in a monastic college (tratsang).">gegö</span> on the same day of the <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. ཚོགས་འདུ] 1. The general name for the various types of Tibetan government assemblies. 2. Any assembly, e.g., the assembly (meeting) of monks in a college.">tsondu</span>?   

**A:**  It was on the same day where they called them to the <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. ཚོགས་འདུ] 1. The general name for the various types of Tibetan government assemblies. 2. Any assembly, e.g., the assembly (meeting) of monks in a college.">tsondu</span> and beat them on the roof top. Lamsang: At this time, didn't the new <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. དགེ་སྐོས] The main disciplinary official in a monastic college (tratsang).">gegö</span> chöndzin la lay down and said, go ahead and beat me? He was very tough and was holding the jayig. But they ignored the jayig and beat him.   

**A:**  Actually, when one is holding the jayig, no one is allowed to punish him even if he committed some crime. One would have to wait until after his term is over and then settle it.   

**Q:**  After this what happened with the <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. གཏོང་སྒོ] A monastic obligation to provide the food and other necessary items served at a monastic prayer assembly meeting or some other rite; this was often a required obligation for monastic officials at the end of their term of office.">tonggo</span>? Lamsang; one of the <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. དགེ་སྐོས] The main disciplinary official in a monastic college (tratsang).">gegö</span> who died was called Khyenden Choglang, [Tib. མཁྱེན་ལྡན་མཆོག་གླང], right?   

**A:**  Yes, he was the old one.   

**Q:**  How did they settle it?   

**A:**  After that, the <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. ཚོགས་འདུ] 1. The general name for the various types of Tibetan government assemblies. 2. Any assembly, e.g., the assembly (meeting) of monks in a college.">tsondu</span> met for many times and finally they decided that they will follow the 13th Dalai Lama's jayig and give the <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. གཏོང་སྒོ] A monastic obligation to provide the food and other necessary items served at a monastic prayer assembly meeting or some other rite; this was often a required obligation for monastic officials at the end of their term of office.">tonggo</span> according to the jayig. Finally, the common monks won the case.   

**Q:**  At this time, did the people from laji come to the <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. གྲྭ་ཚང] A &quot;college&quot; within a monastery, for example, in Drepung Monastery there were four main tratsang: Gomang, Loseling, Deyang and Ngagpa. These tratsang were property owning corporate entities and included monks who were organized into residential dormitories called Khamtsen.">tratsang</span> tsondu?   

**A:**  No. <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. བླ་སྤྱི] The highest administrative council in large monasteries, like Drepung. It consisted of the Abbots, the Tshogchen Umdze, the Shengo and the Jiso. In Drepung it also included ex-abbots.">Laji</span> was not involved in that. Lamsang: After that, was the new abbot Rinchen Gyantsen la, [Tib. རིན་ཆེན་རྒྱལ་མཚན་ལགས]?   

**A:**  No. It was Shenyen Tsöndrü La, [Tib. bshes gnyen brtson 'grus lahs]. Lamsang: and after him was Rinchen Gyentsen la, right?   

**A:**  Yes.   

**Q:**  When was this? Was it after the Sera War?   

**A:**  It was before the Sera War. Lamsang: it has been two abbot terms before that.   

**Q:**  Was the regent <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. སྟག་བྲག] The regent of Tibet who replaced Reting in 1941 and served until 1950 when the 14th Dalai Lama assumed power.">Taktra</span> or Reting?   

**A:**  It was Taktra.   

**Q:**  So it was in 1941-42 43. Lamsang: They were expelled from the monastery in the morning when they paid us the grain salary.   

**Q:**  Was there a fixed time of the grain salary?   

**A:**  Lamsang: No. It depends when ever the <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. གཉེར་ཚང] 1. Storehouse. 2. Steward, person in charge of a storehouse. 3. A monastic official in charge of storerooms.">nyertsang</span> had the time. [Note: the dobdo said it was when he was 27 so that would be 1945]

**A:**  Usually the <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. ཐབ་གཡོག] Monks or laymen who work as servants/manual laborers in kitchens (normally monastic kitchens).">thabyog</span> did that. If the <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. དགེ་སྐོས] The main disciplinary official in a monastic college (tratsang).">gegö</span> was very angry, he would beat them. But at this time it was the <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. ཚོགས་འདུ] 1. The general name for the various types of Tibetan government assemblies. 2. Any assembly, e.g., the assembly (meeting) of monks in a college.">tsondu</span> members themselves. Lamsang: Yes the ones who rushed to beat them were; Shenyen Thuwang, Mönlam la.   

**A:**  And there was <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. ཕྱག་མཛོད] A senior manager/treasurer of an aristocratic or monastic estate, or the senior manager/treasurer of an aristocratic family or a monastic unit. Generally chandzö handled both internal and external issues and were considered higher in power and status than nyerpa (stewards), who typically only handled the storerooms.">chandzö</span> Gyentsen Legtshog, [Tib. rgyan mtsan leg tshogs]. Lamsang: Was there the abbot's <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. དགེ་རྒན] 1. Teacher in a school. 2.

The general name for the various types of Tibetan government assemblies. 2.

At that moment, they were too aggressive and beat them with the switches very severely. So the switches broke and the pieces of wood point stuck into their fleshes and their legs were severely swollen and didn't look like human leg and their leg became like beams. They beat them on their lower part of the body. I and my <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. དགེ་རྒན] 1. Teacher in a school. 2. In monastic settings it also refers to an adult monk who acted as a guardian to a younger monk. In such cases, the younger monk typically lived in the gegen&#x27;s apartment (shag).

I went to help the new <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. དགེ་སྐོས] The main disciplinary official in a monastic college (tratsang).">gegö</span> as his servant and at that moment, he was almost dying.

**Q:**  How many times did they beat them with the switches?   

**A:**  They didn't have the time to count it. Lamsang: They beat them like 100-200-300-400 times. Otherwise, people won't die so easily. They might have hit them and also poked them with the switches.   

**Q:**  They were angry because the monks talked back to them, right?   

**A:**  Yes.   

**Q:**  What was the main work of the <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. དགེ་སྐོས] The main disciplinary official in a monastic college (tratsang).">gegö</span> of <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. སྡེ་ཡངས] One of the colleges in Drepung Monastery.">Deyang</span> which you did?

There is a big book in which they are all listed. You had to keep looking in it and see if they have done the tonggo as specified. There were two <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. དགེ་སྐོས] The main disciplinary official in a monastic college (tratsang).">gegö</span>; one for the monks gathering in summer for the debate, yarchö, [Tib. དབྱར་ཆོས] and the winter monks gathering in summer for the debate, günchö, [Tib. དགུན་ཆོས] and the gegö had to check whether the tonggo were given completely. And if some tonggo is missing, then the gegö would tell them to give the tonggo.   

**Q:**  Was it done with the uchö?   

**A:**  No, the <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. དགེ་སྐོས] The main disciplinary official in a monastic college (tratsang).">gegö</span> does it by himself.   

**Q:**  Then what else do the <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. དགེ་སྐོས] The main disciplinary official in a monastic college (tratsang).">gegö</span> do?   

**A:**  The <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. དགེ་སྐོས] The main disciplinary official in a monastic college (tratsang).">gegö</span> had the power and was in charge of <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. གྲྭ་ཚང] A &quot;college&quot; within a monastery, for example, in Drepung Monastery there were four main tratsang: Gomang, Loseling, Deyang and Ngagpa. These tratsang were property owning corporate entities and included monks who were organized into residential dormitories called Khamtsen.">tratsang</span> discipline. In <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. སྡེ་ཡངས] One of the colleges in Drepung Monastery.">Deyang</span>, we didn't have the custom of any money fines, but the gegö would criticize or scold, [Tib. བཀའ་སྒྱུར] the monks like who don't come to the <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. ཚོགས] 1. A prayer assembly meeting in monasteries when all the monks come to an assembly hall and chant prayers together. 2. An offering made of tsamba, butter and dry cheese in the shape of a cone.">tsog</span> and the chöra.

**Q:**  Does the <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. དགེ་སྐོས] The main disciplinary official in a monastic college (tratsang).">gegö</span> have the authority to expel the monks?
