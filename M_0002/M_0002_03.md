**A:**  When you became the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. རབ་བྱུང] Monastic vows.">rabjung</a>, [Tib. རབ་བྱུང] you had not yet gotten the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. དགེ་ཚུལ] 1. The novice vows that Buddhist monks and nuns take. 2. A monk who has taken such vows.">getsül</a> vow. For the getsül vow you could ask an abbot or the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཡོངས་འཛིན] A tutor of a high lama or the Dalai Lama.">Yongdzin</a> of the Dalai Lama or the Dalai Lama and Tri Rimpoche, [Tib. ཁྲི་རིན་པོ་ཆེ] and you had to stay on long lines. On that day, you took the red cushion called Dinga, [Tib. འདིང་བ], mala and some more things. And the lama would give the vow and from that day you got the getsül vow. Once you have taken these vows, if you don't behave well and don't keep the vow well, then you can be expelled. Then later you will take the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. དགེ་སློང] A monk who has taken the full set of vows.">gelong</a> vows.   

**Q:**  What are the various kinds of <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཐོན] In monasteries, a title for monks who have finished their monastic job obligations (tib. ཐོན་ཟིན).">thön</a> those who have special privilege, [Tib. དམིགས་བསལ་དབང་ཆ]? Is thön and special privilege same?   

**A:**  Those who have the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཐོན] In monasteries, a title for monks who have finished their monastic job obligations (tib. ཐོན་ཟིན).">thön</a> are the people who have special privilege for example, after you did the chatsü and <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཆོས་མཛད] The title of monks who made a payment or gave gifts to secure exemption from the normal &quot;young monk&quot; work obligations. There were tratsang chöndze and khamtsen chöndze.">chöndze</a>, then your special privilege is that you don't have to do the gegö.   

**Q:**  Are the positions of chatsü and <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཆོས་མཛད] The title of monks who made a payment or gave gifts to secure exemption from the normal &quot;young monk&quot; work obligations. There were tratsang chöndze and khamtsen chöndze.">chöndze</a> called <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཐོན] In monasteries, a title for monks who have finished their monastic job obligations (tib. ཐོན་ཟིན).">thön</a>?   

**A:**  No they aren't called thön.   

**Q:**  What is called <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཐོན] In monasteries, a title for monks who have finished their monastic job obligations (tib. ཐོན་ཟིན).">thön</a>?   

**A:**  When you give a <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. གཏོང་སྒོ] A monastic obligation to provide the food and other necessary items served at a monastic prayer assembly meeting or some other rite; this was often a required obligation for monastic officials at the end of their term of office.">tonggo</a> to get exempted or avoided from doing something like <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. གཞོན་ཁྲལ] The work obligations all young monks have to do for the monastery (it literally means &quot;youth tax&quot;).">shöndre</a>, this is called thön.   

**Q:**  When you finish the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. དགེ་སྐོས] The main disciplinary official in a monastic college (tratsang).">gegö</a> and become the ex-gegö, do they call it having <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཐོན] In monasteries, a title for monks who have finished their monastic job obligations (tib. ཐོན་ཟིན).">thön</a>?   

**A:**  Yes they call it <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཐོན] In monasteries, a title for monks who have finished their monastic job obligations (tib. ཐོན་ཟིན).">thön</a> and say that you have the thön of gegö.   

**Q:**  What kind of special privilege did this <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཐོན] In monasteries, a title for monks who have finished their monastic job obligations (tib. ཐོན་ཟིན).">thön</a> have?   

**A:**  There is no real special privilege except for getting into the tsondu.   

**Q:**  Did they have the special privilege to keep 2 or 3 <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. དགེ་ཕྲུག] 1. Student. 2. Disciple. 3. Commonly the name for monks living with a gegen or teacher. These are more like wards than real disciples.">gidru</a> who didn't have to do the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. གཞོན་ཁྲལ] The work obligations all young monks have to do for the monastery (it literally means &quot;youth tax&quot;).">shöndre</a>?   

**A:**  Among the ex-gegö, there are the both the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. བླ་རྒྱུད་པ] A term for the common monks in a monastery (in contrast to the scholar monks who were actively studying the Buddhist doctrine).">lagyüba</a> and the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. དཔེ་ཆ་བ] A monk studying the monastic philosophical curriculum. A scholar monk.">pechawa</a>. Those pechawa geshe are allowed to keep many <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. དགེ་ཕྲུག] 1. Student. 2. Disciple. 3. Commonly the name for monks living with a gegen or teacher. These are more like wards than real disciples.">gidru</a>. We have no custom like the gidru did not have to do the shöndre.   

**Q:**  Like the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. གཉེར་ཚང] 1. Storehouse. 2. Steward, person in charge of a storehouse. 3. A monastic official in charge of storerooms.">nyertsang</a>, did they have the privilege to keep <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. དགེ་ཕྲུག] 1. Student. 2. Disciple. 3.

**A:**  They have the privilege to keep <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. དགེ་ཕྲུག] 1. Student. 2. Disciple. 3. Commonly the name for monks living with a gegen or teacher. These are more like wards than real disciples.">gidru</a>, but did not have the privilege that they do not have do the shöndre.   

**Q:**  When you become the ex-gegö, did you have the privilege of wearing their clothes?   

**A:**  In general, monks are not allowed to wear sleeves or the boots called somba [Tib. ཟོན་པ] [villager's type of boots]. But when the monks go into the villages, they just go against the rule and wear these. At <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. འཇང་དགུན་ཆོས] The special winter debating session for monks that was held annually in the area called Jang.">Jang günchö</a> it is very cold and they go there in 11th month and return in 12th month, so the on the way the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. དགེ་ཤེས] An advanced degree earned by scholar monks.">geshe</a> surreptitiously wear garments and sompa boots. The <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཕྱག་སྦུག] A manager (of estates and endowments) of a monastic college or monastic khamtsen.">chabu</a> and <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. གཉེར་ཚང] 1. Storehouse. 2. Steward, person in charge of a storehouse. 3. A monastic official in charge of storerooms.">nyertsang</a> are also not allowed to wear those clothes.   

**Q:**  How did those people who have special privilege get alms and salary? Could they send a person to get their alms?   

**A:**  The <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. གཉེར་ཚང] 1. Storehouse. 2. Steward, person in charge of a storehouse. 3. A monastic official in charge of storerooms.">nyertsang</a> and <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཕྱག་སྦུག] A manager (of estates and endowments) of a monastic college or monastic khamtsen.">chabu</a> had special privilege and they don't have to go to the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཚོགས] 1. A prayer assembly meeting in monasteries when all the monks come to an assembly hall and chant prayers together. 2. An offering made of tsamba, butter and dry cheese in the shape of a cone.">tsog</a>. They sent their <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. དགེ་ཕྲུག] 1. Student. 2. Disciple. 3. Commonly the name for monks living with a gegen or teacher. These are more like wards than real disciples.">gidru</a> and after the tsog was finished they got their alms and salary outside the main gate, <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. སྒོ་མཆོར] The area outside of the monastic assembly hall that is supported by tall pillars.">gomchor</a>, [Tib. སྒོ་མཆོར] when their name was read out. They didn't have to go in person. This was the same for alms and salary [in Deyang]. Other monks had to go in person to the tsog.   

**Q:**  Those who gave the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. གཏོང་སྒོ] A monastic obligation to provide the food and other necessary items served at a monastic prayer assembly meeting or some other rite; this was often a required obligation for monastic officials at the end of their term of office.">tonggo</a> to buy up <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. གཞོན་ཁྲལ] The work obligations all young monks have to do for the monastery (it literally means &quot;youth tax&quot;).">shöndre</a>, did they have to go to the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཚོགས] 1. A prayer assembly meeting in monasteries when all the monks come to an assembly hall and chant prayers together. 2. An offering made of tsamba, butter and dry cheese in the shape of a cone.">tsog</a>?   

**A:**  They had to go to the tsog.   

**Q:**  What about one called getting the share, <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. སྐལ་ལེན] A special right allowing certain monks to take their share of alms outside of the prayer assembly hall. This privilege meant they did not have to attend the prayer session to get their alms.">kelen</a>, [Tib. སྐལ་ལེན]?   

**A:**  These monks came to the assembly hall before the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཚོགས] 1. A prayer assembly meeting in monasteries when all the monks come to an assembly hall and chant prayers together. 2. An offering made of tsamba, butter and dry cheese in the shape of a cone.">tsog</a> was finished and at the time when alms were being given out, they will get their shares. They had to come in person. These are the people without special privilege. They had to ask the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. དགེ་སྐོས] The main disciplinary official in a monastic college (tratsang).">gegö</a> for permission not to attend tsog and get the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. སྐལ་ལེན] A special right allowing certain monks to take their share of alms outside of the prayer assembly hall. This privilege meant they did not have to attend the prayer session to get their alms.">kelen</a> in order to be eligible for getting kelen and mostly the gegö would say yes. In the big <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. གྲྭ་ཚང] A &quot;college&quot; within a monastery, for example, in Drepung Monastery there were four main tratsang: Gomang, Loseling, Deyang and Ngagpa. These tratsang were property owning corporate entities and included monks who were organized into residential dormitories called Khamtsen.">tratsang</a> probably they didn't have to ask such permission and they sat on the stone floor to get the alms.   

**Q:**  Who were the ones with special privilege? The chatsü, <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཆོས་མཛད] The title of monks who made a payment or gave gifts to secure exemption from the normal &quot;young monk&quot; work obligations. There were tratsang chöndze and khamtsen chöndze.">chöndze</a>, ex-gegö, ex-<a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. གཉེར་ཚང] 1. Storehouse. 2. Steward, person in charge of a storehouse. 3. A monastic official in charge of storerooms.">nyertsang</a>, the incumbent nyertsang, abbot, <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཕྱག་སྦུག] A manager (of estates and endowments) of a monastic college or monastic khamtsen.">chabu</a>, ex-abbot ex-chabu, <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. བླ་བྲང] 1. The property/wealth owning corporate entity of an incarnate lama. 2. The property/wealth owning corporate entity of the Panchen Lama.">labrang</a> chandzö and then who else? Was the lama shungnepa there?   

**A:**  Yes, lama shungnepa was there if he had done the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. དགེ་སྐོས] The main disciplinary official in a monastic college (tratsang).">gegö</a>. If he hasn't done gegö, he was not allowed to come to the tshondu meetings. Even the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. དགེ་ཤེས] An advanced degree earned by scholar monks.">geshe</a> can't come to tshondu unless they have finished the gegö. The chatsü would become <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. གཉེར་ཚང] 1. Storehouse. 2. Steward, person in charge of a storehouse. 3. A monastic official in charge of storerooms.">nyertsang</a> and the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཆོས་མཛད] The title of monks who made a payment or gave gifts to secure exemption from the normal &quot;young monk&quot; work obligations. There were tratsang chöndze and khamtsen chöndze.">chöndze</a> would become chabu.   

**Q:**  Is lama shungnepa a kind of monk's obligation?   

**A:**  It was kind of obligation. It goes by the rank of <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. དགེ་ཤེས] An advanced degree earned by scholar monks.">geshe</a> who was the oldest in the seniority.   

**Q:**  What is the duty of lama shungnepa?   

**A:**  Each year, there would be 2-3-4 new <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. དགེ་ཤེས] An advanced degree earned by scholar monks.">geshe</a>. At the time, they gave the geshe tonggo in the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཚོགས] 1. A prayer assembly meeting in monasteries when all the monks come to an assembly hall and chant prayers together. 2. An offering made of tsamba, butter and dry cheese in the shape of a cone.">tsog</a> and the lama shungnepa have to recite lot of prayers from the main text. At this time, the geshe gives a meal to the lama shungnepa, the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. དགེ་སྐོས] The main disciplinary official in a monastic college (tratsang).">gegö</a> and the umdze.   

**Q:**  The <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. དགེ་སྐོས] The main disciplinary official in a monastic college (tratsang).">gegö</a> gives two <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. གཏོང་སྒོ] A monastic obligation to provide the food and other necessary items served at a monastic prayer assembly meeting or some other rite; this was often a required obligation for monastic officials at the end of their term of office.">tonggo</a>?   

**A:**  In the past before the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. སྡེ་ཡངས] One of the colleges in Drepung Monastery.">Deyang</a> trouble. The <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. དགེ་སྐོས] The main disciplinary official in a monastic college (tratsang).">gegö</a> had to give 9 traja. Later when the abbot was expelled, it was reduced to only two traja.   

**Q:**  When they serve 9 <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. གྲྭ་ཇ] The prayer session sponsored by the tratsang (college) at which tea was served to its monks who attended.">traja</a>, did they have to serve both the tea and the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཐུག་པ] 1. A porridge or gruel-like soup typically made with tsamba, and if available, meat and cheese. 2. Noodle dishes in broth.">thukpa</a>?   

**A:**  Probably, that was done before the Sera War. There were all day <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཚོགས] 1. A prayer assembly meeting in monasteries when all the monks come to an assembly hall and chant prayers together. 2. An offering made of tsamba, butter and dry cheese in the shape of a cone.">tsog</a> in the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. གྲྭ་ཚང] A &quot;college&quot; within a monastery, for example, in Drepung Monastery there were four main tratsang: Gomang, Loseling, Deyang and Ngagpa. These tratsang were property owning corporate entities and included monks who were organized into residential dormitories called Khamtsen.">tratsang</a> [Tib. ཉིན་འཁྱོངས]. We gave one <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. གྲྭ་ཇ] The prayer session sponsored by the tratsang (college) at which tea was served to its monks who attended.">traja</a> on the 14th of the 6th month and when we do the ritual to propitiate the deity, kangso, [Tib. བསྐངས་གསོ]. And on the 15th we give the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. གཏོང་སྒོ] A monastic obligation to provide the food and other necessary items served at a monastic prayer assembly meeting or some other rite; this was often a required obligation for monastic officials at the end of their term of office.">tonggo</a> for the whole day. In 11th month, one day just before handing over, we would give the same tonggo. There were 3 traja each of these days so this made 9 traja.   

**Q:**  Was this given before or after becoming gegö.   

**A:**  It was given after one starts to be the gegö.   

**Q:**  When was the change over of <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. དགེ་སྐོས] The main disciplinary official in a monastic college (tratsang).">gegö</a>?   

**A:**  It was during the great summer gathering for the debate, yarchö chemo, [Tib. དབྱར་ཆོས་ཆེན་མོ] on 5th month 15-16 of month when they held the meeting and the old <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. དགེ་སྐོས] The main disciplinary official in a monastic college (tratsang).">gegö</a> resigned and the new gegö take the position. They gave this <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. གཏོང་སྒོ] A monastic obligation to provide the food and other necessary items served at a monastic prayer assembly meeting or some other rite; this was often a required obligation for monastic officials at the end of their term of office.">tonggo</a> when taking over and the handing over the gegö. And just before finishing the gegö, they had to give a tea called the ending tea, <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. བཞུགས་བྱ] The Tsendrön monk official who was the &quot;on duty&quot; attendant at the Dalai Lama&#x27;s Secretariat (tib. གག). After the Gag was recessed [after the Drungja] and the Dalai Lama had returned to his room, the Tsendrön shugja stayed at the Gag like a guard. He attended to those who came for audiences, serving tea, snacks, and when the Dalai Lama&#x27;s call bell rang, he answered and stayed like an attendant.">shugja</a> [Tib. གཞུག་ཇ]   

**Q:**  Where did the income for doing this come from?   

**A:**  He had no special funds for this. There was the extra share but nothing else. Therefore the trouble over the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. དགེ་སྐོས] The main disciplinary official in a monastic college (tratsang).">gegö</a> tonggo was because of this.   

**Q:**  Did the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. དགེ་སྐོས] The main disciplinary official in a monastic college (tratsang).">gegö</a> have some endowment?   

**A:**  No.   

**A:**  So how did the monks manage to do this because they needed a lot of butter?   

**A:**  They had to take loans to do this. Most ex- <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. དགེ་སྐོས] The main disciplinary official in a monastic college (tratsang).">gegö</a> had debts to pay off. [laughter] Let me tell you an incident. This happened when I was young. There was a monk who was told it was his turn to be the gegö. He tried to but couldn't get excused from it and he was very poor and couldn't afford the tonggo. So in his courtyard there was a room where the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. གྲྭ་ཚང] A &quot;college&quot; within a monastery, for example, in Drepung Monastery there were four main tratsang: Gomang, Loseling, Deyang and Ngagpa. These tratsang were property owning corporate entities and included monks who were organized into residential dormitories called Khamtsen.">tratsang</a>'s butter was stored. So he stole a load of butter from the storeroom and took it into his <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. 1. ཤག, 2. ཞག] 1. The apartment/room of a monk. 2. The butter fat that coagulates on the top of butter-tea when the tea is left to sit for some time. If the tea had been made with a lot of butter, this layer could be thick enough to scoop off and save to later sell or eat separately. The senior monks are usually served tea with a lot of shag.">shag</a> and hid it in his storage where he kept is dung [Tib. ལྕི་ཁང] Then he said he will do the gegö. When they noticed that the butter was lost, many monks had suspicion that he stole it. And the child monk from the neighbors shag would tease him saying "Uncle, didn't you see the load of butter? Don't you have the butter load in your shag?". On day, people knew about this and in the evening when they were holding the ritual, <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. སྐུ་རིམ] A religious prayer service for monks.">kurim</a>, [Tib. སྐུ་རིམ] -it was just getting dark-so while he was at kurim, the shengo and <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ནང་མ] A minor monk assistant to the Shengo at the Mönlam Chemmo Prayer Festival. These nangma ranked below the Chagdampa.">nangma</a> seized him and tied him with a black rope and then beat him with switches. Then they put him in the "jail."   

**Q:**  Did they expel him?   

**Q:**  He was expelled because he stole. I saw this myself. If you are okay economically, you can do the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. དགེ་སྐོས] The main disciplinary official in a monastic college (tratsang).">gegö</a> and then be the ex-gegö and get into the tsondu. You have a bigger name, otherwise no profit.   

**Q:**  I heard that when the sponsors would give money gift when they came to ask to read the list for requesting prayers, kyabtho, [Tib. སྐྱབ་ཐོ]?   

**A:**  No. They gave the kyabtho wrapped in a <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཁ་བཏགས] A Tibetan ceremonial scarf given to lamas, visitors, etc.">khata</a> to the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. དགེ་སྐོས] The main disciplinary official in a monastic college (tratsang).">gegö</a>, but no money. The gegö keeps the khata. We also keep the kyabtho's (paper) which we use to plaster the roof.   

**Q:**  Did it sometimes happen that if the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. དགེ་སྐོས] The main disciplinary official in a monastic college (tratsang).">gegö</a> can't read well, the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཆབ་རིལ] The Chabril&#x27;s main work was overseeing serving the traja. He was also the servant of the gegö and khempo. It had a middle status of the types of lene. The chabril was also the one responsible for beating the gong at the tsog and chöra. The chabril got an extra share of gye in the tratsang.">chabril</a> did it by standing behind him?   

**A:**  Ha ha. [laughter] Yes. You had asked a lot. I remember the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. དགེ་སྐོས] The main disciplinary official in a monastic college (tratsang).">gegö</a> before me who couldn't read printing script, ujen [Tib. དབུ་ཅན] or the written form, <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. དབུ་མེད] The style of &quot;headless&quot; Tibetan writing that is intermediate between printed style and cursive.">umey</a> [Tib. དབུ་མེད]. So when he had to read kyabtho, he couldn't read so the chabri read the kyabtho after the gegö said, "Today so and so sponsor is giving alms" Then the chabri read the actual kyabtho.   

**Q:**  Was there a custom of the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. དགེ་སྐོས] The main disciplinary official in a monastic college (tratsang).">gegö</a> begging for donation for the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. གཏོང་སྒོ] A monastic obligation to provide the food and other necessary items served at a monastic prayer assembly meeting or some other rite; this was often a required obligation for monastic officials at the end of their term of office.">tonggo</a>?.   

**A:**  Yes. The <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. དགེ་སྐོས] The main disciplinary official in a monastic college (tratsang).">gegö</a> would go to Lhasa after New Years to beg from the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. སྐུ་དྲག] 1. A member of the lay aristocracy. 2. Title for government lay and monk officials. 3. A name occasionally used for the top leaders/officials in a monastery.">kudrak</a> who had relation with the Deyang.   

**Q:**  Did most of them give the donation?   

**A:**  Yes they did. Then just before the revolt the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. སྐུ་དྲག] 1. A member of the lay aristocracy. 2. Title for government lay and monk officials. 3. A name occasionally used for the top leaders/officials in a monastery.">kudrak</a> said that it was not good to beg for the donation and all the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. སྡེ་ཡངས] One of the colleges in Drepung Monastery.">Deyang</a>'s sponsor collected some donation and started an endowment. But we didn't get the money because it was just before the revolt.   

**Q:**  When did you do the gegö.   

**A:**  Not long before the revolt when I was 37 years old.   

**Q:**  How was the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཕྱག་སྦུག] A manager (of estates and endowments) of a monastic college or monastic khamtsen.">chabu</a> selected? I heard that one from ex-nyertsang, one ex-gegö, one from the common monks and one from the chöndze. I heard that they select some candidates from among the common monks.   

**A:**  In the past, I remember that one <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཆོས་མཛད] The title of monks who made a payment or gave gifts to secure exemption from the normal &quot;young monk&quot; work obligations. There were tratsang chöndze and khamtsen chöndze.">chöndze</a> called Tempa, [Tib. བསྟན་པ] and one called Pöpö became the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཕྱག་སྦུག] A manager (of estates and endowments) of a monastic college or monastic khamtsen.">chabu</a> and there was one from the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. གཉེར་ཚང] 1. Storehouse. 2. Steward, person in charge of a storehouse. 3. A monastic official in charge of storerooms.">nyertsang</a>, one from ex-gegö and one from the common monks.   

**Q:**  How were they selected? Did the common monks have the power?

An offering made of tsamba, butter and dry cheese in the shape of a cone.">tsog</a> and then gives it back to chabril who hand it on pillar again. [then the gegö walks back and forth in tsog carrying a iron stick [Tib. ལྕག་རྒྱུག] Another job of chabril, is to tell the chagde [Tib. ཕྱག་བདེ] to which rows they should go to serve tea. The name chabril comes from water. Also, at the end of the tsog he carries water in a vase [Tib. བུམ་པ] around the tsog. In the old times, he would pour water in each monks' hands and monks to rinks their mouth, but later don't do that. In <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. སྡེ་ཡངས] One of the colleges in Drepung Monastery.">Deyang</a>, the chabril has no power.

**A:**  If such a person come to give alms, first he goes to abbot and he makes the decision. Then the abbot would give the order to the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. དགེ་སྐོས] The main disciplinary official in a monastic college (tratsang).">gegö</a> saying that such and such sponsor wants to give <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. གཏོང་སྒོ] A monastic obligation to provide the food and other necessary items served at a monastic prayer assembly meeting or some other rite; this was often a required obligation for monastic officials at the end of their term of office.">tonggo</a> on such as such day, is it all right? The reason for asking is that the gegö not only has the 13th Dalai Lama's jayig, but also the list of the tonggo. The gegö says yes.

**Q:**  After you say okay, then would you send the person to the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. གཉེར་ཚང] 1. Storehouse. 2. Steward, person in charge of a storehouse. 3. A monastic official in charge of storerooms.">nyertsang</a>?

**Q:**  Who tells the tea servers, chagde, [Tib. ཕྱག་བདེ] when to serve tea?   

**A:**  In the tsog- when to serve tea is said by the umdze. He will give a head signal while the prayer is ending. Then the young monks will quickly get up and go to the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. རུང་ཁང] A monastic kitchen.">rungkhang</a>. Then they will get tea from the rungkhang and return and stand in a line by front wall. Then the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཆབ་རིལ] The Chabril&#x27;s main work was overseeing serving the traja. He was also the servant of the gegö and khempo. It had a middle status of the types of lene. The chabril was also the one responsible for beating the gong at the tsog and chöra.

The chabril got an extra share of gye in the tratsang.">chabril</a> go into <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. རུང་ཁང] A monastic kitchen.">rungkhang</a>?   

**A:**  He can but doesn't have to since he is not involved there. He stand off to one side of the assembly hall. When the tea is served, he has to count the number of ex-gegö who get the grease of the tea. And each 2 ex-gegö get 1 tea container called japtra [Tib. ཇ་ཁྲ] equally. The ex-gegö carries a grease container [Tib. ཞག་ཕོར] and the tea server would pour the grease equally to the two ex-gegö. The rest of the monks just get one bowl of tea and there is no grease on it.   

**Q:**  What about <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཐུག་པ] 1. A porridge or gruel-like soup typically made with tsamba, and if available, meat and cheese. 2. Noodle dishes in broth.">thukpa</a>? How did they serve it?

In <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. སྒོ་མང] One of the large colleges in Drepung Monastery.">Gomang</a> there is pushing and fighting etc by the dobdo. In Deyang there is no pushing.   

**Q:**  Do the monks get one ladle or two?   

**A:**  They get two. In <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. སྡེ་ཡངས] One of the colleges in Drepung Monastery.">Deyang</a>, they put the container on the floor and serve the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཐུག་པ] 1. A porridge or gruel-like soup typically made with tsamba, and if available, meat and cheese. 2. Noodle dishes in broth.">thukpa</a> but in Gomnag they hold the container in the servers' hand.

**Q:**  When you were young who were there in your <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. 1. ཤག, 2. ཞག] 1. The apartment/room of a monk. 2.

The senior monks are usually served tea with a lot of shag.">shag</a>? Was your shagtsang a big one?   

**A:**  No we weren't a big shagtsang. I came to Lhasa at age 4. My <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. དགེ་རྒན] 1. Teacher in a school. 2. In monastic settings it also refers to an adult monk who acted as a guardian to a younger monk. In such cases, the younger monk typically lived in the gegen&#x27;s apartment (shag). In monasteries, however, it could also mean a real teacher, or the monk who served as the guarantor for a new monk.">gegen</a> used to stay in my house in Lhasa at Mönlam, [Tib. སྨོན་ལམ]. So after Mönlam, when the gegen returned I said I want to go with him and went to Drepung. Then at Tsongchö, [Tib. ཚོགས་མཆོད] Prayer Festival, I returned to Lhasa. Then after tsongchö I went back to monastery with my gegen and that's how I became a monk. At this time, there was the gegen, two older <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. དགེ་ཕྲུག] 1. Student. 2. Disciple. 3. Commonly the name for monks living with a gegen or teacher. These are more like wards than real disciples.">gidru</a> and me; 4 people. The 2 older gidru were good in <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. དཔེ་ཆ] Religious books/texts, scriptures.">pecha</a> but died before they passed the geshe.   

**Q:**  Did you like to learn <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. དཔེ་ཆ] Religious books/texts, scriptures.">pecha</a> right away?   

**A:**  I knew the alphabets before I went to the monastery because my father was Kashag's sweeper and he taught me. So when I got to the monastery, probably I could learn some, so everyone said "oh he has a good memory". Then my father bought up the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. གཞོན་ཁྲལ] The work obligations all young monks have to do for the monastery (it literally means &quot;youth tax&quot;).">shöndre</a> for me and I started studying <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. མཚན་ཉིད] Buddhist dialectics. This is taught after the six-year curriculum called düdra.">tsenyi</a> in the takrig grade and I became the pechawa. At this time, the butter was cheap, 1 <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. རྒྱ་མ] A unit of weight equal to one jin [ch. 斤] (1.1 lbs).">gyama</a> of butter was 1 sang. Money was valuable then.   

**Q:**  How old where you when you were <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. དགེ་སྐོས] The main disciplinary official in a monastic college (tratsang).">gegö</a>?   

**A:**  I was 37. It was just before I passed my <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. དགེ་ཤེས] An advanced degree earned by scholar monks.">geshe</a> exam. It was in the same year I passed geshe and became the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. དགེ་སྐོས] The main disciplinary official in a monastic college (tratsang).">gegö</a>. I became the gegö in summer and passed the geshe exam in that winter.
