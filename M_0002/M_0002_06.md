**Q:** [Note: For the first section the subject repeated the dates the chöra were held so it was not translated again] [TN Note: As noted above, the first section where the subject tells different dates of the chöra was regarded as a repeat and was not translated, but I found there are many new important questions and answers given in more details in this long section. So I translated the full section]   

**Q:**  I know about the main four monthly <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཆོས་ར] The special grove (&quot;dharma grove&quot;) in monasteries where monks formally met to practice debating.">chöra</a> or <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཆོས་ཐོག] A monastic &quot;academic semester.&quot; A period of studying/debating in the monastic curriculum that is something like a term or semester. A period of time when monks were engaged in formal studying. There were eight chöthog in a year: the autumn chöthog (tönchö [tib. སྟོན་ཆོས]) was for one month, the summer chöthog (yarchö [tib. དབྱར་ཆོས]) was for one month, the winter chöthog (günchö [tib. དགུན་ཆོས]) was for one month, and the spring chöthog (jichö [tib. དཔྱིད་ཆོས]) was for one month. Then there were also two monthly chöra called dachö [tib. ཟླ་ཆོས] and two 15 day chöra called jönga chöra [tib. བཅོ་ལྔ་ཆོས་ར].">chöthog</a>, but what are the 20 days chöra, [Tib. ཉི་ཤུ་ཆོས་ར]?   

**A:**  In between the Mönlam, [Tib. སྨོན་ལམ] and the Tsongchö, [Tib. ཚོགས་མཆོད], there was one called Barchö Chöra, [Tib. བར་ཆོས་ཆོས་ར]. This was called the 15 days <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཆོས་ར] The special grove (&quot;dharma grove&quot;) in monasteries where monks formally met to practice debating.">chöra</a>, [Tib. བཅོ་ལྔ་ཆོས་ར] because it only has 15 days.   

**Q:**  What month and dates did they hold this <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཆོས་ར] The special grove (&quot;dharma grove&quot;) in monasteries where monks formally met to practice debating.">chöra</a>?   

**A:**  This <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཆོས་ར] The special grove (&quot;dharma grove&quot;) in monasteries where monks formally met to practice debating.">chöra</a> started from the 3rd of the 2nd lunar month until around 17th of 2nd lunar month. And on the 18th, the monks had to go to for the Tsongchö.   

**Q:**  Did the Tsongchö start on the 18th of the 2nd lunar month?   

**A:**  Yes, it started on the 18th and ended on the 30th. This was held in Lhasa not in Drepung. After the great spring <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཆོས་ར] The special grove (&quot;dharma grove&quot;) in monasteries where monks formally met to practice debating.">chöra</a>, [Tib. དཔྱིད་ཆོས་ཆེན་མོ] then the month commemorating the Buddha's birth, enlightenment and Para Nirvana, Sagadawa, [Tib. sa ga lza ba] started on the 1st of the 4th lunar month and ended on the 15th, but there was no chöra because during that there was no tsog.   

**Q:**  This was the break, chöntsham, [Tib. ཆོས་མཚམས] right?   

**A:**  Yes. From the 17th or 18th, there was a <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཆོས་ར] The special grove (&quot;dharma grove&quot;) in monasteries where monks formally met to practice debating.">chöra</a> called the exam chöra, [Tib. རྒྱུགས་སྤྲོད] which was also 15 days. From the 15th-16th of the fifth lunar month, till the 15th- 16th of the 6th lunar month, the great summer retreat, yarchö <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཆེན་མོ] 1. Abbr. of the name of the Dalai Lama&#x27;s Lord Chamberlain (Drönyerchemmo). 2. Title for the highest status craftsmen in traditional Tibet.">chenmo</a> [Tib. དབྱར་ཆོས་ཆེན་མོ] starts which was held for one and half months and there was no chöra during this time which was called the great chöntsam. On the 30th of the 7th month, the Jongyu, [Tib. ལྗོངས་རྒྱུ] where the monks who went far distances. On the 3rd of the 7th lunar month, Rigtra Chenmo, [Tib. རིགས་གྲྭ་ཆེན་མོ] would be held which was for giving tonggo. On the 3rd of the 8th lunar month, there was a monthly chöra which was called the great autumn chöra, tönchö chenmo [Tib. སྟོན་ཆོས་ཆེན་མོ].   

**Q:**  What is the meaning of Rigtra?   

**A:**  This was for giving us <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. གཏོང་སྒོ] A monastic obligation to provide the food and other necessary items served at a monastic prayer assembly meeting or some other rite; this was often a required obligation for monastic officials at the end of their term of office.">tonggo</a> and going to get the salary and the alms. I am not sure about the meaning.   

**Q:**  How many days did the Rigtra take place?   

**A:**  This was also during the great chöntsam and from the 3rd of the 8th lunar month till the beginning if the 9th lunar month there was the bathing picnic, [Tib. ཆབ་ཞུགས] and the great autumn retreat, tönchö <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཆེན་མོ] 1. Abbr. of the name of the Dalai Lama&#x27;s Lord Chamberlain (Drönyerchemmo). 2. Title for the highest status craftsmen in traditional Tibet.">chenmo</a>, [Tib. སྟོན་ཆོས་ཆེམ་མོ] would be held.   

**Q:**  How many days did the Rigtra take place?   

**A:**  There were three Rigtra; the big, middle and the small, [Tib. ཆེ་ཁག་འབྲིང་ཁག་ཆུང་ཁག]. Ours was the middle one which was for 12 days.   

**Q:**  Was this for all the Drepung or only for <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. སྡེ་ཡངས] One of the colleges in Drepung Monastery.">Deyang</a>?   

**A:**  The <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. གཏོང་སྒོ] A monastic obligation to provide the food and other necessary items served at a monastic prayer assembly meeting or some other rite; this was often a required obligation for monastic officials at the end of their term of office.">tonggo</a> was given by <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. སྡེ་ཡངས] One of the colleges in Drepung Monastery.">Deyang</a> to all of Drepung. It was also done by turns.   

**Q:**  Did each <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. གྲྭ་ཚང] A &quot;college&quot; within a monastery, for example, in Drepung Monastery there were four main tratsang: Gomang, Loseling, Deyang and Ngagpa. These tratsang were property owning corporate entities and included monks who were organized into residential dormitories called Khamtsen.">tratsang</a> hold their Rigtra?   

**A:**  <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. བློ་གསལ་གླིང] One of the main colleges in Drepung Monastery.">Loseling</a> held their Rigtra in the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཚོགས་ཆེན] The main assembly hall of a monastery.

There were 2 middle ones also held in the tsogchen.   

**Q:**  Did the government give the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. གཏོང་སྒོ] A monastic obligation to provide the food and other necessary items served at a monastic prayer assembly meeting or some other rite; this was often a required obligation for monastic officials at the end of their term of office.">tonggo</a> or was it given by the laji?   

**A:**  The 6 abbots gave this <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. གཏོང་སྒོ] A monastic obligation to provide the food and other necessary items served at a monastic prayer assembly meeting or some other rite; this was often a required obligation for monastic officials at the end of their term of office.">tonggo</a> by turn and they also had a lot of income to collect like from Rama Shiga in Phenpo, [Tib. འཕན་པོ] and they also got butter etc from other sources.   

**Q:**  Did two abbots give this by turn?   

**A:**  No. One abbot would give this tonggo. And the small Rigtra was for 10 days. The middle one was given by <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. སྡེ་ཡངས] One of the colleges in Drepung Monastery.">Deyang</a> and the Gyepa. The small one was given by Shagor, [Tib. ཤག་སྒོར] and the Düwa, [Tib. འདུལ་བ].   

**Q:**  All the monks of Drepung came to the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཚོགས] 1. A prayer assembly meeting in monasteries when all the monks come to an assembly hall and chant prayers together. 2. An offering made of tsamba, butter and dry cheese in the shape of a cone.">tsog</a>, right?   

**A:**  Yes.   

**Q:**  From where the monks of Gyepa come?   

**A:**  The Gyepa abbot would give the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. གཏོང་སྒོ] A monastic obligation to provide the food and other necessary items served at a monastic prayer assembly meeting or some other rite; this was often a required obligation for monastic officials at the end of their term of office.">tonggo</a>, but the abbot did not go to the tsog.   

**Q:**  They had to give the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. གཏོང་སྒོ] A monastic obligation to provide the food and other necessary items served at a monastic prayer assembly meeting or some other rite; this was often a required obligation for monastic officials at the end of their term of office.">tonggo</a> because they got the income from the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. གཞིས་ཀ] A manorial estate.">shiga</a>, right?   

**A:**  Yes. This was like a <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. གཉེར་པ] A steward or manager. In some monasteries, the nyerpa was in charge of storerooms under the authority of a higher manager called a chandzö.">nyerpa</a> or <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཕྱག་མཛོད] A senior manager/treasurer of an aristocratic or monastic estate, or the senior manager/treasurer of an aristocratic family or a monastic unit. Generally chandzö handled both internal and external issues and were considered higher in power and status than nyerpa (stewards), who typically only handled the storerooms.">chandzö</a> who collected the income and gave the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. གཏོང་སྒོ] A monastic obligation to provide the food and other necessary items served at a monastic prayer assembly meeting or some other rite; this was often a required obligation for monastic officials at the end of their term of office.">tonggo</a> by turn.   

**Q:**  I heard from a Geyog, [Tib. དགེ་གཡོག] of <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. སྡེ་ཡངས] One of the colleges in Drepung Monastery.">Deyang</a> that the abbot of Deyang who was in the same <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. 1. ཤག, 2. ཞག] 1.

If the tea had been made with a lot of butter, this layer could be thick enough to scoop off and save to later sell or eat separately. The senior monks are usually served tea with a lot of shag.">shag</a> died within the 6 years term and the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. གྲྭ་ཚང] A &quot;college&quot; within a monastery, for example, in Drepung Monastery there were four main tratsang: Gomang, Loseling, Deyang and Ngagpa. These tratsang were property owning corporate entities and included monks who were organized into residential dormitories called Khamtsen.">tratsang</a> had to give the tonggo.   

**A:**  Yes, the abbot was called Dzogchen, [Tib. རྫོགས་ཆེན] who died just before his term was over. Then <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. སྡེ་ཡངས] One of the colleges in Drepung Monastery.">Deyang</a> appointed two <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. དགེ་ཤེས] An advanced degree earned by scholar monks.">geshe</a> as his substitute.   

**Q:**  After Rigtra <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཆེན་མོ] 1. Abbr. of the name of the Dalai Lama&#x27;s Lord Chamberlain (Drönyerchemmo). 2. Title for the highest status craftsmen in traditional Tibet.">chenmo</a>, the great autumn retreat was held, right?   

**A:**  Yes. It was for one month from 3rd of 8th lunar month to the 3rd of the 9th lunar month. From the 2nd of 9th month, it was also chöntsam and from the 16th and 17th, we would white wash the houses and there was a <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཆོས་ར] The special grove (&quot;dharma grove&quot;) in monasteries where monks formally met to practice debating.">chöra</a> called Sakar, [Tib. ས་དཀར] chöra for 20 days. From 1st-2nd of the 10th lunar month, there was a chöntsam and then from the 16th-17h of the 10th lunar month, there was the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ལྔ་མཆོད] The Ganden Ngamjö holiday commemorating the death of Tsongkapa. It falls on the 25th of the 10th Tibetan lunar month.">Ngamjö</a> Chöra for one month. From 2nd and the 3rd of the 11th lunar month, there was another chöntsam and there was no tsog. From the 16th-17th of the 11 lunar month, the great winter retreat, günchö <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཆེན་མོ] 1. Abbr. of the name of the Dalai Lama&#x27;s Lord Chamberlain (Drönyerchemmo). 2. Title for the highest status craftsmen in traditional Tibet.">chenmo</a>, [Tib. དགུན་ཆོས་ཆེན་མོ] was held.   

**Q:**  Was the great winter retreat and the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. འཇང་དགུན་ཆོས] The special winter debating session for monks that was held annually in the area called Jang.">Jang günchö</a> same?   

**A:**  No. <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. འཇང་དགུན་ཆོས] The special winter debating session for monks that was held annually in the area called Jang.">Jang günchö</a> was held down there in Jang.   

**Q:**  Were they held at the same time?   

**A:**  No. <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. འཇང་དགུན་ཆོས] The special winter debating session for monks that was held annually in the area called Jang.">Jang günchö</a> was held on 1st-2nd of the 11 lunar month till the 15th of the 12th lunar month and the monks would stay in Ratö, [Tib. ར་སྟོད] and the great winter retreat was held on the 16th-17th of 11th lunar month.   

**Q:**  So the monks couldn't attend both of these, right?   

**A:**  Yes. [TN note: above this is the first section]   

**Q:**  The grades of <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. སྡེ་ཡངས] One of the colleges in Drepung Monastery.">Deyang</a> and <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. སྒོ་མང] One of the large colleges in Drepung Monastery.">Gomang</a> are different. Is this correct?   

**A:**  Yes. In <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. སྒོ་མང] One of the large colleges in Drepung Monastery.">Gomang</a>, there was no khatog grammar, düming and the düchen.   

**Q:**  In <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. སྡེ་ཡངས] One of the colleges in Drepung Monastery.">Deyang</a>, the 1st grade was the khatog grammar, right?   

**A:**  Yes, the 2nd was the düming, the 3rd was <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. བསྡུས་ཆེན] The third class in the düdra monastic curriculum.">düchen</a> and then 4th was takrig, 5th was lurig, 6th was Namdrel, [Tib. རྣམ་འགྲེལ], 7th was Pharchin, [Tib. ཕར་ཕྱིན], and then uma, [Tib. དབུ་མ] and then dzö, [Tib. མཛོད] and then düwa, [Tib. འདུལ་བ]. And there was also a grade of old monks that have passed the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཆོས་ར] The special grove (&quot;dharma grove&quot;) in monasteries where monks formally met to practice debating.">chöra</a> and they were called the 1st grade called dzin, [Tib. འཛིན], 2nd grade, 3rd grade and the 4th grade. These are the grades of the ex-monastic officials, <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཐོན་ཟིན] The ex-monastic officials who had the title of &quot;thon&quot; by virtue of having completed their monastic job obligations.">thönsin</a>, [Tib. ཐོན་ཟིན].   

**Q:**  Was it like the karampa,[Tib. བཀའ་རམ་པ] 1st grade and the 2nd grade?   

**A:**  No. In <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. སྒོ་མང] One of the large colleges in Drepung Monastery.">Gomang</a>, karampa were the ones who study the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. མཚན་ཉིད] Buddhist dialectics. This is taught after the six-year curriculum called düdra.">tsenyi</a>. The above mentioned 1st and 2nd grade had passed all the tsenyi grades and the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. གཞོན་ཁྲལ] The work obligations all young monks have to do for the monastery (it literally means &quot;youth tax&quot;).">shöndre</a> in the tratsang.   

**Q:**  The <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. སྒོ་མང] One of the large colleges in Drepung Monastery.">Gomang</a> had the khatog grammar, khatog gong and <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. བསྡུས་འབྲིང] The second class in the düdra monastic curriculum.">düdring</a> and <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. བསྡུས་ཆེན] The third class in the düdra monastic curriculum.">düchen</a>, right?   

**A:**  These four were the düdra.   

**Q:**  Did they study the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. བསྡུས་གྲྭ] The first curriculum in Buddhist dialectics in Gelugpa monasteries. It is an abbreviated course in logic (tib. ཙེམ [ཚད་མ]). There are 6 classes and monks ideally study one class each year. The first class is khatog garmar [tib. ཁ་དོག་དཀར་དམར], followed by düdring [tib. བསྡུས་འབྲིང], then düchen [tib. བསྡུས་ཆེན], then tagrik [tib. རྟགས་རིག], and then finally lurik [tib. བླུ་རིག].">düdra</a> before the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. མཚན་ཉིད] Buddhist dialectics. This is taught after the six-year curriculum called düdra.">tsenyi</a>?   

**A:**  Yes. This was the base for practicing the intelligence [Tib. རིག་པ] for studying <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. མཚན་ཉིད] Buddhist dialectics. This is taught after the six-year curriculum called düdra.">tsenyi</a> and they had takrig, lurig, Pharchin and the döndönchö, [Tib. འདོན་འདོན་ཆོས] which was also a part of Pharchin.   

**Q:**  They also had the shungwog, [Tib. གཞུང་འོག] and shungong, [Tib. གཞུང་གོང]. Since it was different between the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. གྲྭ་ཚང] A &quot;college&quot; within a monastery, for example, in Drepung Monastery there were four main tratsang: Gomang, Loseling, Deyang and Ngagpa. These tratsang were property owning corporate entities and included monks who were organized into residential dormitories called Khamtsen.">tratsang</a>, if they asked you a question from shungong, how would you answer it if you hadn't studied them?   

**A:**  We study and gave answers according to the texts of the 5th Dalai Lama and only the way of debating was not same but the actual meaning was the same. They also would debate according to the words of the Jayang Shepa, [Tib. འཇམ་དབྱངས་བཞད་པ]. There were some texts like Namdrel, [Tib. རྣམ་འགྲེལ] that should be learned by all the great monastic seats.   

**Q:**  In <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. སྡེ་ཡངས] One of the colleges in Drepung Monastery.">Deyang</a>, from what grade did they pass the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. དགེ་ཤེས] An advanced degree earned by scholar monks.">geshe</a>?   

**A:**  They passed the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. དགེ་ཤེས] An advanced degree earned by scholar monks.">geshe</a> from Pharchin, <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. དབུ་མ] The Madhyamaka text (&quot;the Middle Way&quot;).">Uma</a> and Dzö and then they studied the Düwa and then they gave the name of the geshe and drew the lots and then passed the geshe exam.   

**Q:**  Was the number of years for studying <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. མཚན་ཉིད] Buddhist dialectics. This is taught after the six-year curriculum called düdra.">tsenyi</a> in <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. སྡེ་ཡངས] One of the colleges in Drepung Monastery.">Deyang</a> and <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. སྒོ་མང] One of the large colleges in Drepung Monastery.">Gomang</a> the same or not?   

**A:**  It was almost the same except 1-2 years difference.   

**Q:**  Who went faster? Was it <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. སྒོ་མང] One of the large colleges in Drepung Monastery.">Gomang</a> or <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. སྡེ་ཡངས] One of the colleges in Drepung Monastery.">Deyang</a>?   

**A:**  Sometimes <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. སྡེ་ཡངས] One of the colleges in Drepung Monastery.">Deyang</a> went faster, sometimes <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. སྒོ་མང] One of the large colleges in Drepung Monastery.">Gomang</a> was faster. There were more candidates in Gomang for <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. དགེ་ཤེས] An advanced degree earned by scholar monks.">geshe</a> Lharamba because there were more monks studying <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. དཔེ་ཆ] Religious books/texts, scriptures.">pecha</a> in Gomang. Deyang had less geshe.   

**Q:**  What were the functions of the grades: 1st, 2nd, etc.?   

**A:**  These are the ones who have finished their geshe. They just put their names there and they can go for circumambulating as they wish or stay in their <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. 1. ཤག, 2. ཞག] 1. The apartment/room of a monk. 2. The butter fat that coagulates on the top of butter-tea when the tea is left to sit for some time. If the tea had been made with a lot of butter, this layer could be thick enough to scoop off and save to later sell or eat separately. The senior monks are usually served tea with a lot of shag.">shag</a> do some prayers. There was no other work to do and it was up to their whether they go to the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཚོགས] 1. A prayer assembly meeting in monasteries when all the monks come to an assembly hall and chant prayers together. 2. An offering made of tsamba, butter and dry cheese in the shape of a cone.">tsog</a> or not.   

**Q:**  What happens to those monks who have the enthusiasm to become <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. དགེ་ཤེས] An advanced degree earned by scholar monks.">geshe</a> but weren't intelligent enough to do it? If they couldn't debate well, would they get expelled?   

**A:**  No. They wouldn't get expelled. Everyone had to look at his own capabilities and if he thinks he can do <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. དགེ་ཤེས] An advanced degree earned by scholar monks.">geshe</a>, he will do it, if he thinks he can't, then he will resign from <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. དཔེ་ཆ་བ] A monk studying the monastic philosophical curriculum. A scholar monk.">pechawa</a> on his own. He would go to the abbot and say I can't become pechawa because I don't understand, so I would like to resign. There was no throwing out, but there was a lot of examining and looking at the candidates to see who was really qualified for Lharamba, or Tsogrampa, [Tib. ཙོགས་རམས་པ] etc. Internally, the abbot and the monks will know who was better and who was worse, but the abbot would go through the motions of examining them and then the abbot used his final authority and say who was Lharamba, or Tsogrampa.   

**Q:**  What happened if someone thinks they are okay, but if others think that he is really terrible, [Tib. སེམས་ཐག་རེད]? Even if he took the exams, and he failed. Could he get the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. དགེ་ཤེས] An advanced degree earned by scholar monks.">geshe</a> like the tsogrampa?   

**A:**  Unless, the monk's condition was at least so-so, they won't put him in tshogrampa <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. དགེ་ཤེས] An advanced degree earned by scholar monks.">geshe</a>. The people would think that he will be unable to become tsogrampa geshe. The reason for this was that the tshogrampa had to take test in front of the Dalai Lama. If he wasn't qualified to be the geshe, the Dalai Lama would say he isn't adequate for tsogrampa and would tell them to send a substitute and have this monk study for a few more years.   

**Q:**  Did the tsogrampa take their exam in the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. གྲྭ་ཚང] A &quot;college&quot; within a monastery, for example, in Drepung Monastery there were four main tratsang: Gomang, Loseling, Deyang and Ngagpa. These tratsang were property owning corporate entities and included monks who were organized into residential dormitories called Khamtsen.">tratsang</a>?   

**A:**  Yes. Lharamba and tshogrampa took their first test among the common monks because there were many who had to take the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. དགེ་ཤེས] An advanced degree earned by scholar monks.">geshe</a> exam in the same grade. They would debate <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. མཚན་ཉིད] Buddhist dialectics. This is taught after the six-year curriculum called düdra.">tsenyi</a> day after day and make them give the answers. Then the abbot would examine them and say that you are good in <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. དཔེ་ཆ] Religious books/texts, scriptures.">pecha</a>, so you can be Lharampa and say you are not that good in pecha, you have to be the tshogrampa. Then they would be sent to the Dalai Lama for the exam.   

**Q:**  In Mönlam, they gave the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. དགེ་ཤེས] An advanced degree earned by scholar monks.">geshe</a> the number of places, [Tib. ཨང་ཀི] right? What geshe was passed in the Mönlam?   

**Q:**  All the Lharampa from the three great monastic seats would go there. In one year 16 Lharampa would take the exam in the Mönlam in one year. In the 5th lunar month, an order comes from the Dalai Lama telling the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. དགེ་ཤེས] An advanced degree earned by scholar monks.">geshe</a> lharampa to come to <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ནོར་བུ་གླིང་ཁ] The summer palace of the Dalai Lama.">Norbulinga</a> for the examination. At the time of the examination, one geshe sits and the other 15 debate with him in turn and they would corner him severely. On one side the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. མཚན་ཞབས] The religious debating assistants of the Dalai Lama.">Tsenshab</a> would be seated and on the other side the other geshe would sit. In the middle, the geshe who answers the questions, [Tib. དམ་བཅའ་འཇོག་མཁན] would sit. The <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཡོངས་འཛིན] A tutor of a high lama or the Dalai Lama.">Yongdzin</a> are also there. Behind a curtain (its indoors) the Dalai lama sits, we can't see him, but we can sometimes hear the sound of pages turning from behind the curtain. Maybe, he was reading his <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. དཔེ་ཆ] Religious books/texts, scriptures.">pecha</a> to find out the solutions when there were some contradictions in the debate. After this examination, the places of the Lharampa would be set up. The better ones got the places, but the Lharampa who were barely qualified do not get the places.   

**Q:**  They would also have to take the exam on the Mönlam, right? Did they conform the 1st and 2nd place in Mönlam or in <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ནོར་བུ་གླིང་ཁ] The summer palace of the Dalai Lama.">Norbulinga</a>?   

**A:**  The final exam was given in the Mönlam but most probably the places were roughly confirmed in Norbulinga.   

**Q:**  In <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ནོར་བུ་གླིང་ཁ] The summer palace of the Dalai Lama.">Norbulinga</a>, there were two tutors to the Dalai Lama, right?   

**A:**  Yes. The 2 Drepung abbots would come at this time when they were debating.   

**Q:**  Did they debate in the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. chöra (ཆོས་ར)] The walled-in grove in monasteries (monastic colleges) where monks go to study/practice debating.">dharma grove</a>, [Tib. གསུང་ཆོས་ར་བ]?   

**A:**  They debated in the courtyard called khyamra [Tib. ཁྱམ་ར] they did the debating all day and night till about 10-11 p.m. The two Drepung abbots would have to examine very much and they have a great responsibility and make a list of their ranking of who was the first, second and the third places and give it to the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. མཚན་ཞབས] The religious debating assistants of the Dalai Lama.">Tsenshab</a>. The Tsenshab would submit it to the Dalai Lama. He will compare this list with that he had from the examination at <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ནོར་བུ་གླིང་ཁ] The summer palace of the Dalai Lama.">Norbulinga</a> and discuss with the Tsenshab's opinions and confirm the places on the day of the Mönlam exorcism, [Tib. གཏོར་རྒྱག].   

**Q:**  When a new monk joined the monastery and had his tuff of the hair cut in front of the abbot, was this called rabchung, [Tib. རབ་བྱུང]?   

**A:**  Yes.   

**A:**  When you became rabchung, then you become a member of the kyidu.   

**A:**  Yes.   

**Q:**  At this time you didn't have the vow, right?   

**A:**  Yes. You had not yet taken the eight kinds of vows. You only had got the vow in between called barma rabchung [Tib. བར་མ་རབ་ཆུང] vow where you can remain there and or go further up.   

**Q:**  How many years could you stay with the barma rabchung vows? Could you remain there like 10-15 years and then become the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. དགེ་ཚུལ] 1. The novice vows that Buddhist monks and nuns take. 2. A monk who has taken such vows.">getsül</a>?   

**A:**  No, this was not allowed. In <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. སྡེ་ཡངས] One of the colleges in Drepung Monastery.">Deyang</a>, we became monks at age 5-6 or 7. In other <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. གྲྭ་ཚང] A &quot;college&quot; within a monastery, for example, in Drepung Monastery there were four main tratsang: Gomang, Loseling, Deyang and Ngagpa. These tratsang were property owning corporate entities and included monks who were organized into residential dormitories called Khamtsen.">tratsang</a>, they become monks at the age 10-11 or so. When we become monks at the age 7-8, we got the barma <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. རབ་བྱུང] Monastic vows.">rabjung</a> vows, then before you were 20 years of age, you had to take your <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. དགེ་ཚུལ] 1. The novice vows that Buddhist monks and nuns take. 2. A monk who has taken such vows.">getsül</a> vows. Then after you reach 20 years of age you took your <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. དགེ་སློང] A monk who has taken the full set of vows.">gelong</a> vows. In order to stay in the monastery, you must take the gelong vows after you are 20. You are not allowed to stay there without taking the gelong vows. This was not just Deyang custom this was the custom of all the monasteries.   

**Q:**  Could you remain in the monastery as long as you wish after taking the barma rabchung and before taking the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. དགེ་ཚུལ] 1. The novice vows that Buddhist monks and nuns take. 2. A monk who has taken such vows.">getsül</a> vow?   

**A:**  There was not much problem even if you stay there, but it was good for you to not to stay too long because you could avoid committing negativities. If you become a monk at the age 7 you can remain there till the age 15 before taking the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. དགེ་ཚུལ] 1. The novice vows that Buddhist monks and nuns take. 2. A monk who has taken such vows.">getsül</a> vows. Most monks take getsül vows soon after become a monk, but a few in <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. སྡེ་ཡངས] One of the colleges in Drepung Monastery.">Deyang</a> wait till they are about 15.   

**Q:**  Was this a custom of <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. སྡེ་ཡངས] One of the colleges in Drepung Monastery.">Deyang</a>?   

**A:**  No, this was in general.   

**Q:**  I heard that the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ལྡབ་ལྡོབ] A mildly deviant type of fighting or &quot;punk&quot; monk who engaged in fighting and other unusual behaviors for monks in traditional Tibet&#x27;s large monasteries.">dobdo</a> don't have the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. དགེ་སློང] A monk who has taken the full set of vows.">gelong</a> vows?   

**A:**  Dobdo were doing all sorts of rubbish things, [Tib. ཆག་རྡུང་ཉག་རྡུང]. You shouldn't look at them. [laughter].   

**Q:**  Now my next question is how did the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. དགེ་སློང] A monk who has taken the full set of vows.">gelong</a> and the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. དགེ་ཚུལ] 1. The novice vows that Buddhist monks and nuns take. 2. A monk who has taken such vows.">getsül</a> become the monastic officials, <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ལས་སྣེ] The general name for all monastic officials.">lene</a> [Tib. ལས་སྣེ]? The getsül was allowed to become gegö. There were no getsül who was above the age 20, right?   

**A:**  Yes. All of them had to take the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. དགེ་སློང] A monk who has taken the full set of vows.">gelong</a> vow.   

**Q:**  We need to ask again about the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. སྡེ་ཡངས] One of the colleges in Drepung Monastery.">Deyang</a>'s trouble because it is still not clear. Some say that the trouble started when the new and the old <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. དགེ་སྐོས] The main disciplinary official in a monastic college (tratsang).">gegö</a> had an argument when they were handing over the position and the new gegö and the abbot physically fought. Then they were beaten with switches by the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཚོགས་འདུ] 1. The general name for the various types of Tibetan government assemblies. 2. Any assembly, e.g., the assembly (meeting) of monks in a college.">tsondu</a> and the common monks couldn't do anything though they were standing on the gegö side.   

**A:**  What you said now is wrong. The trouble didn't start when the old and new <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. དགེ་སྐོས] The main disciplinary official in a monastic college (tratsang).">gegö</a> were confronting each other. They both were on the side of the common monks. The old one was older and humble in personality and younger one was a person who says "I will get it done" [Tib. ངས་བཏང་གོ] The trouble took place when the old gegö was handing over the position to the new gegö and the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཚོགས་འདུ] 1. The general name for the various types of Tibetan government assemblies. 2. Any assembly, e.g., the assembly (meeting) of monks in a college.">tsondu</a> met on that day. It only meets for 2 days in a year; one in summer and one in winter when the gegö change hands. On the day of the meeting, the common monks rushed up to the tsondu. The two gegö and the common monks had solidarity. The new gegö came to the tsondu only on that day. The old and the new gegö stood up strongly behind the common monks and the new one acted very strongly. The abbot was angry with this and he himself stood up and there were about 7-8 tsondu members with him. This all took place in one day. There were probably 7-8 tsondu members in the meeting that day. That day the abbot got very angry and he rose and came towards the place where the main tsondu members were sitting. This issue had been raised several times before the meeting and the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. གྲྭ་དམངས] An ordinary or common monk.">tramang</a> had asked the abbot about this. On the day of the meeting, the common monks also met in the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཆོས་ར] The special grove (&quot;dharma grove&quot;) in monasteries where monks formally met to practice debating.">chöra</a> and they tried to come upstairs to the tsondu's meeting place.   

**Q:**  Did this happen in one day?   

**A:**  Yes. There was the talk before that, the monks also reported the abbot. On the day of handing over, they beat the monks with switches.   

**Q:**  If you were <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཆོས་མཛད] The title of monks who made a payment or gave gifts to secure exemption from the normal &quot;young monk&quot; work obligations. There were tratsang chöndze and khamtsen chöndze.">chöndze</a>, you couldn't get into the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཚོགས་འདུ] 1.

Any assembly, e.g., the assembly (meeting) of monks in a college.">tsondu</a> unless you became a <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཕྱག་སྦུག] A manager (of estates and endowments) of a monastic college or monastic khamtsen.">chabu</a>, right?   

**A:**  You don't get into the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཚོགས་འདུ] 1. The general name for the various types of Tibetan government assemblies. 2. Any assembly, e.g., the assembly (meeting) of monks in a college.">tsondu</a> by only being a <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཆོས་མཛད] The title of monks who made a payment or gave gifts to secure exemption from the normal &quot;young monk&quot; work obligations. There were tratsang chöndze and khamtsen chöndze.">chöndze</a>; however, if you got appointed the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཕྱག་སྦུག] A manager (of estates and endowments) of a monastic college or monastic khamtsen.">chabu</a>, then you got in the tshondu. You didn't need to become a gegö.   

**Q:**  Did the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཆོས་མཛད] The title of monks who made a payment or gave gifts to secure exemption from the normal &quot;young monk&quot; work obligations. There were tratsang chöndze and khamtsen chöndze.">chöndze</a> and <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. བྱ་ཚུལ] A monastic higher status that was secured by a monk serving 3 teas and 1 thukpa having the thickness of yogurt to the monastic assembly together with giving whatever amount of gye one could afford.

**A:**  The <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཆོས་མཛད] The title of monks who made a payment or gave gifts to secure exemption from the normal &quot;young monk&quot; work obligations. There were tratsang chöndze and khamtsen chöndze.">chöndze</a> and chatsü had to give the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. གཏོང་སྒོ] A monastic obligation to provide the food and other necessary items served at a monastic prayer assembly meeting or some other rite; this was often a required obligation for monastic officials at the end of their term of office.">tonggo</a> of drerampa. This was really like a tax that they didn't have any choice but to give.   

**Q:**  Tell me again about what kind of <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. གཏོང་སྒོ] A monastic obligation to provide the food and other necessary items served at a monastic prayer assembly meeting or some other rite; this was often a required obligation for monastic officials at the end of their term of office.">tonggo</a> the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཆོས་མཛད] The title of monks who made a payment or gave gifts to secure exemption from the normal &quot;young monk&quot; work obligations.

**Q:**  The <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. འབྲས་རམས་པ] A type of lower rank geshe degree.">drerampa</a>'s <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. གཏོང་སྒོ] A monastic obligation to provide the food and other necessary items served at a monastic prayer assembly meeting or some other rite; this was often a required obligation for monastic officials at the end of their term of office.">tonggo</a> was the tonggo to buy out the shöndre. In the past, they had to serve a rice gruel, [Tib. ཐུག་པ་སྤགས་ཚོས་མ] and a <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. གྲྭ་ཇ] The prayer session sponsored by the tratsang (college) at which tea was served to its monks who attended.">traja</a> in the trat<a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. སྲང] A unit of traditional Tibetan currency. It was also called ngüsang [tib. དངུལ་སྲང]. 50 nügsang = 1 dotse; 10 sho = 1 nügsang; 20 5-karma coins = 1 ngüsang. There were also paper currency notes of 7-sang, 25-sang, and 10-sang denominations.">sang</a>. At this time, in the past, there were many people giving <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཆོས་མཛད] The title of monks who made a payment or gave gifts to secure exemption from the normal &quot;young monk&quot; work obligations. There were tratsang chöndze and khamtsen chöndze.">chöndze</a> tonggo because they could avoid gegö. Later, they said the drerampa tonggo should be reduced and they abolished the rule of serving rice gruel and had to pay 1 sang alms as the substitute of the rice gruel and serve one traja.   

**Q:**  Did you make this rule when you were in the monastery?   

**A:**  This was made before <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. དགེ་སྐོས] The main disciplinary official in a monastic college (tratsang).">gegö</a>'s trouble. That's why the trouble arose saying that the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཆོས་མཛད] The title of monks who made a payment or gave gifts to secure exemption from the normal &quot;young monk&quot; work obligations. There were tratsang chöndze and khamtsen chöndze.">chöndze</a> and chatsü didn't need to be gegö by giving a easy tonggo.   

**Q:**  What kind of <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. གཏོང་སྒོ] A monastic obligation to provide the food and other necessary items served at a monastic prayer assembly meeting or some other rite; this was often a required obligation for monastic officials at the end of their term of office.">tonggo</a> would the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཆོས་མཛད] The title of monks who made a payment or gave gifts to secure exemption from the normal &quot;young monk&quot; work obligations. There were tratsang chöndze and khamtsen chöndze.">chöndze</a> give? In the past when doing chöndze, you had to give alms of 3 <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཞོ] A unit in the traditional Tibetan currency system. 10 sho equaled to 1 sang and 10 karma equaled one sho.">sho</a> and a rice porridge that was loose and a traja. Then the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. དགེ་སྐོས] The main disciplinary official in a monastic college (tratsang).">gegö</a> read a letter saying you were a chöndze.   

**Q:**  You didn't need to leave the endowment, [Tib. འཇོག] right?   

**A:**  Yes. Later, they made the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཆོས་མཛད] The title of monks who made a payment or gave gifts to secure exemption from the normal &quot;young monk&quot; work obligations. There were tratsang chöndze and khamtsen chöndze.">chöndze</a> very hard. And in the past, the chatsü was also the same. You had to give alms of 3 <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཞོ] A unit in the traditional Tibetan currency system. 10 sho equaled to 1 sang and 10 karma equaled one sho.">sho</a>, and a rice porridge that was loose, and a <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. གྲྭ་ཇ] The prayer session sponsored by the tratsang (college) at which tea was served to its monks who attended.">traja</a>. It was easy. Both were easy to get. Later, the chöndze had to give an all day long, nyinkhyong, [Tib. ntin 'khyongs] traja with a rice porridge and alms of 1 sang. And then the chatsü was changed to serve: 1 traja (3 teas), 1 rice porridge, alms of 3 sho and 100 <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. རྡོ་ཚད] A currency unit in traditional Tibet that was equal to 50 ngüsang.">dotse</a> endowment to the tratsang.   

**Q:**  When did these begin?   

**A:**  They were before the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. དགེ་སྐོས] The main disciplinary official in a monastic college (tratsang).">gegö</a> trouble.   

**Q:**  Who settled these, the abbot or <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཚོགས་འདུ] 1. The general name for the various types of Tibetan government assemblies. 2. Any assembly, e.g., the assembly (meeting) of monks in a college.">tsondu</a>?   

**A:**  The abbot decided who could do <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཆོས་མཛད] The title of monks who made a payment or gave gifts to secure exemption from the normal &quot;young monk&quot; work obligations. There were tratsang chöndze and khamtsen chöndze.">chöndze</a> and chatsü. If they gave him a gift, he kept half and gave the other half to the tratsang.   

**Q:**  Who made the new change?   

**A:**  This was made by the common monks themselves.   

**Q:**  Who gave the approval or permission, [Tib. ཆོག་མཆན]?   

**A:**  The common monks asked the abbot, but got no formal approval by the abbot or tsondu. But the common monks just announced it though no one gave the order. They did it in a easy way.   

**Q:**  This was during the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. སྟག་བྲག] The regent of Tibet who replaced Reting in 1941 and served until 1950 when the 14th Dalai Lama assumed power.">Taktra</a>, right?   

**A:**  Yes.   

**Q:**  Did the abbot approve these just in name, [Tib. མིང་ཙམ]?   

**A:**  No, he didn't say anything, It was the common monks themselves who used their strength. At this time, the late new <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. དགེ་སྐོས] The main disciplinary official in a monastic college (tratsang).">gegö</a> who was in the same grade with me was also kind of leading the common monks and they went through the motions of suing a law case and discussed this with the kudrak.   

**Q:**  It wasn't the order from the yigtsang, right?   

**A:**  Yes. Probably, the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. སྐུ་དྲག] 1. A member of the lay aristocracy. 2. Title for government lay and monk officials. 3. A name occasionally used for the top leaders/officials in a monastery.">kudrak</a> talked in between. The matter regarding the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཆོས་མཛད] The title of monks who made a payment or gave gifts to secure exemption from the normal &quot;young monk&quot; work obligations. There were tratsang chöndze and khamtsen chöndze.">chöndze</a>, chatsü and <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. འབྲས་རམས་པ] A type of lower rank geshe degree.">drerampa</a> happened almost at the same time.   

**Q:**  Didn't the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཚོགས་འདུ] 1. The general name for the various types of Tibetan government assemblies. 2. Any assembly, e.g., the assembly (meeting) of monks in a college.">tsondu</a> oppose what the common monks said?   

**A:**  No. Later the common monks became very powerful at this time. And later it came to be that whatever the issue; the trsondu had to say that they have to ask the common monks about this.   

**Q:**  Who was the leader of common monk?   

**A:**  My late <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. དགེ་རྒན] 1. Teacher in a school. 2. In monastic settings it also refers to an adult monk who acted as a guardian to a younger monk. In such cases, the younger monk typically lived in the gegen&#x27;s apartment (shag). In monasteries, however, it could also mean a real teacher, or the monk who served as the guarantor for a new monk.">gegen</a> and the main one was an old <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. དགེ་ཤེས] An advanced degree earned by scholar monks.">geshe</a> called Jayang [Tib. འཇམ་དབྱངས] who was a great one. He had done gegö. Later, he was told not to be allowed to sit at the head of 3 people. Before that, the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. གཉེར་ཚང] 1. Storehouse. 2. Steward, person in charge of a storehouse. 3.

These tratsang were property owning corporate entities and included monks who were organized into residential dormitories called Khamtsen.">tratsang</a>, [Tib. སྦུག་འཛིན] and this issue ended up with making the appeal to the government. There was one faction on the side of common monks and another one on Thamba Simkhang, [Tib. དན་འབག་གཟིམ་ཁང] and tratsang side. The common monks won this dispute and Thamba Simkhang's <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. གཞིས་ཀ] A manorial estate.">shiga</a> was taken back and we put our own shidü there. The monks had become very powerful.   

**Q:**  The reason for the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. དགེ་སྐོས] The main disciplinary official in a monastic college (tratsang).">gegö</a>'s dispute was regarding the gegö's <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. གཏོང་སྒོ] A monastic obligation to provide the food and other necessary items served at a monastic prayer assembly meeting or some other rite; this was often a required obligation for monastic officials at the end of their term of office.">tonggo</a>, right?   

**A:**  Yes.   

**Q:**  In the past, what kind of <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. དགེ་སྐོས] The main disciplinary official in a monastic college (tratsang).">gegö</a>'s <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. གཏོང་སྒོ] A monastic obligation to provide the food and other necessary items served at a monastic prayer assembly meeting or some other rite; this was often a required obligation for monastic officials at the end of their term of office.">tonggo</a> did they give? Did they give once or twice?   

**A:**  They gave twice. If the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. དགེ་སྐོས] The main disciplinary official in a monastic college (tratsang).">gegö</a> was for the winter <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཆོས་ར] The special grove (&quot;dharma grove&quot;) in monasteries where monks formally met to practice debating.">chöra</a>, he would become the gegö in the gunchö <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཆེན་མོ] 1.

If he was gegö for the summer chöra, he would become the gegö on the yarchö chemmo, [Tib. དབྱར་ཆོས་ཆེན་མོ]. They gave one <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. གཏོང་སྒོ] A monastic obligation to provide the food and other necessary items served at a monastic prayer assembly meeting or some other rite; this was often a required obligation for monastic officials at the end of their term of office.">tonggo</a> at the end of the yarchö chemmo and one at about the time of Ganden Ngamjö.   

**Q:**  What did they give on the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. གཏོང་སྒོ] A monastic obligation to provide the food and other necessary items served at a monastic prayer assembly meeting or some other rite; this was often a required obligation for monastic officials at the end of their term of office.">tonggo</a>?   

**A:**  They had to give 9 <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. གྲྭ་ཇ] The prayer session sponsored by the tratsang (college) at which tea was served to its monks who attended.">traja</a> for these two <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. གཏོང་སྒོ] A monastic obligation to provide the food and other necessary items served at a monastic prayer assembly meeting or some other rite; this was often a required obligation for monastic officials at the end of their term of office.">tonggo</a>. It was very difficult. For one traja, they served 3 teas; on the two all day tonggo, they served 4 teas for the first <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཚོགས] 1. A prayer assembly meeting in monasteries when all the monks come to an assembly hall and chant prayers together. 2.

But there was also an extra traja called gegö düsang [Tib. དུས་བཟང] given on the day before the gegö's düsang when they propitiates the protective deities, kangso, [Tib. བསྐངས་གསོ]. Then just before he leaves the office, he again propitiate the protective deities and gives a traja. Then there was also a traja given just before the gegö left the office which was called shugcha, [Tib. གཞུག་ཇ] which was the last traja. This makes 9 traja.   

**Q:**  Did you have to do these?   

**A:**  When I was <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. དགེ་སྐོས] The main disciplinary official in a monastic college (tratsang).">gegö</a> I had to do these. The new rule wasn't in effect.[1956].   

**Q:**  How much did it cost you?   

**A:**  At that time, there was an abundant of food stuffs to buy. Now we had to pay 7-8 <a href="#" data-tooltip="[ch. 元] China&#x27;s basic currency unit. A yuan is divided into 100 fen and 10 jiao. It is also known as renminbi or &quot;people&#x27;s currency.&quot;">yuan</a> for a <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. རྒྱ་མ] A unit of weight equal to one jin [ch. 斤] (1.1 lbs).">gyama</a> of butter. At that time, it didn't cost 100 <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. སྲང] A unit of traditional Tibetan currency. It was also called ngüsang [tib. དངུལ་སྲང]. 50 nügsang = 1 dotse; 10 sho = 1 nügsang; 20 5-karma coins = 1 ngüsang.

**Q:**  This new <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. དགེ་སྐོས] The main disciplinary official in a monastic college (tratsang).">gegö</a> rule was it before or after the Chinese came?   

**A:**  At the time of the abbot Dzogchen, the Chinese came. It was after the Chinese arrived before they fired the cannons. I think it was about 1951. I remember seeing a few Chinese.   

**Q:**  When you gave the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. གཏོང་སྒོ] A monastic obligation to provide the food and other necessary items served at a monastic prayer assembly meeting or some other rite; this was often a required obligation for monastic officials at the end of their term of office.">tonggo</a>, was it the old rule or the new one?   

**A:**  It was the old rule. [Note: I think his statement that he did the old system in 1956 is wrong. He must have done in the new system?]   

**Q:**  How old were you when you became the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. དགེ་སྐོས] The main disciplinary official in a monastic college (tratsang).">gegö</a>?   

**A:**  I was 37 years of age.   

**Q:**  When you were <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. དགེ་སྐོས] The main disciplinary official in a monastic college (tratsang).">gegö</a>, had the Dalai Lama gone to China yet?   

**A:**  He had already come back from China. That was in 1956.   

**Q:**  You gave a <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. དགེ་ཤེས] An advanced degree earned by scholar monks.">geshe</a> tonggo, right?   

**A:**  That was on that year when I became the gegö.   

**Q:**  What did you serve for your <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. དགེ་ཤེས] An advanced degree earned by scholar monks.">geshe</a> tonggo?   

**A:**  I gave more than the normal <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. དགེ་ཤེས] An advanced degree earned by scholar monks.">geshe</a>'s tonggo. I served rice gruel. The rice was measured in a <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. བྲེ] A unit of traditional volume measurement [a container] in Tibet, 20 of which typically equaled one khe or bo [also a container], although in some areas there were only 16 dre in one khe.">dre</a> called Jagdre, [Tib. ལྕགས་བྲེ] and I used 115 jagdre.

The traja was normally served in the assembly hall but for the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. དགེ་ཤེས] An advanced degree earned by scholar monks.">geshe</a> exam, damja [Tib. དམ་བཅའ] the person sits for the damja and all the other geshe one by one would debate with him. This was done for both days in the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. སྡེ་ཡངས] One of the colleges in Drepung Monastery.">Deyang</a> Chöra.   

**Q:**  How about the alms?   

**A:**  It was up to you what amount you wanted to give. It was okay even if you didn't give the alms, but there was nobody who didn't give alms. In the 13th Dalai lama's document it says it is all right to give <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. རྩམ་པ] The traditional Tibetan staple food that consists of grain that is roasted (popped), usually in sand, and then ground into a flour.">tsampa</a> soup, but all give rice gruel. For the damja, we used about 12 <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཁལ] A traditional volume measurement used for measuring grain in traditional Tibetan society.

And I hired <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ལྡབ་ལྡོབ] A mildly deviant type of fighting or &quot;punk&quot; monk who engaged in fighting and other unusual behaviors for monks in traditional Tibet&#x27;s large monasteries.">dobdo</a> and that tea was churned and put in kettles.

**A:**  Yes, it started at noon and ended just before the sunset and we debated.   

**Q:**  How much did you give for alms?   

**A:**  I was proud of my alms. At this time, in tra<a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. སྲང] A unit of traditional Tibetan currency. It was also called ngüsang [tib. དངུལ་སྲང]. 50 nügsang = 1 dotse; 10 sho = 1 nügsang; 20 5-karma coins = 1 ngüsang.

It was used by the Chinese government in Tibet in the 1950s because Tibetans did not accept Chinese paper currency.">dayang</a> was plentiful and I gave each monk 1 dayang. I changed Tibetan money [15 sang for 1 dayang] into dayang. This was for <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. གྲྭ་ཚང] A &quot;college&quot; within a monastery, for example, in Drepung Monastery there were four main tratsang: Gomang, Loseling, Deyang and Ngagpa. These tratsang were property owning corporate entities and included monks who were organized into residential dormitories called Khamtsen.">tratsang</a> monks. Then in the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཚོགས་ཆེན] The main assembly hall of a monastery. The assembly hall for the monastery as a whole.">tsogchen</a> I gave 1 sang per monk. I didn't have to do this, but I did. I also gave Hamdong <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཁང་ཚན] A monastic residential unit in which monks from specific geographic areas lived. These were corporate entities with property and internal officials. Some large khamtsen had smaller subordinate units called mi tshan. Khamtsen were part of tratsang (colleges). For example, Hamdong Khamtsen was part of Gomang College in Drepung Monastery.">khamtsen</a> 1 sang for each monk.   

**Q:**  You got this from a sponsor?   

**A:**  I had a rich friend and he said he would lend me as much money as I needed for my <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. དགེ་ཤེས] An advanced degree earned by scholar monks.">geshe</a> tonggo, although I had to pay the interest.   

**Q:**  How much <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. རྡོ་ཚད] A currency unit in traditional Tibet that was equal to 50 ngüsang.">dotse</a> did you borrow all total.   

**A:**  I borrowed 1,300 or 3,000 <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. རྡོ་ཚད] A currency unit in traditional Tibet that was equal to 50 ngüsang.">dotse</a>, I'm not sure. After the revolt, the debt was still there. The Chinese said that we were not allowed to repay it, but I did. I gave my better monk's robe and rug etc to the lender to square the debt thinking that I would commit negativity if I didn't pay the loan.   

**Q:**  When your <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. དགེ་རྒན] 1. Teacher in a school. 2. In monastic settings it also refers to an adult monk who acted as a guardian to a younger monk.

I also took one young gidru of my own.   

**Q:**  How did you manage your livelihood?   

**A:**  Later the two other <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. དགེ་ཕྲུག] 1. Student. 2. Disciple. 3. Commonly the name for monks living with a gegen or teacher. These are more like wards than real disciples.">gidru</a> separated. They are both alive, one is in Sangphu [Tib. གསང་ཕུ] and the other is in Jarag [Tib. སྦྱར་རག]. I was <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. དཔེ་ཆ་བ] A monk studying the monastic philosophical curriculum. A scholar monk.">pechawa</a> so I was not allowed to do tailoring or going to villages since I was a pechawa and I just depended on the alms and the salary.   

**Q:**  What about going to perform rituals?   

**A:**  I was not allowed to do that until I finished <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. དགེ་ཤེས] An advanced degree earned by scholar monks.">geshe</a>. The main source of my income for my geshe tonggo was my family, who was very rich. They gave a lot of things like silver ware and copper ware to the lender to help repay the debt and told the lender to fix the prices. I also gave and sold a lot of my furniture to repay this.   

**Q:**  Could a <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. དཔེ་ཆ་བ] A monk studying the monastic philosophical curriculum. A scholar monk.">pechawa</a> become <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཆོས་མཛད] The title of monks who made a payment or gave gifts to secure exemption from the normal &quot;young monk&quot; work obligations.

**A:**  No. We were not allowed. It was because <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཆོས་མཛད] The title of monks who made a payment or gave gifts to secure exemption from the normal &quot;young monk&quot; work obligations. There were tratsang chöndze and khamtsen chöndze.">chöndze</a> and chatsü have the privilege to not go to <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཚོགས] 1.

The <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. དཔེ་ཆ་བ] A monk studying the monastic philosophical curriculum. A scholar monk.">pechawa</a> always had to go to the tsog chöra, so pechawa didn't become chöndze or chatsü. After one became a pechawa, one was waiting to become geshe. But the pechawa have to do the gegö, which was a tax of tratsang. Since the Geshe gave the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. གཏོང་སྒོ] A monastic obligation to provide the food and other necessary items served at a monastic prayer assembly meeting or some other rite; this was often a required obligation for monastic officials at the end of their term of office.">tonggo</a>, called dreram, to buy out the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. གཞོན་ཁྲལ] The work obligations all young monks have to do for the monastery (it literally means &quot;youth tax&quot;).">shöndre</a>, then they were in the line to become gegö.

When I was a kid, I got 12-13 sang. This was very good for then. During tsongchö, at winter session we got one tranka. On the commemorating days of death of the Dalai Lamas, kunchö, [Tib. སྐུ་མཆོད] then we get one <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཏམ་ཀ་དཀར་པོ] A unit in the traditional Tibetan currency system that was equal to 4 sang. Also a silver coin.">trangga garpo</a> and on the day of the religious procession that takes place on the 30th of the 2nd lunar month, Tsongchö Sebang [Tib. ཚོགས་མཆོད་སེར་འབྲེང] we also get one trangga garpo. These two distributions were given by government. Otherwise at Tsonchö there weren't many sponsors.   

**Q:**  Just before the revolt they printed a coin of 5 <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. སྲང] A unit of traditional Tibetan currency. It was also called ngüsang [tib. དངུལ་སྲང]. 50 nügsang = 1 dotse; 10 sho = 1 nügsang; 20 5-karma coins = 1 ngüsang. There were also paper currency notes of 7-sang, 25-sang, and 10-sang denominations.">sang</a> called Ngatrang, [Tib. ལྔ་ཏྲམ], right?   

**A:**  It looks like the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཏམ་ཀ] A unit in the traditional Tibetan currency system that was equal to 4 sang. Also a silver coin.">trangga</a> garpo.   

**Q:**  Otherwise, what did you get?

For example, a field said to be 10 khe in size meant that 10 khe of seed could be sown on that field.">khe</a> of grain as grain salary, right?   

**A:**  Yes. And from <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. སྤྱི་བསོ] The head managers/stewards of monasteries as a whole, especially the large Gelugpa monasteries like Sera and Drepung.">jiso</a> we got one bo, [Tib. འབོ] which held 10 <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. བྲེ] A unit of traditional volume measurement [a container] in Tibet, 20 of which typically equaled one khe or bo [also a container], although in some areas there were only 16 dre in one khe.">dre</a>, [Tib. ncu 'bo] in summer and one bo which holds 10 dre in winter which was paid to all the monks in Drepung.

**Q:**  Tell me about how the three <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཆོས་ར] The special grove (&quot;dharma grove&quot;) in monasteries where monks formally met to practice debating.">chöra</a> each day were held like the morning session, midday sessions etc?   

**A:**  First at dawn, there was <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. མང་ཇ] The morning tea served to monks from all the monastic colleges at the main prayer assembly hall.">mangja</a> in the tsogchen. After this let out, then the morning session's [Tib. ཞོགས་མཆོད] gong would be beaten from the roof of the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. གྲྭ་ཚང] A &quot;college&quot; within a monastery, for example, in Drepung Monastery there were four main tratsang: Gomang, Loseling, Deyang and Ngagpa.

Then the monks went wearing their cloak for the morning session and sat at the back of the tratsang assembly hall. Then the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. དགེ་སྐོས] The main disciplinary official in a monastic college (tratsang).">gegö</a> went and stood in front of the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཆོས་ར] The special grove (&quot;dharma grove&quot;) in monasteries where monks formally met to practice debating.">chöra</a>'s door wearing his cloak and <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཞྭ་མོ; ch. 戴帽] 1.

Actually the seniority isn't really followed. The gegö's standing there was theoretically to see whether all the monks were there or not, but this wasn't really done. Then after all the monks have entered, the gegö enters. Inside the chöra, they at first didn't sit in their grade, but rather sat all together. The umdze was sitting facing them. Then they started saying prayers and they did the usual prayers. After the prayers, the umdze <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཆེན་མོ] 1.

The <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. དགེ་སྐོས] The main disciplinary official in a monastic college (tratsang).">gegö</a> first would go through the motions of doing his circuit of the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཆོས་ར] The special grove (&quot;dharma grove&quot;) in monasteries where monks formally met to practice debating.">chöra</a> and grade.   

**Q:**  How long would it take?   

**A:**  The whole session including the joint prayers and debates takes only about 1/2 hr because we had to go to traja. The <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. དཔེ་ཆ་བ] A monk studying the monastic philosophical curriculum. A scholar monk.">pechawa</a> would debate until the gong was again beaten from the roof of the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. གྲྭ་ཚང] A &quot;college&quot; within a monastery, for example, in Drepung Monastery there were four main tratsang: Gomang, Loseling, Deyang and Ngagpa.

He was also the servant of the gegö and khempo. It had a middle status of the types of lene. The chabril was also the one responsible for beating the gong at the tsog and chöra.

The butter fat that coagulates on the top of butter-tea when the tea is left to sit for some time.

We then left our boots in the shag and return to the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཆོས་ར] The special grove (&quot;dharma grove&quot;) in monasteries where monks formally met to practice debating.">chöra</a> and again to debate for awhile. We had left our cloak in the chöra. Then when all the pechawa were assembled there, the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. དགེ་སྐོས] The main disciplinary official in a monastic college (tratsang).">gegö</a> would go to the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. འདུ་ཁང] An assembly hall in a monastery.">dukhang</a> and they would follow.

**A:**  They were wearing their cloaks and staying down there and they didn't need to come to the chöra. There would be some of the older <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. བླ་རྒྱུད་པ] A term for the common monks in a monastery (in contrast to the scholar monks who were actively studying the Buddhist doctrine).">lagyüba</a> on the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. སྒོ་མཆོར] The area outside of the monastic assembly hall that is supported by tall pillars.">gomchor</a>, but most hadn't yet come. Then the older lagyüba and <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. དཔེ་ཆ་བ] A monk studying the monastic philosophical curriculum. A scholar monk.">pechawa</a> enter the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. འདུ་ཁང] An assembly hall in a monastery.">dukhang</a> together and the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. གྲྭ་ཇ] The prayer session sponsored by the tratsang (college) at which tea was served to its monks who attended.">traja</a> starts.

It was used politically as, &quot;They put the hat on him,&quot; or &quot;They never took his hat off.&quot;">hat</a>, cloak, and bowls back to our shag. Then there was some time, it was the time for the pechawa to go to the chöra. The pechawa and some lagyüba went to this.   

**Q:**  At this time did they beat the gong?   

**A:**  No gong beating, but some child monks yelled the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཆུ་སྐད] The stylized yelling of young monks from a monastic roof that announces to the monastic community that there will be a distribution of alms in the prayer assembly that day.">chuke</a> [Tib.ཆུ་སྐད] and this was the signal that the midday session, <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཉིན་ཆོས] A mid-day study session in monasteries.">nyinchö</a>, [Tib. ཉིན་ཆོས]. This time we just entered without waiting and sat in one's own grade.   

**Q:**  Could you enter whenever you want to?   

**A:**  Yes. We just went to one's grade. After most of the monks have arrived, the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. དགེ་སྐོས] The main disciplinary official in a monastic college (tratsang).">gegö</a> and umdze arrive. The <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. དཔེ་ཆ་བ] A monk studying the monastic philosophical curriculum.

When all have arrived, the gegö and umdze put on their hats and then the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཆབ་རིལ] The Chabril&#x27;s main work was overseeing serving the traja. He was also the servant of the gegö and khempo. It had a middle status of the types of lene. The chabril was also the one responsible for beating the gong at the tsog and chöra. The chabril got an extra share of gye in the tratsang.">chabril</a> beats the gong. When this was heard, the monks would rearrange themselves into a single group. Then prayers would be chanted, and after this the monks would again rearrange themselves into grade. The pechawa would again start debating in groups of two.   

**Q:**  Did the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. དཔེ་ཆ་བ] A monk studying the monastic philosophical curriculum.

**A:**  The <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. དཔེ་ཆ་བ] A monk studying the monastic philosophical curriculum. A scholar monk.">pechawa</a> sat in the front and the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. བླ་རྒྱུད་པ] A term for the common monks in a monastery (in contrast to the scholar monks who were actively studying the Buddhist doctrine).">lagyüba</a> sit at the behind though they sit in the same grade. Then like before the lagyüba will gradually leave and the pechawa will stay debating. They could stay till dark if they wish. The <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. དགེ་སྐོས] The main disciplinary official in a monastic college (tratsang).">gegö</a> and lagyüba would leave together like I mentioned above. Then after the sun has just about set, from the roof they would again yell the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཆུ་སྐད] The stylized yelling of young monks from a monastic roof that announces to the monastic community that there will be a distribution of alms in the prayer assembly that day.">chuke</a> and the evening ritual, <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. སྐུ་རིམ] A religious prayer service for monks.">kurim</a>, [Tib. སྐུ་རིམ] will start.

The monks file into chöra and sit in their grade and debated. Then when the monks have arrived there, again from the roof the gong was beaten and the monks reassemble into a group. Then they did prayers. Then after the prayers are done, they monks rearrange themselves into grade, and debate in groups of two. Then as before, the lagyüba leave and the pechawa can stay all night debating if they want.   

**Q:**  Usually, as an average, how many monks go to these three <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཆོས་ར] The special grove (&quot;dharma grove&quot;) in monasteries where monks formally met to practice debating.">chöra</a> when you were the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. དགེ་སྐོས] The main disciplinary official in a monastic college (tratsang).">gegö</a>?

So there were about 60. The child monks in the first grade like khatog grammar etc have to go. Including these about 80 go. Basically, only pechawa.
