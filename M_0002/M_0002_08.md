### Tape 8  
**Q:**  Was most of the assembly tea, mangja, [Tib. mang ja] given by government or laji?   

**A:**  Mangja was at first started by the government. Later, they left the endowments, thebtsa, [Tib. thebs rtsa] and the miser would bring butter for the mangja.   

**Q:**  You mean the miser of the shiga, right?   

**A:**  Yes, there were animals like female yaks which were leased to the nomads for which they had to pay fresh butter. Usually, the butter was supplied by the dewashung. In summer the mangja was given by the Drepung Riji, [Tib. ri spyi] for a period. In winter, some were given by Drepung Jiso. But these were just given in between and were not given many times.   

**Q:**  When the dewashung gave the mangja to the tsogchen, the laji was in charge of it, right?   

**Q:**  No, in the rungkhang there was the representative of the government and the mangja was overseen in terms of making it by 2 jama and chatsü deba, [Tib. bya tshul sde pa]. The government probably collected the butter lease from the nomads and then transferred it to the monastery. Tridor la: I heard that they brought the butter from the Phodrang to the tsogchen.   

**Q:**  Do you think that, nowadays it is possible to have geshe like we had in the past? If not, what kind of methods should we take to have that?   

**A:**  It's hard because there are only few monks nowadays. In the past, there was a big assembly and there were betterpechawa than now. So if there were more pechawa, the standard of the learning pecha was also better. To have the monks study pecha well, we need good geshe to teach pecha, but now we don't have geshe who have passed the geshe degree because all the old geshe died and now all the teachers are the better ones from among those geshe candidates who have yet to take the exam. In the past, there were many geshe who got the places, [Tib. ang ki] when they passed the exam and we could select the teachers as we wished.   

**Q:**  Could it be gradually improved in the future like in 5-6-10 years?   

**A:**  It will be hard to have very good geshe. One reason why this will be hard is that in the past, the geshe had to take the exam before the Dalai Lama. Another one is that in the past, they used to study diligently only the five volumes of the main texts, [Tib.gzhung bka' pod lnga] and we weren't permitted to study poetry, [Tib. snyan ngag] history and sumtag [Tib. sum rtags] grammar. If somebody studied those things they would be scolded saying that this will make you get amused in these things. But, now if you can say something about the history, you don't need much practice [in the dharma].   

**Q:**  What happened in the monastery when the revolt took place in 1959? At that time, you were in the monastery, right?   

**A:**  Yes. We had heard several days before that the revolt will arise. We heard from messages that the Khambas were in Norbulinkga and they were doing this and that etc. We were in the monastery at this time. We couldn't go to the war, so we stayed in the monastery and just said to each other what shall we do. Then on the 11th-12nd [Tibetan date] morning before dawn they started firing the cannons. We could see from the monastery the shells flying from Nortölinga [Tib. nor stod gling ga] to the regiment in Norbulinga in the dark of the night. We had never heard this noise before so we got frightened and most of the monks fled from the monastery. Then we got a message in the hills (behind monastery) saying to return, that the tsog and chöra will be continued as before, so one group of monks returned to the monastery. The leaders like the lamas, monastic officials lene, [Tib. las sne] and abbots understood the situation, so they fled and they didn't come back [in another interview said that the tratsang all put their seal on the message telling the monks to return]. We were already on the other side of the hill behind Drepung. So we returned.   

**Q:**  You fled on the 11th night, right?   

**A:**  Not at night, but in the evening of the 11th, we fled when we saw all people were fleeing, but actually, there was no place to flee. After we returned, then one day they said all those with rank or position, [Tib. ming] should stand up. It is okay even if you have a little position. They said that as if they are going to give us something, but instead they imprisoned us. Even the chabril and jama were imprisoned in Phodrang. They didn't keep everyone there in Phodrang for long and they differentiated and higher ones were moved to Loseling.   

**Q:**  Where were you held?   

**A:**  I was held in Phodrang. Deyang was considered not involved in the revolt since our tratsang was humble and we couldn't hold any meetings and act show-offish in the revolt. And we told them that we didn't do anything in the revolt.   

**Q:**  What I heard was that in Norbulinga they fired the cannons on the 11th and the war took place in the Lhasa city on the 12nd and the 13th and took over the Tsulagang and Ramoche. They [PLA] didn't enter the monastery right away and after many days, they entered the monastery. Is that right?   

**A:**  Yes. The soldiers didn't arrive at once in the monastery, but it was not after many days. In between that time, the tsog continued for 1-2 more days, but it was not a normal tsog. There was the traja because the monks have to drink tea.   

**Q:**  What did you think at this time? Did you think that religion would remain as before and you would have the religious freedom?   

**A:**  I supposed, [Tib. cha bzhag pa] that there will be no religious freedom though the Chinese were going through the motions of saying pleasant sounding things that there will be religious freedom, but in our mind, we had high hopes on the foreign countries. I also had hopes on the Khampas, so if these two combined and could over throw our master, [Tib. sbyin bdag] [the Chinese], then there will be some hope that we would become okay, otherwise there was no hope at all, [Tib.sems thag red]. We all were definite and sure, [Tib. thag bcad rkyang byas] about that.   

**Q:**  Some monks said that we thought that maybe the Tibetan government and miser system would be eliminated, but the monastery would remain as before?   

**A:**  Yes, there might be some thinking in that way, but most thought that there might not be, [Tib. yod kyi ma red] tsog and those things in the monastery. Then we had lots of meetings in the Phodrang when we were under arrest and they talked a lot about expelling monks.   

**Q:**  How long did you stay in Phodrang?   

**A:**  I stayed one year. Then they differentiated the monks and they went through the motions of releasing me on 10/1/59, the Chinese National day. From then they held the study session for expelling of monks. They encouraged monks to return to their village to live with family. And they said it's good to go to operates machines, probably they meant driving vehicles or work in the stores, etc. So at this time, most monks left on their own will and went to get the certificate.   

**Q:**  What did you do after you were released?   

**A:**  When I was released from Phodrang, I was put among the ordinary monks and they said I had to go to build the Power Station in Ngachen trhang [Tib. rnga chen 'phrang] so I went to Ngachen and worked there. Oh it was so difficult for me [he had never worked]. After that, they gave us 3 days off on the Spring Festival, [Tib. dpyid ka'i lo gsar]. I then told the monastery officials that I can't do this, so please give me permission to leave the monastery and go home [in the Barkor]. I was afraid that they would next send me far away to another place. I had heard that the communists when they took power would separate parents and children and husband and wife, so I thought it is better to go home then. The leader at this time was a Tibetan cadre who was pretty nice and he gave me the permission to return. He said okay and wrote me the pass and I took my bedding and returned home. Then I was really happy.   

**Q:**  Some people told me that they held the Mönlam Festival in 1960-61. How many times did they hold the Mönlam after 1959?   

**A:**  In 1960 when I was in Lhasa, they held the Mönlam and it was said that all the monks in Lhasa have to go to the Mönlam and I also wore my monk's robe and went through the motions of attending the Mönlam. Then in 1961, maybe they held the Mönlam.   

**Q:**  How many times did you attend the Mönlam?   

**A:**  I went only once, but there were several times.   

**Q:**  Some say twice and some say three times.   

**A:**  Probably, they held three times? There was one when the Panchen Lama came. He went through the motions of giving the places for the geshe exam etc.   

**Q:**  This was in 1962. There was no Mönlam in 1964, 1965 right?   

**A:**  Probably not. But it was not because of the disturbance took place. After that, when they were talking about the separatists shouting slogans and so on, then they didn't hold the Mönlam. I am sure there weren't more than 3 Mönlam.   

**Q:**  This was before the Cultural Revolution, right?   

**A:**  Yes.
