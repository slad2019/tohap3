**Q:**  What is luchey [Tib. བླུ་བྱེད྄]?   

**A:**  This is the money you pay to avoid becoming a <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. དགེ་སྐོས] The main disciplinary official in a monastic college (tratsang).">gegö</span>. This is sometimes paid by the monks who have good reason for not doing gegö or who can't read or who are very poor.   

**Q:**  Even if you are healthy, could you pay the luche?   

**A:**  If you are healthy, it depends on whether the high ups permit you to do so.   

**Q:**  You have to ask the permission to the abbot, right?   

**A:**  Yes. The authority over this rests with the abbot and if the abbot gives the permission, then you pay the money and you don't need to become the gegö.   

**Q:**  In general the abbot gives the permission, right?   

**A:**  He would give the permission only to the poor lagyüpa and monks who do not know how to read because the <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. དགེ་སྐོས] The main disciplinary official in a monastic college (tratsang).">gegö</span> had to read the list of requesting prayers. And they would tell them amount of the money that they have to pay.   

**Q:**  There is no fixed amount of money, right?   

**A:**  Yes.   

**Q:**  They would just offer the money to the <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. གྲྭ་ཚང] A &quot;college&quot; within a monastery, for example, in Drepung Monastery there were four main tratsang: Gomang, Loseling, Deyang and Ngagpa. These tratsang were property owning corporate entities and included monks who were organized into residential dormitories called Khamtsen.">tratsang</span>, right?   

**A:**  Yes.   

**Q:**  As for the <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. དཔེ་ཆ་བ] A monk studying the monastic philosophical curriculum. A scholar monk.">pechawa</span>, what are their monks' obligation or taxes, [Tib. ཤམ་ཐབ་ཀྱི་ཁྲལ]? Did they have to do the <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. གཞོན་ཁྲལ] The work obligations all young monks have to do for the monastery (it literally means &quot;youth tax&quot;).">shöndre</span>?   

**A:**  No. When you buy out, [Tib. བླུ] the <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. གཞོན་ཁྲལ] The work obligations all young monks have to do for the monastery (it literally means &quot;youth tax&quot;).">shöndre</span> then you will reach a grade called tagrik. And then you didn't need to do the shöndre and you will go up gradually in line. When they reach their, some would learn the <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. དཔེ་ཆ] Religious books/texts, scriptures.">pecha</span> and some would not. When the monks are in the 1st three grades in <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. སྡེ་ཡངས] One of the colleges in Drepung Monastery.">Deyang</span>; khatog grammar, düding and <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. བསྡུས་ཆེན] The third class in the düdra monastic curriculum.">düchen</span>, they are not pechawa and they have to do shöndre. At this time, if you buy out the shöndre, then you can choose whether you want be a pechawa or not. The better ones would become pechawa. After this, if you become a pechawa then you didn't have to do shöndre.   

**Q:**  What is the name of the 4th grade?   

**A:**  The 4th grade is called tagrik.   

**Q:**  Then the <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. དགེ་ཤེས] An advanced degree earned by scholar monks.">geshe</span> and the lagyüpa are separated, right?   

**A:**  Yes. Since they became the <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. དཔེ་ཆ་བ] A monk studying the monastic philosophical curriculum. A scholar monk.">pechawa</span>, they were not allowed to miss even one time <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. ཚོགས] 1. A prayer assembly meeting in monasteries when all the monks come to an assembly hall and chant prayers together. 2. An offering made of tsamba, butter and dry cheese in the shape of a cone.">tsog</span> and chöra. Unless there is a special big reason in which case you can ask <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. དགེ་སྐོས] The main disciplinary official in a monastic college (tratsang).">gegö</span> for leave. Then you had to start learning, <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. བློ་རིགས] The last class/level in the düdra monastic curriculum. This is the end of the phase of memorizing texts.">lurik</span> tagrok, namdrel [Tib. རྣམ་འགྲེལ], uma, [Tib. དབུ་མ] pharchin, [Tib. ཕར་ཕྱིན] and dzö [Tib. མཛོད], these are the 6 classes of pechawa. When you reach the dzö, it was time to pass the <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. དགེ་ཤེས] An advanced degree earned by scholar monks.">geshe</span> exam. The 6th class was the hardest period.   

**Q:**  When you become the <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. དཔེ་ཆ་བ] A monk studying the monastic philosophical curriculum. A scholar monk.">pechawa</span>, did you have to go to all the <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. ཆོས་ར] The special grove (&quot;dharma grove&quot;) in monasteries where monks formally met to practice debating.">chöra</span> or is it up your choice?   

**Q:**  You had to attend all the <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. ཆོས་ར] The special grove (&quot;dharma grove&quot;) in monasteries where monks formally met to practice debating.">chöra</span>. At first when you arrive in chöra you do <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. མཚན་ཉིད] Buddhist dialectics. This is taught after the six-year curriculum called düdra.">tsenyi</span> debates before they start the prayers. Then they would beat the gong and all the monks come together and do prayer. Then again there is debating. There are three chöra; in the morning, noon and the afternoon.   

**Q:**  Even though you were <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. དཔེ་ཆ་བ] A monk studying the monastic philosophical curriculum. A scholar monk.">pechawa</span>, you had to do the <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. གཞོན་ཁྲལ] The work obligations all young monks have to do for the monastery (it literally means &quot;youth tax&quot;).">shöndre</span> for three years, right?   

**A:**  Yes, but you can buy out the <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. གཞོན་ཁྲལ] The work obligations all young monks have to do for the monastery (it literally means &quot;youth tax&quot;).">shöndre</span> by giving a <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. གཏོང་སྒོ] A monastic obligation to provide the food and other necessary items served at a monastic prayer assembly meeting or some other rite; this was often a required obligation for monastic officials at the end of their term of office.">tonggo</span>. When you gave the tonggo then you could jump up to the 4th grade takrig.   

**Q:**  Could you buy out the <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. གཞོན་ཁྲལ] The work obligations all young monks have to do for the monastery (it literally means &quot;youth tax&quot;).">shöndre</span> from the grade khatog grammar?   

**A:**  Yes you could and then you could jump up to takrig even though you were a small child and then you didn't need to do the <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. གཞོན་ཁྲལ] The work obligations all young monks have to do for the monastery (it literally means &quot;youth tax&quot;).">shöndre</span>. Even if you are not a <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. དཔེ་ཆ་བ] A monk studying the monastic philosophical curriculum. A scholar monk.">pechawa</span>, since you bought out the shöndre, you didn't need to do the shöndre. If you couldn't give the <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. གཏོང་སྒོ] A monastic obligation to provide the food and other necessary items served at a monastic prayer assembly meeting or some other rite; this was often a required obligation for monastic officials at the end of their term of office.">tonggo</span>, you had to remain in the <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. བསྡུས་ཆེན] The third class in the düdra monastic curriculum.">düchen</span>. But for the <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. བླ་རྒྱུད་པ] A term for the common monks in a monastery (in contrast to the scholar monks who were actively studying the Buddhist doctrine).">lagyüba</span>, you never got admitted into the takrig grade if you didn't give the tonggo you have to remain there doing the shöndre. So there are old monks like this in the düchen grade. As for the pechawa even you didn't give the tonggo, you can go to the takrig grade after the three years. But anyway, after sometime he would have to give the tonggo. There is also the custom that with some boys who are smart and good in learning <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. དཔེ་ཆ] Religious books/texts, scriptures.">pecha</span> that the abbot will pull them out of their lower grade and put them into takrig grade and become pechawa. Then he didn't need to give the tonggo to buy out the shöndre at once but after sometime he would give the tonggo when he reached like namdrel. There were some <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. ལྡབ་ལྡོབ] A mildly deviant type of fighting or &quot;punk&quot; monk who engaged in fighting and other unusual behaviors for monks in traditional Tibet&#x27;s large monasteries.">dobdo</span> who couldn't give the tonggo and also was not smart to learn pecha. They could reach the düchen grade and they would remain there and had to do the shöndre even when they became old.   

**Q:**  Would you please explain about how the abbot would pull up the smart boys to become pechawa.   

**A:**  The <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. དགེ་སྐོས] The main disciplinary official in a monastic college (tratsang).">gegö</span> would usually check the boys and when he found some smart boys, he would request the abbot to have him among the <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. དཔེ་ཆ་བ] A monk studying the monastic philosophical curriculum. A scholar monk.">pechawa</span> and then the abbot would pull him up to the takrig grade.   

**Q:**  What kind of <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. གཏོང་སྒོ] A monastic obligation to provide the food and other necessary items served at a monastic prayer assembly meeting or some other rite; this was often a required obligation for monastic officials at the end of their term of office.">tonggo</span> do they give to buy out the <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. གཞོན་ཁྲལ] The work obligations all young monks have to do for the monastery (it literally means &quot;youth tax&quot;).">shöndre</span>?   

**A:**  It is regarded as hard. You had to give the rice gruel, [Tib. ཐུག་པ་སྤགས་ཚོས་མ] and 1 <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. གྲྭ་ཇ] The prayer session sponsored by the tratsang (college) at which tea was served to its monks who attended.">traja</span> in which we use 5 <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. ཁལ] A traditional volume measurement used for measuring grain in traditional Tibetan society. Sizes of this unit varied somewhat, but the official government khe (called mkhar ru or bstan dzin mkha ru) weighed about 28-31 pounds for barley. It was used to convey the size of fields. For example, a field said to be 10 khe in size meant that 10 khe of seed could be sown on that field.">khe</span> and 16 nyga for one tea and one khe is equal to 7 jin.   

**Q:**  One <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. གྲྭ་ཇ] The prayer session sponsored by the tratsang (college) at which tea was served to its monks who attended.">traja</span> means 3 teas and 1 <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. ཐུག་པ] 1. A porridge or gruel-like soup typically made with tsamba, and if available, meat and cheese. 2. Noodle dishes in broth.">thukpa</span>, right?   

**A:**  Yes. The rice gruel is quite expensive because you have to use more than 20 <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. ཁལ] A traditional volume measurement used for measuring grain in traditional Tibetan society. Sizes of this unit varied somewhat, but the official government khe (called mkhar ru or bstan dzin mkha ru) weighed about 28-31 pounds for barley. It was used to convey the size of fields. For example, a field said to be 10 khe in size meant that 10 khe of seed could be sown on that field.">khe</span> of butter and more than 4 quarters, [Tib. བཞི་གླིང] of a yak meat. This was so hard that later ordinary monks appealed to <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. གཉེར་ཚང] 1. Storehouse. 2. Steward, person in charge of a storehouse. 3. A monastic official in charge of storerooms.">nyertsang</span> to eliminate the rice gruel.   

**Q:**  When did this happen? Was it before the Sera War?   

**A:**  This probably occurred at the time of the disturbance regarding the abbot etc, [Tib. ཟིང་ཆ]. Then they changed the rule of serving rice gruel by giving 1 <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. སྲང] A unit of traditional Tibetan currency. It was also called ngüsang [tib. དངུལ་སྲང]. 50 nügsang = 1 dotse; 10 sho = 1 nügsang; 20 5-karma coins = 1 ngüsang. There were also paper currency notes of 7-sang, 25-sang, and 10-sang denominations.">sang</span> alms to each monk as the substitute of the rice gruel.   

**Q:**  Was there a fixed amount of rice to be used for gruel?   

**A:**  Yes, we use over 100 big <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. བྲེ] A unit of traditional volume measurement [a container] in Tibet, 20 of which typically equaled one khe or bo [also a container], although in some areas there were only 16 dre in one khe.">dre</span> of rice and the cook would come to measure it. After it was decided to pay one <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. སྲང] A unit of traditional Tibetan currency. It was also called ngüsang [tib. དངུལ་སྲང]. 50 nügsang = 1 dotse; 10 sho = 1 nügsang; 20 5-karma coins = 1 ngüsang. There were also paper currency notes of 7-sang, 25-sang, and 10-sang denominations.">sang</span> for the substitute of the rice gruel, it was okay.   

**Q:**  Did you have to give alms to buy out the <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. གཞོན་ཁྲལ] The work obligations all young monks have to do for the monastery (it literally means &quot;youth tax&quot;).">shöndre</span>?   

**A:**  There is no requirement for alms. But most people gave something like 3 <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. ཞོ] A unit in the traditional Tibetan currency system. 10 sho equaled to 1 sang and 10 karma equaled one sho.">sho</span> or 1 tranka.   

**Q:**  After you become a <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. དཔེ་ཆ་བ] A monk studying the monastic philosophical curriculum. A scholar monk.">pechawa</span> did you have to do the <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. དགེ་སྐོས] The main disciplinary official in a monastic college (tratsang).">gegö</span>?   

**A:**  Yes. But you can avoid the <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. དགེ་སྐོས] The main disciplinary official in a monastic college (tratsang).">gegö</span> by buying up the chatsü, [Tib. བྱ་ཚུལ]. For this you don't need to give much <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. གཏོང་སྒོ] A monastic obligation to provide the food and other necessary items served at a monastic prayer assembly meeting or some other rite; this was often a required obligation for monastic officials at the end of their term of office.">tonggo</span> and if you do this, then you don't have to do the gegö and don't have to go to <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. ཚོགས] 1. A prayer assembly meeting in monasteries when all the monks come to an assembly hall and chant prayers together. 2. An offering made of tsamba, butter and dry cheese in the shape of a cone.">tsog</span> and <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. ཆོས་ར] The special grove (&quot;dharma grove&quot;) in monasteries where monks formally met to practice debating.">chöra</span> and can get the alms share from the place near the main gate, <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. སྒོ་མཆོར] The area outside of the monastic assembly hall that is supported by tall pillars.">gomchor</span>, [Tib. སྒོ་མཆོར]. If you give the tonggo for being the <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. ཆོས་མཛད] The title of monks who made a payment or gave gifts to secure exemption from the normal &quot;young monk&quot; work obligations. There were tratsang chöndze and khamtsen chöndze.">chöndze</span>, then you didn't need to go to the tsog and the chöra and you also get the alms share from the gomchor and you also don't need to be the gegö.   

**Q:**  What is the difference between the chatsü and <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. ཆོས་མཛད] The title of monks who made a payment or gave gifts to secure exemption from the normal &quot;young monk&quot; work obligations. There were tratsang chöndze and khamtsen chöndze.">chöndze</span>?   

**A:**  There is a little difference.   

**Q:**  How do they get the chatsü?   

**A:**  If you do the chatsü then you are on the path to the Drepung <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. ཚོགས་ཆེན] The main assembly hall of a monastery. The assembly hall for the monastery as a whole.">tsogchen</span> shengo. If you become the <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. ཆོས་མཛད] The title of monks who made a payment or gave gifts to secure exemption from the normal &quot;young monk&quot; work obligations. There were tratsang chöndze and khamtsen chöndze.">chöndze</span>, you just have the name and don't have to go to <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. ཚོགས] 1. A prayer assembly meeting in monasteries when all the monks come to an assembly hall and chant prayers together. 2. An offering made of tsamba, butter and dry cheese in the shape of a cone.">tsog</span> and <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. ཆོས་ར] The special grove (&quot;dharma grove&quot;) in monasteries where monks formally met to practice debating.">chöra</span>, you can just stay in <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. 1. ཤག, 2. ཞག] 1. The apartment/room of a monk. 2. The butter fat that coagulates on the top of butter-tea when the tea is left to sit for some time. If the tea had been made with a lot of butter, this layer could be thick enough to scoop off and save to later sell or eat separately. The senior monks are usually served tea with a lot of shag.">shag</span>, but you are not eligible for tsogchen shengo.   

**Q:**  How do they get the chatsü and <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. ཆོས་མཛད] The title of monks who made a payment or gave gifts to secure exemption from the normal &quot;young monk&quot; work obligations. There were tratsang chöndze and khamtsen chöndze.">chöndze</span>? Did they have to give <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. གཏོང་སྒོ] A monastic obligation to provide the food and other necessary items served at a monastic prayer assembly meeting or some other rite; this was often a required obligation for monastic officials at the end of their term of office.">tonggo</span>?   

**A:**  If you want to be the chatsü then first you have to request the abbot to give you the chatsü. If you get the permission, then you give 1 <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. གྲྭ་ཇ] The prayer session sponsored by the tratsang (college) at which tea was served to its monks who attended.">traja</span> and a light rice soup called thashi, [Tib. ཐ་ཤི] and you give 3 <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. ཞོ] A unit in the traditional Tibetan currency system. 10 sho equaled to 1 sang and 10 karma equaled one sho.">sho</span> alms.   

**Q:**  You didn't need to leave an endowment, [Tib. འཇོག]?   

**A:**  No. These were done by the cunning people. There were many monks becoming <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. ཆོས་མཛད] The title of monks who made a payment or gave gifts to secure exemption from the normal &quot;young monk&quot; work obligations. There were tratsang chöndze and khamtsen chöndze.">chöndze</span> and there was a trouble in the trat<span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. སྲང] A unit of traditional Tibetan currency. It was also called ngüsang [tib. དངུལ་སྲང]. 50 nügsang = 1 dotse; 10 sho = 1 nügsang; 20 5-karma coins = 1 ngüsang. There were also paper currency notes of 7-sang, 25-sang, and 10-sang denominations.">sang</span>. Later the common monks were on one side and <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. ཚོགས་འདུ] 1. The general name for the various types of Tibetan government assemblies. 2. Any assembly, e.g., the assembly (meeting) of monks in a college.">tsondu</span> members were on the other side and had a fight over this. At that time, it was easy to become a chöndze and many people became chöndze. So they [common monks] said that they are going to make it hard to become the chöndze. Later the <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. གཏོང་སྒོ] A monastic obligation to provide the food and other necessary items served at a monastic prayer assembly meeting or some other rite; this was often a required obligation for monastic officials at the end of their term of office.">tonggo</span> was made harder and the chöndze had to give 3 all-day <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. གྲྭ་ཇ] The prayer session sponsored by the tratsang (college) at which tea was served to its monks who attended.">traja</span> where 3 teas and 1 <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. ཐུག་པ] 1. A porridge or gruel-like soup typically made with tsamba, and if available, meat and cheese. 2. Noodle dishes in broth.">thukpa</span> is served in one day and 1 sang alms. After they made this regulation, only 2 people could become the chöndze.   

**Q:**  Do they need to leave an endowment?   

**A:**  No.   

**Q:**  Did the common monks say that you have to make the <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. ཆོས་མཛད] The title of monks who made a payment or gave gifts to secure exemption from the normal &quot;young monk&quot; work obligations. There were tratsang chöndze and khamtsen chöndze.">chöndze</span> tonggo harder?   

**A:**  Yes. This was the time when the common monks were also complaining about the gegö.   

**Q:**  This happened on the same time, right?   

**A:**  It happened like one after another and then the <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. ཚོགས་འདུ] 1. The general name for the various types of Tibetan government assemblies. 2. Any assembly, e.g., the assembly (meeting) of monks in a college.">tsondu</span> made the document.   

**Q:**  After becoming the <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. དགེ་སྐོས] The main disciplinary official in a monastic college (tratsang).">gegö</span>, do they have the obligation for becoming a monk, [Tib. ཤམ་ཐབ་ཀྱི་ཁྲལ]?   

**A:**  After the <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. དཔེ་ཆ་བ] A monk studying the monastic philosophical curriculum. A scholar monk.">pechawa</span> became <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. དགེ་སྐོས] The main disciplinary official in a monastic college (tratsang).">gegö</span>, they didn't need to go to the <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. ཚོགས] 1. A prayer assembly meeting in monasteries when all the monks come to an assembly hall and chant prayers together. 2. An offering made of tsamba, butter and dry cheese in the shape of a cone.">tsog</span> and the <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. ཆོས་ར] The special grove (&quot;dharma grove&quot;) in monasteries where monks formally met to practice debating.">chöra</span> and they pass the <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. དགེ་ཤེས] An advanced degree earned by scholar monks.">geshe</span> exam. Some even after they became geshe, they would get appointed to be the <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. ཕྱག་སྦུག] A manager (of estates and endowments) of a monastic college or monastic khamtsen.">chabu</span> and cashier if they are very capable. The highest geshe is <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. ལྷ་རམས་པ] A geshe who passed his debate-exam at the Mönlam Prayer Festival. This is the highest type of geshe.">lharamba</span>, [Tib. ལྷ་རམ་པ] if you do this then you are on the road for becoming abbot. The second highest geshe was tsogramba [Tib. ཚོགས་རམས་པ] aimed to be the abbot, then there was <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. ལྷོ་སྤྱི] One of the lower types of geshe whose exam was in the chöra.">lingse</span> dorampa [Tib. གླིང་བསྲེ་མདོ་རམས་པ] which was for those who didn't study <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. དཔེ་ཆ] Religious books/texts, scriptures.">pecha</span> so well.   

**Q:**  If you don't do the <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. དགེ་སྐོས] The main disciplinary official in a monastic college (tratsang).">gegö</span>, could you become the abbot?   

**A:**  There was one person in the past who was good in <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. དཔེ་ཆ] Religious books/texts, scriptures.">pecha</span> and when he was in the lower grades, he appeared to be able to become pechawa, so he was pulled up into <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. རྟགས་རིགས] The next to last class in the düdra monastic curriculum.">tagrik</span> without being able to buy out the <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. གཞོན་ཁྲལ] The work obligations all young monks have to do for the monastery (it literally means &quot;youth tax&quot;).">shöndre</span>. After that, he studied pecha and became geshe. He will not become <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. དགེ་སྐོས] The main disciplinary official in a monastic college (tratsang).">gegö</span> because he didn't buy out the shöndre. Usually, the monks who had bought up the shöndre would become gegö in line. So he was treated specially and made him to buy out the shöndre, [Tib. བླུ་བྱ] because he couldn't give the tonggo.   

**Q:**  I heard that if you don't become the chatsü then you can't be <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. གཉེར་ཚང] 1. Storehouse. 2. Steward, person in charge of a storehouse. 3. A monastic official in charge of storerooms.">nyertsang</span>? There are 2 chatsü every 3 years added to be the replacements if the nyertsang died?   

**A:**  Yes that's right. That used to be the case in past, but just before the revolt, our old abbot who was like a sidhi, [Tib. གྲུབ་ཐོབ] and didn't meddle into politics. He was bullied by the monks and many monks requested him to give them the chatsü rank and he gave lots of chatsü even to some child monks and he broke the rules. In the past, they would make only 2 chatsü once every years which is meant for the substitute of the <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. གཉེར་ཚང] 1. Storehouse. 2. Steward, person in charge of a storehouse. 3. A monastic official in charge of storerooms.">nyertsang</span> and those monk's appearance should be imposing, [Tib. རྫིག་པོ] because they were on the line to become shengo. But during this abbot's time he even gave the chatsü rank to young kids.   

**Q:**  Why did the abbot do this? What was his thinking?   

**A:**  He had the power and he got a lot of gifts from this. And no one could say he was not allowed to do this.   

**Q:**  Then what happened to the monks who were to be the substitutes of the <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. གཉེར་ཚང] 1. Storehouse. 2. Steward, person in charge of a storehouse. 3. A monastic official in charge of storerooms.">nyertsang</span>?   

**A:**  Then the child monks who couldn't become chatsü withdrew from being chatsü and then they picked up the best out of the remaining chatsü and appointed the nyertsang.   

**Q:**  Did you have to be <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. དགེ་སྐོས] The main disciplinary official in a monastic college (tratsang).">gegö</span> in order to become <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. ཕྱག་སྦུག] A manager (of estates and endowments) of a monastic college or monastic khamtsen.">chabu</span>?   

**A:**  Probably, most <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. ཕྱག་སྦུག] A manager (of estates and endowments) of a monastic college or monastic khamtsen.">chabu</span> have done gegö.   

**Q:**  What about if they were <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. ཆོས་མཛད] The title of monks who made a payment or gave gifts to secure exemption from the normal &quot;young monk&quot; work obligations. There were tratsang chöndze and khamtsen chöndze.">chöndze</span>?   

**A:**  If they were <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. ཆོས་མཛད] The title of monks who made a payment or gave gifts to secure exemption from the normal &quot;young monk&quot; work obligations. There were tratsang chöndze and khamtsen chöndze.">chöndze</span> and chatsü, they could become <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. ཕྱག་སྦུག] A manager (of estates and endowments) of a monastic college or monastic khamtsen.">chabu</span> even they hadn't done the <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. དགེ་སྐོས] The main disciplinary official in a monastic college (tratsang).">gegö</span> because chöndze and chatsü are all capable. So their name list was submitted to the protective deity, <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. དན་འབག་ཞང་གོ] The protector deity of Drepung&#x27;s Deyang College.">Thamba Shanggo</span> [Tib. དན་འབག་ཞང་གོ] and the deity would put the seal on the name.   

**Q:**  How did you get into the <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. སྡེ་ཡངས] One of the colleges in Drepung Monastery.">Deyang</span> tsondu?   

**A:**  If you are a <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. དཔེ་ཆ་བ] A monk studying the monastic philosophical curriculum. A scholar monk.">pechawa</span>, after doing the <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. དགེ་སྐོས] The main disciplinary official in a monastic college (tratsang).">gegö</span> you will get into the <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. ཚོགས་འདུ] 1.

A monastic official in charge of storerooms.">nyertsang</span>, you will reach among the tsondu member. There are not many people in the tsondu.   

**Q:**  How many <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. ཚོགས་འདུ] 1. The general name for the various types of Tibetan government assemblies. 2. Any assembly, e.g., the assembly (meeting) of monks in a college.">tsondu</span> members were there?   

**A:**  There were about 50 members.   

**Q:**  Most of them were ex-<span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. དགེ་སྐོས] The main disciplinary official in a monastic college (tratsang).">gegö</span> because the gegö changes once every 6 months, right?

There were tratsang chöndze and khamtsen chöndze.">chöndze</span> and chatsü didn't become <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. དགེ་སྐོས] The main disciplinary official in a monastic college (tratsang).">gegö</span>, but they become <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. གཉེར་ཚང] 1.

**A:**  Yes.   

**Q:**  Did the common monks become <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. དགེ་སྐོས] The main disciplinary official in a monastic college (tratsang).">gegö</span> after they bought out the <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. གཞོན་ཁྲལ] The work obligations all young monks have to do for the monastery (it literally means &quot;youth tax&quot;).">shöndre</span>?   

**A:**  Yes. The <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. བླ་རྒྱུད་པ] A term for the common monks in a monastery (in contrast to the scholar monks who were actively studying the Buddhist doctrine).">lagyüba</span> and the <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. དཔེ་ཆ་བ] A monk studying the monastic philosophical curriculum.

**Q:**  If you didn't buy out the <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. གཞོན་ཁྲལ] The work obligations all young monks have to do for the monastery (it literally means &quot;youth tax&quot;).">shöndre</span>, then you don't need to do the <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. དགེ་སྐོས] The main disciplinary official in a monastic college (tratsang).">gegö</span>. If you give the <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. ཕྱག་སྦུག] A manager (of estates and endowments) of a monastic college or monastic khamtsen.">chabu</span> tonggo when you were young you don't need to be the gegö you don't need to do shöndre.

Any assembly, e.g., the assembly (meeting) of monks in a college.">tsondu</span>?

A monastic official in charge of storerooms.">nyertsang</span> and get into the nyertsang. [Note: It seems the reason why chöndze and chabu skip gegö is that they don't have to wait for it in turn. Rinchen Tharchen didn't get it until he was 37...they can jump into the nyertsang and chabu posts... For chöndze the only way is through chabu.]   

**Q:**  To become <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. གཉེར་ཚང] 1. Storehouse. 2. Steward, person in charge of a storehouse. 3. A monastic official in charge of storerooms.">nyertsang</span> you had to be the chatsü, right?   

**A:**  Yes.   

**Q:**  If you are a <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. ཆོས་མཛད] The title of monks who made a payment or gave gifts to secure exemption from the normal &quot;young monk&quot; work obligations. There were tratsang chöndze and khamtsen chöndze.">chöndze</span>, did you get into the <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. ཚོགས་འདུ] 1. The general name for the various types of Tibetan government assemblies. 2. Any assembly, e.g., the assembly (meeting) of monks in a college.">tsondu</span> without being chatsü?   

**A:**  When you become little older you will become <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. གྲྭ་ཚང] A &quot;college&quot; within a monastery, for example, in Drepung Monastery there were four main tratsang: Gomang, Loseling, Deyang and Ngagpa. These tratsang were property owning corporate entities and included monks who were organized into residential dormitories called Khamtsen.">tratsang</span> chabu and then you get into the tsondu.   

**Q:**  It seems like being a <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. དགེ་སྐོས] The main disciplinary official in a monastic college (tratsang).">gegö</span> is better because you have be the gegö only for 6 months, right?   

**A:**  Yes.   

**Q:**  Sometimes, did the <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. ཆོས་མཛད] The title of monks who made a payment or gave gifts to secure exemption from the normal &quot;young monk&quot; work obligations. There were tratsang chöndze and khamtsen chöndze.">chöndze</span> become <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. དགེ་སྐོས] The main disciplinary official in a monastic college (tratsang).">gegö</span>?   

**A:**  No. If you become the <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. ཕྱག་སྦུག] A manager (of estates and endowments) of a monastic college or monastic khamtsen.">chabu</span> then you get into the <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. ཚོགས་འདུ] 1. The general name for the various types of Tibetan government assemblies. 2. Any assembly, e.g., the assembly (meeting) of monks in a college.">tsondu</span>. And you can't get into the tsondu from the nyertsang. It is only the chatsü who can become the nyertsang. The chatsü comes to the tsondu after they became the nyertsang.   

**Q:**  You become the <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. ཚོགས་འདུ] 1. The general name for the various types of Tibetan government assemblies. 2. Any assembly, e.g., the assembly (meeting) of monks in a college.">tsondu</span> members faster if you go through <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. དགེ་སྐོས] The main disciplinary official in a monastic college (tratsang).">gegö</span> because the gegö's term is only 6 months, right?   

**A:**  Yes.   

**Q:**  What work does the <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. དགེ་སྐོས] The main disciplinary official in a monastic college (tratsang).">gegö</span> do? Is there any work in the <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. ཆོས་ར] The special grove (&quot;dharma grove&quot;) in monasteries where monks formally met to practice debating.">chöra</span>?   

**A:**  Yes. The <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. དགེ་སྐོས] The main disciplinary official in a monastic college (tratsang).">gegö</span> has to go to all the chöra. He checks on whether the monks have come or are absent. Those who don't go to <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. ཚོགས] 1. A prayer assembly meeting in monasteries when all the monks come to an assembly hall and chant prayers together. 2. An offering made of tsamba, butter and dry cheese in the shape of a cone.">tsog</span> chöra have to ask permission from the gegö to be absent.   

**Q:**  In <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. སྡེ་ཡངས] One of the colleges in Drepung Monastery.">Deyang</span>, who had to go to the <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. ཆོས་ར] The special grove (&quot;dharma grove&quot;) in monasteries where monks formally met to practice debating.">chöra</span>? Did all the young monks have to go to the chöra?   

**Q:**  Yes, the monks in the three <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. བསྡུས་གྲྭ] The first curriculum in Buddhist dialectics in Gelugpa monasteries. It is an abbreviated course in logic (tib. ཙེམ [ཚད་མ]). There are 6 classes and monks ideally study one class each year.

Those who gave <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. གཏོང་སྒོ] A monastic obligation to provide the food and other necessary items served at a monastic prayer assembly meeting or some other rite; this was often a required obligation for monastic officials at the end of their term of office.">tonggo</span> to buy out <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. གཞོན་ཁྲལ] The work obligations all young monks have to do for the monastery (it literally means &quot;youth tax&quot;).">shöndre</span> and reached takrig grade had to come to the <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. ཚོགས] 1.

**Q:**  When you were the <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. དགེ་སྐོས] The main disciplinary official in a monastic college (tratsang).">gegö</span>, could you really tell us who was absent?   

**A:**  Yes. That was because there weren't that many <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. དཔེ་ཆ་བ] A monk studying the monastic philosophical curriculum. A scholar monk.">pechawa</span> in the <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. ཚོགས] 1. A prayer assembly meeting in monasteries when all the monks come to an assembly hall and chant prayers together. 2. An offering made of tsamba, butter and dry cheese in the shape of a cone.">tsog</span> even though there were 400 monks in the name list. So the <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. དགེ་སྐོས] The main disciplinary official in a monastic college (tratsang).">gegö</span> will know who was in each grade.   

**Q:**  How many monks would come in the <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. ཆོས་ར] The special grove (&quot;dharma grove&quot;) in monasteries where monks formally met to practice debating.">chöra</span> usually?   

**A:**  In the 6 higher grades like uma, namdrel and pharchin they were all pechawa. There are about 10-11 in each grade in the 6 higher grades. Altogether there were over 50.   

**Q:**  Can you monks wear boots in the <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. ཆོས་ར] The special grove (&quot;dharma grove&quot;) in monasteries where monks formally met to practice debating.">chöra</span>?   

**A:**  Yes you can wear them in <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. ཆོས་ར] The special grove (&quot;dharma grove&quot;) in monasteries where monks formally met to practice debating.">chöra</span>, but in the assembly hall [Tib. འདུ་ཁང] where the <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. གྲྭ་ཇ] The prayer session sponsored by the tratsang (college) at which tea was served to its monks who attended.">traja</span> is served, you were not allowed to wear boots.   

**Q:**  Did the <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. དགེ་སྐོས] The main disciplinary official in a monastic college (tratsang).">gegö</span> have other duties with regard taking exams etc?   

**A:**  Once a year there was a final examination [Tib. རྒྱུག་ཆེན] in summer. At this time, the examiners were the following 4 people: abbots, the umdze, and lama shungnepa, [Tib. བླ་མ་གཞུང་གནས་པ] and the <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. དགེ་སྐོས] The main disciplinary official in a monastic college (tratsang).">gegö</span>. All of those four would come to <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. ཆོས་ར] The special grove (&quot;dharma grove&quot;) in monasteries where monks formally met to practice debating.">chöra</span> when monks take the exam. The lama shungnepa is the highest degree of the <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. དགེ་ཤེས] An advanced degree earned by scholar monks.">geshe</span> which means they all know all the contents of main text. All those who have done gegö didn't have to come for the final exam. Everyone else had to come whether they are <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. དཔེ་ཆ་བ] A monk studying the monastic philosophical curriculum. A scholar monk.">pechawa</span> or not. But the chatsü and <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. ཆོས་མཛད] The title of monks who made a payment or gave gifts to secure exemption from the normal &quot;young monk&quot; work obligations. There were tratsang chöndze and khamtsen chöndze.">chöndze</span> don't have to take the exam. We give these exams all day long and it takes 4-5 days.   

**Q:**  What happens to those who don't know anything? Do you scold or punish them?   

**A:**  People who have to take the exam are given a written notice in which they wrote the names of the texts that they have to memorize in this year to recite in the exam that will be given in the next year. And the exams are all verbal reciting and no writing.   

**Q:**  If they didn't pass the exam would they scold, [Tib. གཤེ་གཤེ] them?   

**A:**  If they didn't pass the exam, we will scold them by saying "later do it well" or something but don't really scold them severely.   

**Q:**  Are there many lagyüpa who didn't give the <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. གཏོང་སྒོ] A monastic obligation to provide the food and other necessary items served at a monastic prayer assembly meeting or some other rite; this was often a required obligation for monastic officials at the end of their term of office.">tonggo</span> to avoid <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. གཞོན་ཁྲལ] The work obligations all young monks have to do for the monastery (it literally means &quot;youth tax&quot;).">shöndre</span>?   

**A:**  There are just a few. The majority had done it. The <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. བླ་རྒྱུད་པ] A term for the common monks in a monastery (in contrast to the scholar monks who were actively studying the Buddhist doctrine).">lagyüba</span> don't study pecha. Some can't even recite the drölma, [Tib. སྒྲོལ་མ] prayer. But they have to go through the motions of taking the exam.   

**Q:**  Even when the <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. བླ་རྒྱུད་པ] A term for the common monks in a monastery (in contrast to the scholar monks who were actively studying the Buddhist doctrine).">lagyüba</span> are 35 or 40 or more years old did they have to go to the <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. ཆོས་ར] The special grove (&quot;dharma grove&quot;) in monasteries where monks formally met to practice debating.">chöra</span>?   

**A:**  Yes. They had to go to the <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. ཆོས་ར] The special grove (&quot;dharma grove&quot;) in monasteries where monks formally met to practice debating.">chöra</span> and <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. ཚོགས] 1. A prayer assembly meeting in monasteries when all the monks come to an assembly hall and chant prayers together. 2. An offering made of tsamba, butter and dry cheese in the shape of a cone.">tsog</span>, but they were treated little bit special and they won't force them much to come.   

**Q:**  What was the name of the book for the <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. གཏོང་སྒོ] A monastic obligation to provide the food and other necessary items served at a monastic prayer assembly meeting or some other rite; this was often a required obligation for monastic officials at the end of their term of office.">tonggo</span> in which it said when there are alms and salary paid?   

**A:**  It was called the "Book of Iron Ox Year" [Tib. ལྕགས་གླང་སྦུག་པའི་དེབ] [It was in 1901.] The <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. དགེ་སྐོས] The main disciplinary official in a monastic college (tratsang).">gegö</span> had to check this book to see whether all the <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. གཏོང་སྒོ] A monastic obligation to provide the food and other necessary items served at a monastic prayer assembly meeting or some other rite; this was often a required obligation for monastic officials at the end of their term of office.">tonggo</span> and the salary were given or not.   

**Q:**  How did you know whether the alms and salary were paid, did you make a daily running list on what day, the <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. གཏོང་སྒོ] A monastic obligation to provide the food and other necessary items served at a monastic prayer assembly meeting or some other rite; this was often a required obligation for monastic officials at the end of their term of office.">tonggo</span> is given?   

**A:**  No, we don't need this. Each time when there is a alms or salary the <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. གཉེར་ཚང] 1. Storehouse. 2. Steward, person in charge of a storehouse. 3. A monastic official in charge of storerooms.">nyertsang</span> or <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. ཕྱག་སྦུག] A manager (of estates and endowments) of a monastic college or monastic khamtsen.">chabu</span> etc will give the <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. དགེ་སྐོས] The main disciplinary official in a monastic college (tratsang).">gegö</span> a list saying on the day after tomorrow, such and such alms from such and such endowment left by so and so sponsors is going to be given or such and such <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. གྲྭ་ཇ] The prayer session sponsored by the tratsang (college) at which tea was served to its monks who attended.">traja</span> by so and so sponsor is going to be served. The gegö would read it in the tsog. These are called list of salary, [Tib. ཕོགས་ཐོ]. We save these and then at the end of 6 months we compare this with the book if something is missing and then we would tell them.   

**Q:**  Who would give the list of the salary?   

**A:**  If the endowment was left with the <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. ཕྱག་སྦུག] A manager (of estates and endowments) of a monastic college or monastic khamtsen.">chabu</span>, the chabu will give the list and if the endowment was left with the <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. གཉེར་ཚང] 1. Storehouse. 2. Steward, person in charge of a storehouse. 3. A monastic official in charge of storerooms.">nyertsang</span>, the nyertsang would give it to the gegö.   

**Q:**  What about <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. གྲྭ་ཚང] A &quot;college&quot; within a monastery, for example, in Drepung Monastery there were four main tratsang: Gomang, Loseling, Deyang and Ngagpa. These tratsang were property owning corporate entities and included monks who were organized into residential dormitories called Khamtsen.">tratsang</span> discipline? What did you experience in your term as <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. དགེ་སྐོས] The main disciplinary official in a monastic college (tratsang).">gegö</span>?   

**A:**  The <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. དགེ་སྐོས] The main disciplinary official in a monastic college (tratsang).">gegö</span> had a lot of power since he holds the jayig of the 13th Dalai Lama with 13 points and I would show off this a lot and I would say, "I am the holder of the 13th Dalai Lama's jayig. If you don't behave well I will teach you a lesson" In my time, there were several fights between some young monks and I caught them and I beat them with thin switches, but I didn't beat them severely and I settled the matters.   

**Q:**  Did you first warn people not to do that?   

**A:**  Yes, we did that and at that time it was called assembly speech, tsogtam [Tib. ཚོགས་གཏམ] or kagyur, [Tib. བཀའ་སྒྱུར]. The <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. དགེ་སྐོས] The main disciplinary official in a monastic college (tratsang).">gegö</span> would say this showing an angry face like a rocky mountain, [Tib. རྫ་རི]. Actually, I was educating them saying you can't do this and that. And I would also say, "didn't you do this? What are you going to do in the future!"   

**Q:**  Did you say specific names in the tsogtam?   

**A:**  Usually, I would say it in general. But if there is a specific person who did that, I will go right where the monk is seated in the <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. ཚོགས] 1. A prayer assembly meeting in monasteries when all the monks come to an assembly hall and chant prayers together. 2. An offering made of tsamba, butter and dry cheese in the shape of a cone.">tsog</span> and I will give him the tsogtam and everyone else will watch him.   

**Q:**  Were those young monks <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. ལྡབ་ལྡོབ] A mildly deviant type of fighting or &quot;punk&quot; monk who engaged in fighting and other unusual behaviors for monks in traditional Tibet&#x27;s large monasteries.">dobdo</span>?   

**A:**  They were like ordinary monks.   

**Q:**  Did they carry knives?   

**A:**  No. Poor thing! [Tib. དམྱལ་བ]   

**Q:**  What else happened during your term of the 6 months <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. དགེ་སྐོས] The main disciplinary official in a monastic college (tratsang).">gegö</span>?   

**A:**  Then there was another fight. This time I made them to make fringes in the place where there were statues like the 8 disciples of the Buddha [Tib. རྒྱན་དྲུག་མཆོག་གཉིས] in the <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. ཆོས་ར] The special grove (&quot;dharma grove&quot;) in monasteries where monks formally met to practice debating.">chöra</span> as the punishment. In <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. སྡེ་ཡངས] One of the colleges in Drepung Monastery.">Deyang</span>, we were not allowed to fine them money which is taken by the <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. དགེ་སྐོས] The main disciplinary official in a monastic college (tratsang).">gegö</span> for himself.   

**Q:**  What happens if there is a theft? Would the <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. དགེ་སྐོས] The main disciplinary official in a monastic college (tratsang).">gegö</span> settle it?   

**A:**  I can settle it and give a beat them with switches and expel them from the monk's order. Even if it is small it is against the rules and it is an expellable crime which is against the religion.   

**Q:**  Do you really read the jayig to see what to do? Or you would you just keep it?   

**A:**  Usually we don't need to read it and it was left there wrapped in <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. ཁ་བཏགས] A Tibetan ceremonial scarf given to lamas, visitors, etc.">khata</span>. It is read every 6 months when the new <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. དགེ་སྐོས] The main disciplinary official in a monastic college (tratsang).">gegö</span> come in. He has to read it in the <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. ཚོགས] 1. A prayer assembly meeting in monasteries when all the monks come to an assembly hall and chant prayers together. 2. An offering made of tsamba, butter and dry cheese in the shape of a cone.">tsog</span> on the day he takes the authority. And he gives a tsogtam. "The jayig is in my hands from now and I will put it into practice." Then they put a khata on it and hang it in the dükhang. The gegö has 3 alms shares. If there was a money salary we get the same 3 extra shares. If there was a grain salary, then we get a little extra share which is a small bo, [Tib. འབོ] which holds 10 <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. བྲེ] A unit of traditional volume measurement [a container] in Tibet, 20 of which typically equaled one khe or bo [also a container], although in some areas there were only 16 dre in one khe.">dre</span> . If there is one <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. ཁལ] A traditional volume measurement used for measuring grain in traditional Tibetan society. Sizes of this unit varied somewhat, but the official government khe (called mkhar ru or bstan dzin mkha ru) weighed about 28-31 pounds for barley. It was used to convey the size of fields. For example, a field said to be 10 khe in size meant that 10 khe of seed could be sown on that field.">khe</span> for monk, then we get 1 khe and 10 dre. This was the source of the income of gegö although was very hard to do.   

**Q:**  Do the <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. དགེ་སྐོས] The main disciplinary official in a monastic college (tratsang).">gegö</span> have the right to get the extra shares called thondabarsum, [Tib. ཐོག་མཐའ་བར་གསུམ] which they had in <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. སྒོ་མང] One of the large colleges in Drepung Monastery.">Gomang</span> where they get three times extra shares from the line when they give alms?   

**A:**  In <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. སྡེ་ཡངས] One of the colleges in Drepung Monastery.">Deyang</span>, we didn't have that. We gave alms in <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. ཚོགས] 1. A prayer assembly meeting in monasteries when all the monks come to an assembly hall and chant prayers together. 2. An offering made of tsamba, butter and dry cheese in the shape of a cone.">tsog</span> while they were seated and didn't give alms in line.   

**Q:**  When they gave the alms to the monks in line and when they reach umdze or the <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. དགེ་སྐོས] The main disciplinary official in a monastic college (tratsang).">gegö</span>, would they give whatever money they have in the left hand as the extra share?   

**A:**  They don't have to give that, but there maybe some people giving them by flattering or because they know some monks. In <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. སྡེ་ཡངས] One of the colleges in Drepung Monastery.">Deyang</span>, the abbot gets 15 shares. This is even for grain salary. He gets 15 <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. ཁལ] A traditional volume measurement used for measuring grain in traditional Tibetan society.

For example, a field said to be 10 khe in size meant that 10 khe of seed could be sown on that field.">khe</span> when the other monk's get one khe.   

**Q:**  Who else gets extra share?   

**A:**  Nyertsang gets 3, <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. ཕྱག་སྦུག] A manager (of estates and endowments) of a monastic college or monastic khamtsen.">chabu</span> gets 3, abbot gets 15, umdze gets 3, <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. བླ་བྲང] 1. The property/wealth owning corporate entity of an incarnate lama. 2.

He was also the servant of the gegö and khempo. It had a middle status of the types of lene. The chabril was also the one responsible for beating the gong at the tsog and chöra. The chabril got an extra share of gye in the tratsang.">chabril</span> and <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. ཇ་མ] The monk(s) in charge of a monastery&#x27;s kitchen.">jama</span> and the caretaker, [Tib. ཇ་ཆབ་བཀོན་གསུམ] also get 3 shares.   

**Q:**  Do the <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. གཉེར་ཚང] 1. Storehouse. 2. Steward, person in charge of a storehouse. 3. A monastic official in charge of storerooms.">nyertsang</span> and <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. ཕྱག་སྦུག] A manager (of estates and endowments) of a monastic college or monastic khamtsen.">chabu</span> also get extra grain salary?   

**A:**  Yes. The <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. གཉེར་ཚང] 1. Storehouse. 2. Steward, person in charge of a storehouse. 3. A monastic official in charge of storerooms.">nyertsang</span>, <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. ཕྱག་སྦུག] A manager (of estates and endowments) of a monastic college or monastic khamtsen.">chabu</span> and the umdze get the extra share just like the gegö. But chabri, <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. ཇ་མ] The monk(s) in charge of a monastery&#x27;s kitchen.">jama</span> don't get extra grain salary.   

**Q:**  Could you expel a monk on your own if he was callous [Tib. རྫབ་ཆེན]?   

**A:**  Yes I had to. There are 4 things for which we expel monks: (1) theft, [Tib. མ་བྱིན་ལེན་པ] (2) killing a person, [Tib. སྲོག་གཅོད་པ] (3) sex with women, [Tib. མི་ཚངས་སྤྱོད] (4) lying, [Tib. རྫུན་སྨྲ་བ]. The last isn't just ordinary lie. It's for big lie. E.g., when some one praise you like saying you are Bodhistawa and Buddha and if you also pretend to be so and say that I became the arhat, [Tib. དགྲ་བཅོམ་པ] and I understand the emptiness, [Tib. སྟོང་ཉིད་རྟོགས], this would become the big lie. Actually, even if some one was going to prostrate to you, you shouldn't accept it.   

**Q:**  When you expel monks, did you have to report the abbot or you could make the decision?   

**A:**  I could decide to expel. I would then inform the abbot that he was expelled and the abbot will erase him from the name list of monks.   

**Q:**  Did you have to discuss with the abbot before that?   

**Q:**  I didn't have to discuss the abbot for the permission. But I didn't have anything like this in my term.   

**Q:**  The <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. དགེ་སྐོས] The main disciplinary official in a monastic college (tratsang).">gegö</span> had a big power, right? Can the monk who was expelled appeal to the abbot?   

**A:**  No. The abbot couldn't say reverse this. If he tried, it would be a big incident and the abbot would be accused of lying.   

**Q:**  Who was in the <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. ཚོགས་འདུ] 1. The general name for the various types of Tibetan government assemblies. 2. Any assembly, e.g., the assembly (meeting) of monks in a college.">tsondu</span> on regular times?   

**A:**  There was no regular base of <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. ཚོགས་འདུ] 1. The general name for the various types of Tibetan government assemblies. 2. Any assembly, e.g., the assembly (meeting) of monks in a college.">tsondu</span> in that name. It was the 4 <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. ཕྱག་སྦུག] A manager (of estates and endowments) of a monastic college or monastic khamtsen.">chabu</span> who meet. The <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. གཉེར་ཚང] 1. Storehouse. 2. Steward, person in charge of a storehouse. 3. A monastic official in charge of storerooms.">nyertsang</span> meet separately for their business. If there was a big issue, the abbot would be approached and he could call a meeting. Then the abbot would tell the <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. དགེ་སྐོས] The main disciplinary official in a monastic college (tratsang).">gegö</span> and the gegö will inform the monks in the <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. ཚོགས] 1. A prayer assembly meeting in monasteries when all the monks come to an assembly hall and chant prayers together. 2. An offering made of tsamba, butter and dry cheese in the shape of a cone.">tsog</span> and they will hold the tsondu gyendzom. Otherwise, they would hold only 2 annual tsondu when the gegö handed over their position.   

**Q:**  What was the difference between the monk's vow called <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. རབ་བྱུང] Monastic vows.">rabjung</span>, [Tib. རབ་བྱུང] and <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. དགེ་ཚུལ] 1. The novice vows that Buddhist monks and nuns take. 2. A monk who has taken such vows.">getsül</span>?   

**A:**  Rabjung was when you become a monk and go to the abbot to ask permission to make this boy a monk. First you went to the abbot and say that I have this <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. དགེ་ཕྲུག] 1. Student. 2. Disciple. 3. Commonly the name for monks living with a gegen or teacher. These are more like wards than real disciples.">gidru</span> that wants to be a monk. I would like to get the permission to make him a monk. The abbot will say yea, and bring him in 2 or 3 days later. On that day you have to bring the gidru early in the morning and before this you shave the gidru's head except for a small tuft. There the abbot will cut the tuft and say from this time on, you have become rabjung.
