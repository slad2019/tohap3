**Q:**  If a <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. དཔེ་ཆ་བ] A monk studying the monastic philosophical curriculum. A scholar monk.">pechawa</a> finished khatog grammar, <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. བསྡུས་འབྲིང] The second class in the düdra monastic curriculum.">düdring</a> and <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. བསྡུས་ཆེན] The third class in the düdra monastic curriculum.">düchen</a> and then reached <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. རྟགས་རིགས] The next to last class in the düdra monastic curriculum.">tagrik</a> and if he was unable to supply the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. གཏོང་སྒོ] A monastic obligation to provide the food and other necessary items served at a monastic prayer assembly meeting or some other rite; this was often a required obligation for monastic officials at the end of their term of office.">tonggo</a> to avoid <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. གཞོན་ཁྲལ] The work obligations all young monks have to do for the monastery (it literally means &quot;youth tax&quot;).">shöndre</a> but continued on studying <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. དཔེ་ཆ] Religious books/texts, scriptures.">pecha</a> eventually did he have to give the money to buy out the shöndre?   

**A:**  If a <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. དཔེ་ཆ་བ] A monk studying the monastic philosophical curriculum. A scholar monk.">pechawa</a> continued on without supplying the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. གཏོང་སྒོ] A monastic obligation to provide the food and other necessary items served at a monastic prayer assembly meeting or some other rite; this was often a required obligation for monastic officials at the end of their term of office.">tonggo</a> to avoid the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. གཞོན་ཁྲལ] The work obligations all young monks have to do for the monastery (it literally means &quot;youth tax&quot;).">shöndre</a> and got promoted in the grades and reach the level of being ready to do his <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. དགེ་ཤེས] An advanced degree earned by scholar monks.">geshe</a> tonggo, then there would be a discussion about this earlier omission and they would ask you to buy out, lucha, [Tib. བླུ་བྱ] the shöndre. It won't be too big.   

**Q:**  Then did he have to do the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. དགེ་སྐོས] The main disciplinary official in a monastic college (tratsang).">gegö</a>?   

**A:**  He won't have to do the gegö. After paying the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. གཞོན་ཁྲལ] The work obligations all young monks have to do for the monastery (it literally means &quot;youth tax&quot;).">shöndre</a> lucha, he would give the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. དགེ་ཤེས] An advanced degree earned by scholar monks.">geshe</a> <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. གཏོང་སྒོ] A monastic obligation to provide the food and other necessary items served at a monastic prayer assembly meeting or some other rite; this was often a required obligation for monastic officials at the end of their term of office.">tonggo</a>. Only those who gave the tonggo for the shöndre had to do the gegö. He would now be way up in the grade system, so he didn't have to give the tonggo and the reason he got this far was that he was a pechawa. There were several kinds of geshe. The highest was lharampa, the 2nd was tsogramba, [Tib. ཚོགས་རམས་པ] the 3rd was <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ལྷོ་སྤྱི] One of the lower types of geshe whose exam was in the chöra.">lingse</a>, [Tib. གླིང་བསྲེ] and 4th was dorampa, [Tib. མདོ་རམས་པ]. Lingse and dorampa were about the same. The abbot usually did examination of the candidates who were at each geshe level. The abbot would distinguish between those who would do lharampa and tsogrampa. Everyone couldn't go for this at once. So each year, if there were 10 who were of lharampa quality, the abbot would draw lots to see who were the 2 or 3 or so who would be able to actually do it in this year. Similarly the tsogrampa would also be chosen through drawing lots. There was no way of backing, [Tib. འགོ་འདྲེན] to get this since all the people can evaluate ones level of knowledge themselves.   

**Q:**  After one gave the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. དགེ་ཤེས] An advanced degree earned by scholar monks.">geshe</a> tonggo, were they allowed to go in the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཚོགས་འདུ] 1. The general name for the various types of Tibetan government assemblies. 2. Any assembly, e.g., the assembly (meeting) of monks in a college.">tsondu</a>?   

**A:**  Not right away. Unless they did the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. དགེ་སྐོས] The main disciplinary official in a monastic college (tratsang).">gegö</a>, they couldn't get into the tsondu. Some who had given <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. དགེ་ཤེས] An advanced degree earned by scholar monks.">geshe</a> <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. གཏོང་སྒོ] A monastic obligation to provide the food and other necessary items served at a monastic prayer assembly meeting or some other rite; this was often a required obligation for monastic officials at the end of their term of office.">tonggo</a> had to wait for a quite a long time to become the gegö. Some who were good in <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. དཔེ་ཆ] Religious books/texts, scriptures.">pecha</a> became geshe first and then became the gegö. Some gave the tonggo to buy out <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. གཞོན་ཁྲལ] The work obligations all young monks have to do for the monastery (it literally means &quot;youth tax&quot;).">shöndre</a> early and became gegö before becoming the geshe.   

**Q:**  Anyway, if the lharampa had paid the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. གཞོན་ཁྲལ] The work obligations all young monks have to do for the monastery (it literally means &quot;youth tax&quot;).">shöndre</a> lucha, he didn't have to be the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. དགེ་སྐོས] The main disciplinary official in a monastic college (tratsang).">gegö</a>?   

**A:**  Since he had given the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. གཏོང་སྒོ] A monastic obligation to provide the food and other necessary items served at a monastic prayer assembly meeting or some other rite; this was often a required obligation for monastic officials at the end of their term of office.">tonggo</a> to buy out <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. གཞོན་ཁྲལ] The work obligations all young monks have to do for the monastery (it literally means &quot;youth tax&quot;).">shöndre</a>, he would be among the line to be the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. དགེ་སྐོས] The main disciplinary official in a monastic college (tratsang).">gegö</a> sooner or later. But if a <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. དགེ་ཤེས] An advanced degree earned by scholar monks.">geshe</a> paid the shöndre lucha, then he didn't need to be the gegö.   

**Q:**  How much was the lucha? Was there a difference in the amount of money between the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. གཞོན་ཁྲལ] The work obligations all young monks have to do for the monastery (it literally means &quot;youth tax&quot;).">shöndre</a> lucha and the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. གཏོང་སྒོ] A monastic obligation to provide the food and other necessary items served at a monastic prayer assembly meeting or some other rite; this was often a required obligation for monastic officials at the end of their term of office.">tonggo</a> to buy out the shöndre?   

**A:**  The <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. གཞོན་ཁྲལ] The work obligations all young monks have to do for the monastery (it literally means &quot;youth tax&quot;).">shöndre</a> lucha depends on what the abbot says to give and you don't need to serve the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. གྲྭ་ཇ] The prayer session sponsored by the tratsang (college) at which tea was served to its monks who attended.">traja</a> and money wasn't that much.   

**Q:**  When you were small, your father gave the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. གཏོང་སྒོ] A monastic obligation to provide the food and other necessary items served at a monastic prayer assembly meeting or some other rite; this was often a required obligation for monastic officials at the end of their term of office.">tonggo</a> to buy out the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. གཞོན་ཁྲལ] The work obligations all young monks have to do for the monastery (it literally means &quot;youth tax&quot;).">shöndre</a>, right?   

**A:**  Yes. I became the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. དགེ་སྐོས] The main disciplinary official in a monastic college (tratsang).">gegö</a> in summer when I was 37 years old and I also became the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. དགེ་ཤེས] An advanced degree earned by scholar monks.">geshe</a> in the winter of the same year. I had to be the gegö first because I had given the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. གཏོང་སྒོ] A monastic obligation to provide the food and other necessary items served at a monastic prayer assembly meeting or some other rite; this was often a required obligation for monastic officials at the end of their term of office.">tonggo</a> to buy out the shöndre.   

**Q:**  For <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. བླ་རྒྱུད་པ] A term for the common monks in a monastery (in contrast to the scholar monks who were actively studying the Buddhist doctrine).">lagyüba</a>, if they hadn't given the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. གཏོང་སྒོ] A monastic obligation to provide the food and other necessary items served at a monastic prayer assembly meeting or some other rite; this was often a required obligation for monastic officials at the end of their term of office.">tonggo</a> to buy out the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. གཞོན་ཁྲལ] The work obligations all young monks have to do for the monastery (it literally means &quot;youth tax&quot;).">shöndre</a>, they didn't become the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. དགེ་སྐོས] The main disciplinary official in a monastic college (tratsang).">gegö</a>, right?   

**A:**  Yes. They stayed in the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. བསྡུས་ཆེན] The third class in the düdra monastic curriculum.">düchen</a> and didn't go to the higher grades like <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. རྟགས་རིགས] The next to last class in the düdra monastic curriculum.">tagrik</a>. If they supplied the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. གཏོང་སྒོ] A monastic obligation to provide the food and other necessary items served at a monastic prayer assembly meeting or some other rite; this was often a required obligation for monastic officials at the end of their term of office.">tonggo</a> to buy out <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. གཞོན་ཁྲལ] The work obligations all young monks have to do for the monastery (it literally means &quot;youth tax&quot;).">shöndre</a> then they got promoted in the grades like tagrik and were in the line up for the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. དགེ་སྐོས] The main disciplinary official in a monastic college (tratsang).">gegö</a> where there were both the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. དཔེ་ཆ་བ] A monk studying the monastic philosophical curriculum. A scholar monk.">pechawa</a> and lagyüba. Even if one was a small monk, if he gave the tonggo to buy out the shöndre, he would reach the tagrik at once and he would be in the line to become the gegö.   

**Q:**  But in the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཆོས་ར] The special grove (&quot;dharma grove&quot;) in monasteries where monks formally met to practice debating.">chöra</a>, did they get promoted in the grades?   

**A:**  They would be promoted in grades even if he was a <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. བླ་རྒྱུད་པ] A term for the common monks in a monastery (in contrast to the scholar monks who were actively studying the Buddhist doctrine).">lagyüba</a>, but then slowly get promoted to the grades like uma etc. The <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. དཔེ་ཆ་བ] A monk studying the monastic philosophical curriculum. A scholar monk.">pechawa</a> would get promoted in groups to the higher grades to be in the line for becoming geshe.   

**Q:**  Sometimes, did the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. དཔེ་ཆ་བ] A monk studying the monastic philosophical curriculum. A scholar monk.">pechawa</a> have to stay in the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. རྟགས་རིགས] The next to last class in the düdra monastic curriculum.">tagrik</a> for 2-3 years?   

**A:**  If the former one was getting promoted, then the latter would follow him up.   

**Q:**  Was there a limit time for them to get promoted?   

**A:**  No. In the highest grade dzö, [Tib. མཛོད], if there were about 11-12-15 monks, the abbot would give an exam [Tib.རྒྱུགས་ལེན] once a year in the chöra. And the abbot would divide the grade into 3 categories: lharampa, tsogrampa, dorampa and lingse. Then the abbot would draw lottery and would say this year you 2 go for <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ལྷ་རམས་པ] A geshe who passed his debate-exam at the Mönlam Prayer Festival. This is the highest type of geshe.">lharamba</a>, next year you two etc. He would do this for each of these grades of monks in the dzö. When the dzö grade was almost finished, then they would promote the grades below into dzö.   

**Q:**  Were they allowed to have 3 lharampa and the 3 tsogrampa in one year?   

**A:**  Yes, there were like 2 lharampa and 2-3 tsogrampa, but since in the small <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. གྲྭ་ཚང] A &quot;college&quot; within a monastery, for example, in Drepung Monastery there were four main tratsang: Gomang, Loseling, Deyang and Ngagpa. These tratsang were property owning corporate entities and included monks who were organized into residential dormitories called Khamtsen.">tratsang</a>, this would happen just a few times. In <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. སྡེ་ཡངས] One of the colleges in Drepung Monastery.">Deyang</a>, in one year at the most, there would be 3 lharampa and 2 tsogramba. In the larger tratsang, there would be 4-5 lharampa a year.   

**Q:**  They remained in the dzö for 2-3 years, right?   

**A:**  Yes because this was the highest grade and they had to remain there till they pass the geshe.   

**Q:**  The <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. བླ་རྒྱུད་པ] A term for the common monks in a monastery (in contrast to the scholar monks who were actively studying the Buddhist doctrine).">lagyüba</a> would not get promoted in those grades?   

**A:**  After that, when some <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. བླ་རྒྱུད་པ] A term for the common monks in a monastery (in contrast to the scholar monks who were actively studying the Buddhist doctrine).">lagyüba</a> became the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. དགེ་སྐོས] The main disciplinary official in a monastic college (tratsang).">gegö</a>, then they would promote some lagyüba in the grades.   

**Q:**  Did they reach dzö?   

**A:**  Yes, they did, but they didn't need to learn the pecha.   

**Q:**  So they couldn't become lharampa and tsogrampa, right?   

**A:**  Yes, dzö and uma were names of the pecha.   

**Q:**  I heard in <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. སྒོ་མང] One of the large colleges in Drepung Monastery.">Gomang</a>, the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. བླ་རྒྱུད་པ] A term for the common monks in a monastery (in contrast to the scholar monks who were actively studying the Buddhist doctrine).">lagyüba</a> did prayers in <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཆོས་ར] The special grove (&quot;dharma grove&quot;) in monasteries where monks formally met to practice debating.">chöra</a> and then left before the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. དཔེ་ཆ་བ] A monk studying the monastic philosophical curriculum. A scholar monk.">pechawa</a> came and debated tsenyi.   

**A:**  In <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. སྒོ་མང] One of the large colleges in Drepung Monastery.">Gomang</a>, there were some who had a good voice called kesang, [Tib. སྐད་བཟང]. And there were some <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. དཔེ་ཆ་བ] A monk studying the monastic philosophical curriculum. A scholar monk.">pechawa</a> joining the kesang and after that, the pechawa stayed there debating <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. མཚན་ཉིད] Buddhist dialectics. This is taught after the six-year curriculum called düdra.">tsenyi</a> and the kesang left the chöra. In <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. སྡེ་ཡངས] One of the colleges in Drepung Monastery.">Deyang</a>, we had a few sungsang, [Tib.གསུང་བཟང] who were specialists in prayers, but there were not many people. They were <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. བླ་རྒྱུད་པ] A term for the common monks in a monastery (in contrast to the scholar monks who were actively studying the Buddhist doctrine).">lagyüba</a> but they had the same special privilege as pechawa in not having to do shöndre. But, if there were 5 lagyüba and 5 pechawa and if there was some work to be done in the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. གྲྭ་ཚང] A &quot;college&quot; within a monastery, for example, in Drepung Monastery there were four main tratsang: Gomang, Loseling, Deyang and Ngagpa. These tratsang were property owning corporate entities and included monks who were organized into residential dormitories called Khamtsen.">tratsang</a>, then the lagyüba had to do it and if there was a sungsang among the lagyüba, he did not have to do the work.   

**Q:**  Did <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. བླ་རྒྱུད་པ] A term for the common monks in a monastery (in contrast to the scholar monks who were actively studying the Buddhist doctrine).">lagyüba</a> have to go to the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཚོགས] 1. A prayer assembly meeting in monasteries when all the monks come to an assembly hall and chant prayers together. 2. An offering made of tsamba, butter and dry cheese in the shape of a cone.">tsog</a> and <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཆོས་ར] The special grove (&quot;dharma grove&quot;) in monasteries where monks formally met to practice debating.">chöra</a> when they reached dzö?   

**A:**  They had to go unless they had done <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. དགེ་སྐོས] The main disciplinary official in a monastic college (tratsang).">gegö</a>, but the gegö didn't push them much if they didn't go. If the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. དཔེ་ཆ་བ] A monk studying the monastic philosophical curriculum. A scholar monk.">pechawa</a> didn't go, we scolded them as it's not okay.   

**Q:**  What about the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ལྡབ་ལྡོབ] A mildly deviant type of fighting or &quot;punk&quot; monk who engaged in fighting and other unusual behaviors for monks in traditional Tibet&#x27;s large monasteries.">dobdo</a>?   

**A:**  The <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ལྡབ་ལྡོབ] A mildly deviant type of fighting or &quot;punk&quot; monk who engaged in fighting and other unusual behaviors for monks in traditional Tibet&#x27;s large monasteries.">dobdo</a> mostly didn't come. They had to remain in the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. བསྡུས་ཆེན] The third class in the düdra monastic curriculum.">düchen</a> and mostly just wandered around without going to <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཚོགས] 1. A prayer assembly meeting in monasteries when all the monks come to an assembly hall and chant prayers together. 2. An offering made of tsamba, butter and dry cheese in the shape of a cone.">tsog</a> or <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཆོས་ར] The special grove (&quot;dharma grove&quot;) in monasteries where monks formally met to practice debating.">chöra</a> and they had some special privileges.   

**Q:**  At the time of the gyugchen, the final exam did <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. བླ་རྒྱུད་པ] A term for the common monks in a monastery (in contrast to the scholar monks who were actively studying the Buddhist doctrine).">lagyüba</a> and <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. དཔེ་ཆ་བ] A monk studying the monastic philosophical curriculum. A scholar monk.">pechawa</a> have to come?   

**A:**  Yes, all of them would go through the motions of taking the exam. The <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. བླ་རྒྱུད་པ] A term for the common monks in a monastery (in contrast to the scholar monks who were actively studying the Buddhist doctrine).">lagyüba</a> didn't have much to take the test. But 3-4 lagyüba take the test together. If one was better at doing daily prayers, khandön [Tib. ཁ་འདོན] like the eight kind of prayers called, Monlam Namgye, [Tib. སྨོན་ལམ་རྣམ་བརྒྱད] then he started the prayers and the others just made some noises and it was okay.   

**Q:**  The monastic officials, <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ལས་སྣེ] The general name for all monastic officials.">lene</a>, [Tib. ལས་སྣེ] didn't go, right??   

**A:**  Yes. Chöndze, chatsü, and others with special privilege such as <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. དགེ་སྐོས] The main disciplinary official in a monastic college (tratsang).">gegö</a>, <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. གཉེར་ཚང] 1. Storehouse. 2. Steward, person in charge of a storehouse. 3. A monastic official in charge of storerooms.">nyertsang</a>, <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཕྱག་སྦུག] A manager (of estates and endowments) of a monastic college or monastic khamtsen.">chabu</a> and all who had the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཐོན] In monasteries, a title for monks who have finished their monastic job obligations (tib. ཐོན་ཟིན).">thön</a> like the ex-gegö did not have to take the test.   

**Q:**  Did the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. དགེ་ཤེས] An advanced degree earned by scholar monks.">geshe</a> have to take the test?   

**A:**  After they have passed the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. དགེ་ཤེས] An advanced degree earned by scholar monks.">geshe</a>, they didn't have to come even though they had not yet done the gegö. At that time, they would take the real exam for the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. དཔེ་ཆ་བ] A monk studying the monastic philosophical curriculum. A scholar monk.">pechawa</a> in very detailed and thoroughly involving the main texts, [Tib. རྩ་བ] of five <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. མཚན་ཉིད] Buddhist dialectics. This is taught after the six-year curriculum called düdra.">tsenyi</a> texts, <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. གཞུང] 1. A government. 2. The government of the Dalai Lama.">shung</a> kabönga. [Tib. gzhung bka' spod lnag]. Even the small child monks, inchung, [Tib. ཨིན་ཆུང] who had a good memory would be asked to take the test on the prayers called Chöjö Rabsel which is the prayer recited to the general assembly. Except the geshe and the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. གྲྭ་ཚང] A &quot;college&quot; within a monastery, for example, in Drepung Monastery there were four main tratsang: Gomang, Loseling, Deyang and Ngagpa. These tratsang were property owning corporate entities and included monks who were organized into residential dormitories called Khamtsen.">tratsang</a> nene who had the special privileges, all of the monks had to take the test.   

**Q:**  The <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. སྒོ་མང] One of the large colleges in Drepung Monastery.">Gomang</a> had a trouble saying that the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. དཔེ་ཆ་བ] A monk studying the monastic philosophical curriculum. A scholar monk.">pechawa</a> were difficult and the Dalai Lama gave them 3,000-4,000-5,000 dotse. Did something similar happen in <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. སྡེ་ཡངས] One of the colleges in Drepung Monastery.">Deyang</a>?   

**A:**  No.   

**Q:**  Did the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. དཔེ་ཆ་བ] A monk studying the monastic philosophical curriculum. A scholar monk.">pechawa</a> in <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. སྡེ་ཡངས] One of the colleges in Drepung Monastery.">Deyang</a> have kind of special privilege?   

**A:**  No. We didn't have any additional money or salary for the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. དཔེ་ཆ་བ] A monk studying the monastic philosophical curriculum. A scholar monk.">pechawa</a> and nobody claimed for that.   

**Q:**  In the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཚོགས་འདུ] 1. The general name for the various types of Tibetan government assemblies. 2. Any assembly, e.g., the assembly (meeting) of monks in a college.">tsondu</a>, how did people sit and what did they eat, etc.?   

**A:**  Tsondu's seating arrangement is: The abbot had a high throne. Under that the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. དགེ་སྐོས] The main disciplinary official in a monastic college (tratsang).">gegö</a> and the umdze sat on a little higher cushion. Under that on one side, the ex-geg would sit. On the other side the 4 <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཕྱག་སྦུག] A manager (of estates and endowments) of a monastic college or monastic khamtsen.">chabu</a> and two <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. གཉེར་ཚང] 1. Storehouse. 2. Steward, person in charge of a storehouse. 3. A monastic official in charge of storerooms.">nyertsang</a> would sit. Under that, the ex-chabu, <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཐོན་ཟིན] The ex-monastic officials who had the title of &quot;thon&quot; by virtue of having completed their monastic job obligations.">thönsin</a>, [Tib. ཐོན་ཟིན] would sit. In the middle row, the ex-nyertsang would sit. The ex-chatsü or the ex-nyertsang had already become the nyertsang and although they were to become the candidates, but they didn't get the shengo and became the ex-nyertsang and they still remain the tsondu. Abbot gegö umdze nyertsang nyertsang ex-gegö ex-nyertsang chabu ex-gegö ex-nyertsang chabu ex-gegö ex-nyertsang chabu ex-gegö ex-nyertsang chabu   

**Q:**  Under this where would the ex-chabu sit?

**A:**  There was not much food and in the beginning they serve tea. Then they put <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. རྩམ་པ] The traditional Tibetan staple food that consists of grain that is roasted (popped), usually in heated sand, and then ground into a flour.">tsamba</a> bags there, so we could eat as much as we wanted. In the evening there is a meal called Sötsig Chemo [Tib. གསོལ་ཚིགས་ཆེན་མོ] where they serve boiled mutton, radish and pag.   

**Q:**  Was the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཚོགས་འདུ] 1. The general name for the various types of Tibetan government assemblies. 2. Any assembly, e.g., the assembly (meeting) of monks in a college.">tsondu</a> all day long?   

**A:**  Yes. But if the work was over we end the tsondu.   

**Q:**  You had experienced the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཚོགས་འདུ] 1. The general name for the various types of Tibetan government assemblies. 2. Any assembly, e.g., the assembly (meeting) of monks in a college.">tsondu</a> twice when you became the gegö. What did they mainly talk about at the tsondu?   

**A:**  First there was the change in the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. དགེ་སྐོས] The main disciplinary official in a monastic college (tratsang).">gegö</a>. The ex-gegö at first would be waiting outside. This was because the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཚོགས་འདུ] 1. The general name for the various types of Tibetan government assemblies. 2. Any assembly, e.g., the assembly (meeting) of monks in a college.">tsondu</a> discusses the work of the gegö over the past six months. If it concludes he did well we give a <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཁ་བཏགས] A Tibetan ceremonial scarf given to lamas, visitors, etc.">khata</a> ashe [Tib. ཨ་ཤེ] and if not we give a middle or inferior khata. When this was settled then the gegö was invited to the tsondu and the khata was put on him while he stands and bent over. Otherwise, the things were not said in words. Then he was now ex-gegö and takes his place at the end of the line of ex-gegö. Then the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཚོགས] 1. A prayer assembly meeting in monasteries when all the monks come to an assembly hall and chant prayers together. 2. An offering made of tsamba, butter and dry cheese in the shape of a cone.">tsog</a> for the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. གྲྭ་ཇ] The prayer session sponsored by the tratsang (college) at which tea was served to its monks who attended.">traja</a> would be held and the new gegö would come in. The jayig was in the room where the meeting was held as the ex-gegö has given it to them before hand.   

**A:**  Was the jayig hung on the pillar?   

**A:**  It was put there in the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཚོགས་འདུ] 1. The general name for the various types of Tibetan government assemblies. 2. Any assembly, e.g., the assembly (meeting) of monks in a college.">tsondu</a> hall on that day. But regularly it was handed over to the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. དགེ་སྐོས] The main disciplinary official in a monastic college (tratsang).">gegö</a> and was hung on the beam. At the same time, the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. གྲྭ་ཇ] The prayer session sponsored by the tratsang (college) at which tea was served to its monks who attended.">traja</a> was ready below the meeting hall and the first tea was served. Then the umdze did a prayer for tea, chamchö, [Tib. ཇ་མཆོད], the tea was served and the monks ate <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. སྤགས] A staple Tibetan dish of tsampa mixed with tea and kneaded into balls of dough-like consistency.">pag</a>. They ate the pag silently. At this time, the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. གྲྭ་ཚང] A &quot;college&quot; within a monastery, for example, in Drepung Monastery there were four main tratsang: Gomang, Loseling, Deyang and Ngagpa. These tratsang were property owning corporate entities and included monks who were organized into residential dormitories called Khamtsen.">tratsang</a>'s 4 <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཕྱག་སྦུག] A manager (of estates and endowments) of a monastic college or monastic khamtsen.">chabu</a> brought the 13th Dalai Lama's jayig to the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. འདུ་ཁང] An assembly hall in a monastery.">dukhang</a> where the new gegö was waiting. The chabu gave him the jayig. Then the new gegö read the jayig on the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཚོགས] 1. A prayer assembly meeting in monasteries when all the monks come to an assembly hall and chant prayers together. 2. An offering made of tsamba, butter and dry cheese in the shape of a cone.">tsog</a> while the monks were eating pag and then all the authority was with the new gegö.   

**Q:**  Would they discuss the things other than regarding the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. དགེ་སྐོས] The main disciplinary official in a monastic college (tratsang).">gegö</a>?   

**A:**  Then the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཚོགས་འདུ] 1. The general name for the various types of Tibetan government assemblies. 2. Any assembly, e.g., the assembly (meeting) of monks in a college.">tsondu</a> did an accounting with the old <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. དགེ་སྐོས] The main disciplinary official in a monastic college (tratsang).">gegö</a> and the umdze about money and <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཁ་བཏགས] A Tibetan ceremonial scarf given to lamas, visitors, etc.">khata</a> they have received as gifts over the past 6 months when someone dies. There was the custom where they pay some money for asking to do prayers, kyabten, [Tib. སྐྱབས་རྟེན] and a khata along with the kyabten and ask the gegö to read a note that so and so has died and we did the prayers for him and the gegö reads it in the tsog. After the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. གྲྭ་ཇ] The prayer session sponsored by the tratsang (college) at which tea was served to its monks who attended.">traja</a>, the gegö and umdze would put these in a box and lock the box. This was kept by the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཕྱག་སྦུག] A manager (of estates and endowments) of a monastic college or monastic khamtsen.">chabu</a> and he gives a (receipt). Then after 6 months we did the accounting of this. Then it was also decided where to give the money. At this time, they also decide where to put the new endowment given by the sponsor and to whom the money should be handed like the tsondu or the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. དངུལ་གཉེར] Accountant, bookkeeper, cashier. Someone in charge of cash.">ngünyer</a> etc.   

**Q:**  You said the money goes to two persons; one is the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཕྱག་སྦུག] A manager (of estates and endowments) of a monastic college or monastic khamtsen.">chabu</a> and one is the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. གཉེར་ཚང] 1. Storehouse. 2. Steward, person in charge of a storehouse. 3. A monastic official in charge of storerooms.">nyertsang</a>, right?   

**A:**  The money was spend by the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཕྱག་སྦུག] A manager (of estates and endowments) of a monastic college or monastic khamtsen.">chabu</a> and the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. གཉེར་ཚང] 1. Storehouse. 2. Steward, person in charge of a storehouse. 3. A monastic official in charge of storerooms.">nyertsang</a> and if the expenditure and the money they had becomes unbalanced, then the money would be supplemented by the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཚོགས་འདུ་རྒྱས་འཛོམས] The largest assembly of the traditional Tibetan government.">tsondu gyendzom</a> which was called Tsogteng, [Tib. ཚོགས་སྟེང] and they would divide the money to them. Usually, our <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. གྲྭ་ཚང] A &quot;college&quot; within a monastery, for example, in Drepung Monastery there were four main tratsang: Gomang, Loseling, Deyang and Ngagpa. These tratsang were property owning corporate entities and included monks who were organized into residential dormitories called Khamtsen.">tratsang</a> always becomes unbalanced on the expenditure and the income.   

**Q:**  <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. སྡེ་ཡངས] One of the colleges in Drepung Monastery.">Deyang</a> Tratsang had a good grain salary, druphog, [Tib. འབྲུ་ཕོགས], right?   

**A:**  Yes. This was very good. The other <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. གྲྭ་ཚང] A &quot;college&quot; within a monastery, for example, in Drepung Monastery there were four main tratsang: Gomang, Loseling, Deyang and Ngagpa. These tratsang were property owning corporate entities and included monks who were organized into residential dormitories called Khamtsen.">tratsang</a> would feel amazed about our grain salary because we had 6 <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཁལ] A traditional volume measurement used for measuring grain in traditional Tibetan society. Sizes of this unit varied somewhat, but the official government khe (called mkhar ru or bstan dzin mkha ru) weighed about 28-31 pounds for barley. It was used to convey the size of fields. For example, a field said to be 10 khe in size meant that 10 khe of seed could be sown on that field.">khe</a> of barley.   

**Q:**  What about other things happened like disputes etc?   

**A:**  This didn't really happen much. Most were settled without having to come to the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཚོགས་འདུ] 1. The general name for the various types of Tibetan government assemblies. 2. Any assembly, e.g., the assembly (meeting) of monks in a college.">tsondu</a>. Most things that weren't too serious were settled by the gegö. Larger ones were settled by the abbot. In case, something was reported to the tsondu, the tsondu had the authority to settle it.   

**Q:**  Can you give an example of the something that reached the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཚོགས་འདུ] 1. The general name for the various types of Tibetan government assemblies. 2. Any assembly, e.g., the assembly (meeting) of monks in a college.">tsondu</a>?   

**A:**  <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. སྡེ་ཡངས] One of the colleges in Drepung Monastery.">Deyang</a> Tratsang had a <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. གཞིས་ཀ] A manorial estate.">shiga</a> called Ley [Tib. སླེ] Shiga that was held on lease by Thamba Simkhang, [Tib. དན་འབག་གཟིམ་ཁང] who was our close sponsor. The oracle called Thamba Shango, [Tib. zhang go ?] was from that family. So the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. གྲྭ་ཚང] A &quot;college&quot; within a monastery, for example, in Drepung Monastery there were four main tratsang: Gomang, Loseling, Deyang and Ngagpa. These tratsang were property owning corporate entities and included monks who were organized into residential dormitories called Khamtsen.">tratsang</a> didn't dare to say anything to them. They gave 1 <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཁལ] A traditional volume measurement used for measuring grain in traditional Tibetan society. Sizes of this unit varied somewhat, but the official government khe (called mkhar ru or bstan dzin mkha ru) weighed about 28-31 pounds for barley. It was used to convey the size of fields. For example, a field said to be 10 khe in size meant that 10 khe of seed could be sown on that field.">khe</a> of grain for each monk in Deyang as the lease and they have to give a little bit grain to the tratsang. It was said that the shiga had good fields and the common monks heard about this and said that they wanted the shiga back and thought 1 khe per monk was too little. But the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཚོགས་འདུ] 1. The general name for the various types of Tibetan government assemblies. 2. Any assembly, e.g., the assembly (meeting) of monks in a college.">tsondu</a> was afraid to say anything to Thamba Simkhang since they were tratsang's main sponsor. After a while, there was some trouble, but the tsondu gyendzom could not make decisions. So the common monks convened a meeting of their own about this. At that time, I was also among the common monks. The common monks said that Deyang should take back the shiga and manage it by the tratsang. We can't leave it with one family. We were losing a lot.   

**Q:**  Where did they common monks hold the meeting?   

**A:**  The common monks met in the chöra.   

**Q:**  Who called the meeting?   

**A:**  The common monks themselves told one another to come at such and such time. They also rested their hope on some capable monks and then the common monks became strong and they could take back the shiga. The common monks went to the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཚོགས་འདུ] 1. The general name for the various types of Tibetan government assemblies. 2. Any assembly, e.g., the assembly (meeting) of monks in a college.">tsondu</a> and held the meeting together and the common monks selected and appointed the new shidü and also appointed the people to hand over the shiga.   

**Q:**  When was this?   

**A:**  This was just before the revolt.   

**Q:**  Did the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཕྱག་སྦུག] A manager (of estates and endowments) of a monastic college or monastic khamtsen.">chabu</a> settle the matter?   

**A:**  No. They couldn't.   

**Q:**  If the matter was not very serious, the abbot would settle it, right?   

**A:**  Yes.   

**Q:**  What I heard was that you saved up the big issues to bring up to the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཚོགས་འདུ] 1. The general name for the various types of Tibetan government assemblies. 2. Any assembly, e.g., the assembly (meeting) of monks in a college.">tsondu</a> that was held each 6 months and settle them at once.   

**A:**  Probably not. Usually, when the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཚོགས་འདུ] 1. The general name for the various types of Tibetan government assemblies. 2. Any assembly, e.g., the assembly (meeting) of monks in a college.">tsondu</a> needs to appoint the new <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཕྱག་སྦུག] A manager (of estates and endowments) of a monastic college or monastic khamtsen.">chabu</a> and <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. གཉེར་ཚང] 1. Storehouse. 2. Steward, person in charge of a storehouse. 3. A monastic official in charge of storerooms.">nyertsang</a>, they were appointed by the tsondu. There were two people who were named nyertsang, but actually there were 5-6 people running the nyertsang. Those under the nyertsang such as <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཇ་མ] The monk(s) in charge of a monastery&#x27;s kitchen.">jama</a>, shidü and nangnyer were appointed by the tsondu. Some of them these nyertsang stayed in the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. གྲྭ་ཚང] A &quot;college&quot; within a monastery, for example, in Drepung Monastery there were four main tratsang: Gomang, Loseling, Deyang and Ngagpa. These tratsang were property owning corporate entities and included monks who were organized into residential dormitories called Khamtsen.">tratsang</a> and work as jama and some went as shidü to the shiga.   

**Q:**  Can you give an example of what Jaglang Bugpai Theb [Tib. ལྕགས་གླང་སྦུག་པའི་དེབ] is?   

**A:**  It's a big book about the size of the big dictionary here. E.G. It was written like the head line, Barchö Chöra, [Tib. དབར་ཆོས་ཆོས་ར]which was held between Mönlam and Tsongchö, [Tib. ཙོགས་མཆོད] and below this it was written, on such and such day, so and so sponsor would give the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. གྲྭ་ཇ] The prayer session sponsored by the tratsang (college) at which tea was served to its monks who attended.">traja</a> etc. It lists all those for the 15 days of the barchö <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཆོས་ར] The special grove (&quot;dharma grove&quot;) in monasteries where monks formally met to practice debating.">chöra</a> in order. On the 30th of the 2nd Tibetan month, the procession called Tsongchö Serbang, [Tib. ཙོགས་མཆོད་སེར་སྦྲེང] is held. And there were monthly chöra, [Tib. ཟླ་ཆོས] from the 3rd of the 3rd Tibetan month to the 3rd of the 4th Tibetan month. This had the head line, Jichö Chenmo, [Tib. དཔྱིད་ཆོས་ཆེན་མོ] which was written in the book.   

**Q:**  Did they write in this book about the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. གཏོང་སྒོ] A monastic obligation to provide the food and other necessary items served at a monastic prayer assembly meeting or some other rite; this was often a required obligation for monastic officials at the end of their term of office.">tonggo</a> that the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. གཉེར་ཚང] 1.

A monastic official in charge of storerooms.">nyertsang</a> gives from the income they get from the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. གཞིས་ཀ] A manorial estate.">shiga</a>?

Storehouse. 2. Steward, person in charge of a storehouse. 3. A monastic official in charge of storerooms.">nyertsang</a> gave were not listed in the Jaglang Bugpai Theb. In the Jaglang Bugpai Theb, they list only the salary endowments left by the sponsors. If a sponsor leaves other endowment like 1,000 <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. རྡོ་ཚད] A currency unit in traditional Tibet that was equal to 50 ngüsang.">dotse</a>, this would go to one of the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. དངུལ་གཉེར] Accountant, bookkeeper, cashier.

If you had to look at it where was it?   

**A:**  They had their own book and they would check it. There was no way to cheat. The <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. གཉེར་ཚང] 1. Storehouse. 2. Steward, person in charge of a storehouse. 3. A monastic official in charge of storerooms.">nyertsang</a> and <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཕྱག་སྦུག] A manager (of estates and endowments) of a monastic college or monastic khamtsen.">chabu</a> also have some endowment. The salary or tea was given by the office who had received the endowment and the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. དགེ་སྐོས] The main disciplinary official in a monastic college (tratsang).">gegö</a> would be given a slip of paper on the night before saying that the salary endowment given by such and such sponsors was going to be given on the next day and the gegö would read it in the tsog. Then they check whether the slip and the book matches or not.   

**Q:**  Did the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. དགེ་སྐོས] The main disciplinary official in a monastic college (tratsang).">gegö</a> check like the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. གཉེར་ཚང] 1. Storehouse. 2. Steward, person in charge of a storehouse. 3. A monastic official in charge of storerooms.">nyertsang</a>'s big salary paid on the Ganden Ngamjö.   

**A:**  The <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. དགེ་སྐོས] The main disciplinary official in a monastic college (tratsang).">gegö</a> did not need to check this because this is a very big payment. These became kind of regular and everyone knows what they have to give. But the gegö would check whether the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. གཉེར་ཚང] 1. Storehouse. 2. Steward, person in charge of a storehouse. 3. A monastic official in charge of storerooms.">nyertsang</a> gave the salary properly or not and if not they would tell them.
