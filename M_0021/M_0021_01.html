<p> The couple interviewed were poor miser who were living on one of Deyang College&apos;s estates. The husband (Namgyal Temba) was a miser of Deyang and the wife was a miser of Tashilhunpo Monastery. In this interview, they individually provide details of their family life and their livelihood in the old society, especially what corv&#xE9;e work (ula) they had to do. Although they were a taxpayer household (treba) with land, they could not do the work (manage the land), so they lost the land and became d&#xFC;jung living on the edge of poverty. The husband discusses how their livelihood improved significantly when he was sent by th estate to do road construction work for a Tibetan government-Chinese joint project and received Chinese wages in dayan coins.   </p>

<p><strong>Q:</strong>  Today we came here to examine how the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. &#xF66;&#xFA1;&#xF7A;&#xF0B;&#xF61;&#xF44;&#xF66;] One of the colleges in Drepung Monastery.">Deyang</a> colege&apos;s estates operated. Dr Goldstein is mainly doing research on the monastery and he will ask you questions. Dr. Goldstein is very good in Tibetan language and he is same as a Tibetan and he wrote on the history of Tibet. And he speaks Tibetan very well.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  What is your name?   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  My name is Pemba [Tib. &#xF66;&#xFA4;&#xF7A;&#xF53;&#xF0B;&#xF54;].   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  Do you have a family name?   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  I don&apos;t have any family name. This area was called Khotsang [Tib. kha tshang ?]. In the past, there used to be an oil extracting house here. That&apos;s why it is called Khotsang.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  Are you from here and were you born hear?   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  I was born here.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  Did you come here as a bride or did you take a bridegroom? How did you become a family here?   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  I was from this household. My father was the son of the household near the gorge [Tib. &#xF42;&#xF66;&#xF0B;&#xF54;] and my mother was born in <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. &#xF42;&#xF59;&#xF44;] One of the major sub-areas of Tibet that is located in southwest Tibet. Its main city is Shigatse.">Tsang</a> [Tib. &#xF42;&#xF59;&#xF44;]. My great grandfather was working on construction for the Tibetan government (Dewashung). My grandfather took my mother here when she was little. After that, my mother got together with my father and in the beginning they worked on a <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. &#xF41;&#xFB2;&#xF63;&#xF0B;&#xF62;&#xF90;&#xF44;] The name of the basic tax unit for arable land in traditional Tibetan society. Families with farm land would have one or more fields of different sizes, e.g., 1 tregang or 1/2 of a tregang. This was defined by a fixed number of khe of seed (tib. s&#xF6;nkhe) that would be sown on that field. For example, one tregang in some areas would consist of 10 s&#xF6;nkhe. There was substantial variation between and within regions and types of estates.">tregang</a> (tax unit of arable land). When they were unable to work the full tregang of land, they worked on a half tregang of land which was called nangchag [Tib. &#xF42;&#xF53;&#xF44;&#xF66;&#xF0B;&#xF46;&#xF42;]. For this, we had to work on alternative days. At that time, my parents had 4-5 children who were not grown up, so they hired a servant for the whole year. We also had to hire a servant at the harvest time to do the threshing called <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. &#xF49;&#xF72;&#xF66;&#xF0B;&#xF66;&#xF90;&#xF74;&#xF63;] The name of a corv&#xE9;e tax that required sending a worker during the harvest and plowing periods.">nyik&#xFC;</a> [Tib. &#xF49;&#xF72;&#xF66;&#xF0B;&#xF66;&#xF90;&#xF74;&#xF63;].   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  At that time, you were working on the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. &#xF41;&#xFB2;&#xF63;&#xF0B;&#xF62;&#xF90;&#xF44;] The name of the basic tax unit for arable land in traditional Tibetan society.

There was substantial variation between and within regions and types of estates.">tregang</a>, right?   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  Yes, and our home was here. After that, I met my husband, so we got separated from my natal family and my mother made me to live here.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  Did you just get together (with no formal marrige ceremony) [Tib. &#xF41;&#xF0B;&#xF50;&#xF74;&#xF42;] with your husband?   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  Yes, my husband&apos;s home is just down there and they were a <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. &#xF41;&#xFB2;&#xF63;&#xF0B;&#xF54;] The class of bound peasant/miser/serf households who held farmland and had to fulfill large corv&#xE9;e tax obligations to their manorial estates/lords.

While some of these were well off by local standards, many were poor due to a variety of factors such as heavy debts and a dearth of able-bodied workers in their households.">treba</a> household and we merged together here.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  You got settled here?   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  Yes.   </p>

<p><strong>A:</strong>  We were unable to work for the taxes because we didn&apos;t have <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. &#xF62;&#xFA9;&#xF58;&#xF0B;&#xF54;] The traditional Tibetan staple food that consists of grain that is roasted (popped), usually in heated sand, and then ground into a flour.">tsamba</a> to take when we had to go to work as <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. &#xF60;&#xF74;&#xF63;&#xF0B;&#xF63;&#xF42;] A generic term for corv&#xE9;e labor that had to be performed for one&apos;s manorial estate/lord without pay.

When we had a little tsamba, we went to work for the ula. So we missed work for 2-3 days. On the 4th of the 4th lunar month, all the people were going to Sangu [Tib. &#xF42;&#xF66;&#xF44;&#xF0B;&#xF55;&#xF74;] to burn incense and do prayers.

At that time, the crops for which the seed had been taken as a loan had grown this high. We hadn&apos;t had any seed of our own.

At that time, three households told us they want our tregang of land. There were three households who wanted that land. Therefore, we went to Sangu to ask divination from the oracle who went into trance. The divination came in favor of the old woman Tseten Dr&#xF6;kar&apos;s [Tib. &#xF5A;&#xF7A;&#xF0B;&#xF56;&#xF62;&#xF9F;&#xF53;&#xF0B;&#xF66;&#xF92;&#xFB2;&#xF7C;&#xF63;&#xF0B;&#xF51;&#xF40;&#xF62;] family. After that, my husband and I went to work on road building in Kongpo and also went to build the airport. At home, we didn&apos;t have anything and we had a baby who could hardly walk so we carried that baby and went to work on road building.   </p>

<p><strong>A:</strong>  Yes.   </p>

<p><strong>A:</strong>  Yes. We had to send one person everyday all year round. At the time of Wongkor [Tib. &#xF60;&#xF7C;&#xF44;&#xF0B;&#xF66;&#xF90;&#xF7C;&#xF62;] Festival when people carry scriptures around the field and during the New Year, we had three days off. They would send us to wash our hair on the 30th. If the shid&#xFC; (estate manager) was good then he would give us a day off on the 3rd day. If the shid&#xFC; was not good, then he would call us to work on 3rd day. It was also same for the Wongkor.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  At that time, did you have a day off on the 15th and 30th of the lunar month?   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  No, there was no day off.   </p>

<p><strong>A:</strong>  In summer, we have to do the weeding. And after that, they would send us to cut the incense which would be made into round shape. They would send us to cut incense for 10-11 days.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  When you went to cut the incense, how much did 1 person have to cut per day?   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  If we take our bedding and the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. &#xF42;&#xF5E;&#xF72;&#xF66;&#xF0B;&#xF40;] A manorial estate.">shiga</a> (estate) gave us a kind of beverage, we had to go to the mountains and had to cut 10 bundle of incense per day which was a big bundle, not like the small incense bundles in present days.   </p>

<p><strong>A:</strong>  Yes. If you didn&apos;t take your bedding and came back in the evening, then you had to cut 5 bundles and take it to the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. &#xF42;&#xF5E;&#xF72;&#xF66;&#xF0B;&#xF40;] A manorial estate.">shiga</a> (estate).   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  That was during the summer right?   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  Yes. After that, we have to collect firewood for the shiga.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  What kind of firewood did you have to collect? Was it cow dung?   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  No, we have to collect switches (twigs) [Tib. &#xF64;&#xF72;&#xF44;&#xF0B;&#xF5A;&#xF42;&#xF84;] for firewood.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  When you are saying accumulating switches that means you have to collect it because you were not allowed to cut the trees, right?   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  No, we had to cut the firewood. The place we went to cut the firewood belonged to the shiga.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  Can you cut the firewood from the tree?   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  No, the whole area belonged to the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. &#xF42;&#xF5E;&#xF72;&#xF66;&#xF0B;&#xF40;] A manorial estate.">shiga</a>, so we can go to collect the firewood anywhere.

<p><strong>Q:</strong>  So you have to go to the mountain to collect the firewood, right?   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  We had to pull it out. After that, we had to cut the grass in the canal and the fields, and they would also make two people work carrying sickles, <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. &#xF49;&#xF72;&#xF66;&#xF0B;&#xF66;&#xF90;&#xF74;&#xF63;] The name of a corv&#xE9;e tax that required sending a worker during the harvest and plowing periods.">nyik&#xFC;</a> [Tib. &#xF49;&#xF72;&#xF66;&#xF0B;&#xF66;&#xF90;&#xF74;&#xF63;].   </p>

<p><strong>A:</strong>  It was until the threshing is over which was just before the New Year. We had to cut the grass in the fields and the canal.

<p><strong>Q:</strong>  What did you do in winter?   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  In winter, we had to do the threshing for a very long time because at that time there were no machines. We had to depend on yak for doing the threshing (Tib. &#xF61;&#xF42;&#xF46;&#xF42; [&#xF42;&#xF61;&#xF42;&#xF0B;&#xF46;&#xF42;&#xF66;]) and sometimes it tooks about half a month. Threshing would take the whole winter and would be finished after the New Year. The quickest threshing would be over in the 12th lunar month. After the threshing, we had to take out the fertilizer to the fields.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  How many family members did you have?   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  I don&apos;t have family members.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  In the old society, how many family member did you have?   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  At that time, we had 8 family members, 6 children and the parents. I am the oldest child.

There was substantial variation between and within regions and types of estates.">tregang</a> and the loans or did the estate divide it?   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  The estate didn&apos;t do that. Usually, they would collect something called (Tib. g&#xF6;ph&#xFC; [Tib. &#xF56;&#xF42;&#xF7C;&#xF66;&#xF0B;&#xF55;&#xF74;&#xF51;])and they would take away quite a lot of things from the rich households, but when we got divided, since we were poor, we didn&apos;t have anything to collect.   </p>

<p><strong>A:</strong>  Yes.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  So you stayed separate (from them) because you had your husband right?   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  Yes.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  So you took the land called nangchag right?   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  Yes.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  About you and your husband staying separate, you had discussed this with your family members, right?   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  In our home my mother and uncle didn&apos;t get along well. So the two of us lived separately. Therefore, we two were unable to work for the taxes, so we gave back the land with the crops growing and we worked as Duwa Namtong a kind of tax where all the people living in that area have to work.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  After you separated from your family, how long did you stay working half of the tax?   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  We stayed just for three year, and then we were unable to work for the tax.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  On the 3rd year you were unable to work for the tax and you handed over the land with the crops right?   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  Yes.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  After that, what did you do?   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  Then we worked doing the Duwa Namtong.   </p>

<p><strong>A:</strong>  Since I got married, I had to stay separate from the main family which we did. We moved and we took half of the tax land. But we were not able to work doing the ulag tax so we returned the tax land.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  To whom did you return the tax land? Did you return the land to the estate or your family?   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  We returned it to the estate. The estate (shiga) gave the tax land to a person who was able to do the ulag work for it. According to the policy, it was not allowed to hand over or take the land with the crops, but we had to hand it over because they almost beat us up, so we gave the land.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  When she got married were there other children in home?   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  Her family had several children and she was the oldest one. When she got together with her husband, then she have to separate from the main family and left behind her parent and brothers and sisters.   </p>

Families with farm land would have one or more fields of different sizes, e.g., 1 tregang or 1/2 of a tregang. This was defined by a fixed number of khe of seed (tib. s&#xF6;nkhe) that would be sown on that field. For example, one tregang in some areas would consist of 10 s&#xF6;nkhe. There was substantial variation between and within regions and types of estates.">tregang</a>?   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  She talked with her parents and they decided and she didn&apos;t interfere. When they divided the family, they didn&apos;t have anything to offer, otherwise if they had something, then they would have to do g&#xF6;pu which they didn&apos;t get because they had nothing. Since she and her husband were living together here, they took the half of the tregang.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  Why they couldn&apos;t they do the ulag? What was the difficulty?   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  Remember she told us that together with the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. &#xF41;&#xFB2;&#xF63;&#xF0B;&#xF62;&#xF90;&#xF44;] The name of the basic tax unit for arable land in traditional Tibetan society.

What was the main reason that you couldn&apos;t work on the tregang?   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  At that time, we didn&apos;t have <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. &#xF62;&#xFA9;&#xF58;&#xF0B;&#xF54;] The traditional Tibetan staple food that consists of grain that is roasted (popped), usually in heated sand, and then ground into a flour.">tsamba</a> to take (when they went to work) and since we have just two people, nobody would give us a loan.

At that time, we had to return the tregang otherwise they were about to whip us [for not doing the ula work].   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  When you separated from your family you took half of the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. &#xF41;&#xFB2;&#xF63;&#xF0B;&#xF62;&#xF90;&#xF44;] The name of the basic tax unit for arable land in traditional Tibetan society.

<p><strong>A:</strong>  My family ask me to take 300 <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. &#xF41;&#xF63;] A traditional volume measurement used for measuring grain in traditional Tibetan society. Sizes of this unit varied somewhat, but the official government khe (called mkhar ru or bstan dzin mkha ru) weighed about 28-31 pounds for barley. It was used to convey the size of fields.

<p><strong>Q:</strong>  What happened when you returned the land with the loan? How did you do the loan?   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  We worked for other people and paid quite a lot of the loan.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  Wait a minute. Did you owe 300 <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. &#xF41;&#xF63;] A traditional volume measurement used for measuring grain in traditional Tibetan society.

<p><strong>A:</strong>  We didn&apos;t owe the loan to the shiga. We had to pay the loan to big households like Lasampa [Tib.?], Ganden Shartse [Tib. &#xF51;&#xF42;&#xF60;&#xF0B;&#xF63;&#xFA1;&#xF53;&#xF0B;&#xF64;&#xF62;&#xF0B;&#xF62;&#xFA9;&#xF7A;], K&#xFC;ndeling [Tib. &#xF40;&#xF74;&#xF53;&#xF0B;&#xF56;&#xF51;&#xF7A;&#xF0B;&#xF42;&#xFB3;&#xF72;&#xF44;] and other internal households [Tib. &#xF53;&#xF44;&#xF0B;&#xF41;&#xF74;&#xF63;]. At first, our parents took the loan from wherever they could get it because they couldn&apos;t raise their children. Later, I was the oldest child in the house. So they divided the tax land together with the loan.   </p>

<p><strong>A:</strong>  We took the loans because we had to put seed on the farmland. Therefore, we had to take the loan.   </p>

<p><strong>A:</strong>  Yes.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  Your parents sent the loan with half of the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. &#xF41;&#xFB2;&#xF63;&#xF0B;&#xF62;&#xF90;&#xF44;] The name of the basic tax unit for arable land in traditional Tibetan society.

The loan was left over with the two of you, right?   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  Yes, you are right.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  Therefore, did you get the chance to pay off the loan?   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  We paid it quite well.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  How much loan did you pay off before the liberation?   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  Before the liberation, we paid about half of it. After we lost the tax land we went to do road building in Kongpo.

My gegen called my father and said, &quot;I can&apos;t stay in the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. &#xF42;&#xFB2;&#xFAD;&#xF0B;&#xF5A;&#xF44;] A &quot;college&quot; within a monastery, for example, in Drepung Monastery there were four main tratsang: Gomang, Loseling, Deyang and Ngagpa. These tratsang were property owning corporate entities and included monks who were organized into residential dormitories called Khamtsen.">tratsang</a> (college) because it is too strict. I am going to Kham as a soldier and I don&apos;t know if I will be able to come back or not, so you shoud find a new gegen for him or do whatever you want with your child.&quot; Then my gegen handed me over to my father.

After that, my father, who was a <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. &#xF41;&#xFB2;&#xF63;&#xF0B;&#xF54;] The class of bound peasant/miser/serf households who held farmland and had to fulfill large corv&#xE9;e tax obligations to their manorial estates/lords.

There were 4-5 monks who wanted to be my gegen, so they did the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. &#xF5F;&#xF53;&#xF0B;&#xF62;&#xF72;&#xF63;] A divine lottery. Multiple answers to a question were written on paper of the same size and rolled in dough balls of the same size and weight.

I just learned 4-5 words in a day and I didn&apos;t get the chance to study completely. When I was 19-20 years old my gegen died. After that I stayed in a separate shag and adhered to the monks discipline. When I was 25 years old I came back home. After that, I did farming. When I was 26 years old I met my wife and when I was 28, we both left our natal families and stayed together and settled as a household.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  So two of you settled here?   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  Yes, we divided the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. &#xF41;&#xFB2;&#xF63;&#xF0B;&#xF62;&#xF90;&#xF44;] The name of the basic tax unit for arable land in traditional Tibetan society. Families with farm land would have one or more fields of different sizes, e.g., 1 tregang or 1/2 of a tregang. This was defined by a fixed number of khe of seed (tib. s&#xF6;nkhe) that would be sown on that field. For example, one tregang in some areas would consist of 10 s&#xF6;nkhe.

They would give us some tea leaves called Porthang [Tib. ?] which were collected from the mountains. They would give us the grease [Tib. &#xF5E;&#xF42;] they got from the monk&apos;s tea bowls, as the butter to be added on the tea. We didn&apos;t have tsamba and we had to do every kind of work for the Deyang estate, like going to the mountains and going down to the valleys. On top of that, I have go to work for the chitr for the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. &#xF66;&#xFA1;&#xF7A;&#xF0B;&#xF56;&#xF0B;&#xF42;&#xF5E;&#xF74;&#xF44;] The name of the traditional Tibetan government.">dewashung</a> [outer tax, i.e., corv&#xE9;e tax for the government).

From the top of the mountain pass I put the load on the donkey and come down.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  Where did you have to transport the grain?   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  I had to transport the grain to the main gate of <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. &#xF5E;&#xF7C;&#xF63;] The walled town beneath the Potala Palace in Lhasa.">Shol</a> [Tib. &#xF42;&#xF5E;&#xF74;&#xF44;&#xF0B;&#xF66;&#xF92;&#xF7C;&#xF60;&#xF72;&#xF0B;&#xF50;&#xF7C;&#xF42;&#xF0B;&#xF41;] [the village/town in front of the Potala].   </p>

<p><strong>A:</strong>  Yes.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  You are talking about a mountain pass, so which mountain pass was that?   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  The name of the mountain pass is Nyase la [Tib. ?] which is located near the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. &#xF62;&#xF58;&#xF0B;&#xF58;&#xF0B;&#xF66;&#xF92;&#xF44;] A ferry site on the Lhasa River south of Lhasa City.">Ramagang</a> [Tib. &#xF62;&#xF0B;&#xF58;&#xF0B;&#xF66;&#xF92;&#xF44;] [ferry site].

An area below Sera Monastery. 2. The location of the Tibetan Armory-Mint Office and the regimental headquarters of the Khadang Regiment, which was also called the Trapchi Regiment.">Trapchi</a> Regiment. For that, we had to transport the grain to the Trapchi Regiment. That&apos;s how we worked for the chitre. We had to find <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. &#xF62;&#xFA9;&#xF58;&#xF0B;&#xF54;] The traditional Tibetan staple food that consists of grain that is roasted (popped), usually in heated sand, and then ground into a flour.">tsamba</a> by ourselves and had to remain half full and half hungry. We didn&apos;t have the chance to touch a bag load of tsamba year round. One person had to work for the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. &#xF60;&#xF74;&#xF63;&#xF0B;&#xF63;&#xF42;] A generic term for corv&#xE9;e labor that had to be performed for one&apos;s manorial estate/lord without pay. One kind of ula required people to go and work and another kind required the provision of transportation animals.">ula</a> and other person had to go to mountains and collect incense and transport it to Lhasa.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  Was that a sideline work?   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  Yes, it is like a sideline work in present days. At that time, the main livelihood depended on the mountains from where we got such things as cow dung which we sold and bought the worst quality <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. &#xF62;&#xFA9;&#xF58;&#xF0B;&#xF54;] The traditional Tibetan staple food that consists of grain that is roasted (popped), usually in heated sand, and then ground into a flour.">tsamba</a> that was called called kamsog [Tib. &#xF66;&#xF90;&#xF58;&#xF0B;&#xF66;&#xF7C;&#xF42;]. It looked like powdered donkey dung. We had only one donkey so we loaded two loads of cow dung on the donkey and we had to carry two loads on our backs and sell them. That&apos;s how we spent our lives. Sometimes, we didn&apos;t find the red inferior tsamba so we bought the Torma offerings from the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. &#xF47;&#xF7C;&#xF0B;&#xF41;&#xF44;] A most famous temple in Lhasa that houses a holy statue of the Buddha. It is often used to mean the Tsuglagang Temple of which it is a part.">Jokhang</a> and took it to the mountains when we work as a <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. &#xF60;&#xF74;&#xF63;&#xF0B;&#xF63;&#xF42;] A generic term for corv&#xE9;e labor that had to be performed for one&apos;s manorial estate/lord without pay.

<p><strong>Q:</strong>  At that time, when you were working for the alternating day ulatax, how many <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. &#xF41;&#xF63;] A traditional volume measurement used for measuring grain in traditional Tibetan society. Sizes of this unit varied somewhat, but the official government khe (called mkhar ru or bstan dzin mkha ru) weighed about 28-31 pounds for barley. It was used to convey the size of fields. For example, a field said to be 10 khe in size meant that 10 khe of seed could be sown on that field.">khe</a> of land did you plant?   </p>

For example, a field said to be 10 khe in size meant that 10 khe of seed could be sown on that field.">khe</a> and 10 dre. That was like the capital, but we could only plant one or two fields because we didn&apos;t have the capability. So other people were telling us to lease the land. We had only one or two fields we were planting plant. And when we planted the fields, we had to ask <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. &#xF66;&#xFA1;&#xF7A;&#xF0B;&#xF61;&#xF44;&#xF66;] One of the colleges in Drepung Monastery.">Deyang</a> Tratsang for a loan. Even though we were the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. &#xF58;&#xF72;&#xF0B;&#xF66;&#xF7A;&#xF62;] A term that can mean serf/bound subject as well as citizen, depending on context. For example, the miser of a lord would connote the bound subjects of that lord, whereas the miser of Tibet would connote citizens of Tibet.">miser</a> of the College, they wouldn&apos;t give us a loan because we were not capable and we had only two people (workers in their household). They would just lend us only 2-3 khe. They would lend the good households amounts like 20-30 khe. So we just used a little bit for the seeds for planting, and that&apos;s how we spent our lives. On the 4th of the 6th lunar month, all the Deyang Tratsang&apos;s miser have to go to the mountains to collect firewood for 12-15 days. We had to take our bedding to the mountains. When we went to the mountains we didn&apos;t have <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. &#xF62;&#xFA9;&#xF58;&#xF0B;&#xF54;] The traditional Tibetan staple food that consists of grain that is roasted (popped), usually in heated sand, and then ground into a flour.">tsamba</a> to take, so we asked for a 4 day leave from the work supervisor [Tib. &#xF63;&#xF66;&#xF0B;&#xF51;&#xF54;&#xF7C;&#xF53;] to prepare tsamba. He said, &quot;That will be fine. You can prepare your tsamba and come back to work later to make up the 4 days that you missed. Then we also had to bring the firewood to the estate. Then after two days, they were saying that I didn&apos;t come to work for the corv&#xE9;e <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. &#xF60;&#xF74;&#xF63;&#xF0B;&#xF63;&#xF42;] A generic term for corv&#xE9;e labor that had to be performed for one&apos;s manorial estate/lord without pay.

This was defined by a fixed number of khe of seed (tib. s&#xF6;nkhe) that would be sown on that field. For example, one tregang in some areas would consist of 10 s&#xF6;nkhe. There was substantial variation between and within regions and types of estates.">tregang</a> holders (on the estate), you two are disgraceful. It is like the proverb, &quot;among the 8 Namse wealth deity riders, there is one disgraceful deity walking [Tib. &#xF62;&#xFA3;&#xF58;&#xF0B;&#xF66;&#xFB2;&#xF66;&#xF0B;&#xF62;&#xF9F;&#xF0B;&#xF56;&#xF51;&#xF42;&#xF0B;&#xF56;&#xF62;&#xF92;&#xFB1;&#xF51;&#xF0B;&#xF63;&#xF0B;&#xF5E;&#xF56;&#xF66;&#xF0B;&#xF60;&#xF51;&#xFB2;&#xF7A;&#xF53;&#xF0B;&#xF62;&#xF90;&#xF44;&#xF0B;&#xF50;&#xF44;&#xF0B;&#xF42;&#xF45;&#xF72;&#xF42;]. At that time, I was young. I went to the roof of the house. He was coming after me and I thought of jumping from the roof. He told me to come back. After that, I didn&apos;t come back, but he didn&apos;t follow me. So he stayed right there. If he had come towards me I had thought of jumping off it. Then he said come here, but I didn&apos;t go because I thought If I went there he might beat me up. After that, he said, &quot;From tomorrow you don&apos;t need to come to work for the corv&#xE9;e tax and we are going to take your tregang of land back because there are many people waiting for the land. It is like the proverb, &quot;the crows waiting for the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. &#xF42;&#xF4F;&#xF7C;&#xF62;&#xF0B;&#xF58;] A ritual offering made from tsamba and water.">torma</a> offering.&quot; Among the Duwa Namtong (d&#xFC;jung landless households), there were 3-5 household who were better off than the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. &#xF41;&#xFB2;&#xF63;&#xF0B;&#xF54;] The class of bound peasant/miser/serf households who held farmland and had to fulfill large corv&#xE9;e tax obligations to their manorial estates/lords. They are often called taxpayer households in English. While some of these were well off by local standards, many were poor due to a variety of factors such as heavy debts and a dearth of able-bodied workers in their households.">treba</a> (taxpayer households). That was on the 5th or 6th of the 6th month.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  At that time, how old were you?   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  At that time, I was 29 years old [1959]. At that time, the crops had grown this high. On the next day, they told the work supervisors not to make us work and sent us back and they also told us it will not be okay if you go to work any more. In that year, we had gotten quite good amount of loan so we had planted 8-9 fields and the crops were also good. Then they took over the land with crops [Tib. &#xF66;&#xF94;&#xF7C;&#xF0B;&#xF50;&#xF7C;&#xF42;] growing on it. Some people were saying that even in other countries, if some one took over the land with crops on it, it is like killing the people. Some of the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. &#xF41;&#xFB2;&#xF63;&#xF0B;&#xF54;] The class of bound peasant/miser/serf households who held farmland and had to fulfill large corv&#xE9;e tax obligations to their manorial estates/lords. They are often called taxpayer households in English. While some of these were well off by local standards, many were poor due to a variety of factors such as heavy debts and a dearth of able-bodied workers in their households.">treba</a> told me that I should report this to the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. &#xF62;&#xFAB;&#xF7C;&#xF44;] A district in the traditional Tibetan governmental structure. This large administrative unit was headed by one or two district heads (tib. dzongp&#xF6;n [&#xF62;&#xFAB;&#xF7C;&#xF44;&#xF0B;&#xF51;&#xF54;&#xF7C;&#xF53;]) appointed by the Tibetan government. Typically there was one lay official and one monk official who were jointly sent from Lhasa for three year terms. They were responsible for collecting taxes and adjudicating disputes in their district. These dzong were equivalent to counties (ch. &#x53BF;) in the current Chinese system of administration.">dzong</a> (district) and they will help me on that. I told them that if I report it to the dzong, they might beat me up. I thought it would be better to become a Duwa Namtong and go to the mountains to collect something and sell that in Lhasa so I said I can&apos;t make an appeal to the dzong because I don&apos;t have <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. &#xF62;&#xFA9;&#xF58;&#xF0B;&#xF54;] The traditional Tibetan staple food that consists of grain that is roasted (popped), usually in heated sand, and then ground into a flour.">tsamba</a> to eat. One of the household heads was saying, &quot;if you could bear the beating, then there would be no problem. Can you bear the beating? I said I can bear beatings 5-6 times. I don&apos;t think they will beat me all day long because I didn&apos;t lie and steal. I had been beaten with switches when I was in the monastery. Anyhow, they took over my land and handed it over to the other households. After that, we became like dead people. We didn&apos;t go to work for the corv&#xE9;e <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. &#xF60;&#xF74;&#xF63;&#xF0B;&#xF63;&#xF42;] A generic term for corv&#xE9;e labor that had to be performed for one&apos;s manorial estate/lord without pay. One kind of ula required people to go and work and another kind required the provision of transportation animals.">ula</a> tax. After that, I went to the mountains to collect cow dung. Then the People&apos;s Liberation Army started the road construction at the Kuru [Tib. &#xF40;&#xF74;&#xF0B;&#xF62;&#xF74;] Bridge. At that time, the Chinese and the Tibetan government (dewashung) both made us work. <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. &#xF66;&#xFA1;&#xF7A;&#xF0B;&#xF61;&#xF44;&#xF66;] One of the colleges in Drepung Monastery.">Deyang</a> estate (shiga) had to send one person so I went to work on the road construction and my wife stayed home. They collected the 3 <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. &#xF56;&#xFB2;&#xF7A;] A unit of traditional volume measurement [a container] in Tibet, 20 of which typically equaled one khe or bo [also a container], although in some areas there were only 16 dre in one khe.">dre</a> of tsamba, and little bit of flour, butter and tea leaves from the people here (since he was going on behalf of the estate&apos;s obligation). I went to do the road construction and I stayed there for three months.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  Did they consider working on the construction as the work done by the Duwa Namtong for the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. &#xF66;&#xFA1;&#xF7A;&#xF0B;&#xF61;&#xF44;&#xF66;] One of the colleges in Drepung Monastery.">Deyang</a> Shiga or not?   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  Yes, it would be considered as work of the estate (shiga). After three months when I came back, I had received a good salary and I got quite a good amount of <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. &#xF51;&#xF0B;&#xF61;&#xF44;; ch. &#x5927;&#x6D0B;] A Chinese silver dollar that had the image of Yuan Shikai on its face.

I also worked very hard. From that time on, by the grace of the Communist Party, our livelihood got better, like a sick person walking with a cane. We also went to mountains in winter. At that time, we had one child who was about 6 years old. Then we went to Kongpo for the road construction.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  Going to Kongpo was also included in this same construction project, right??   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  Yes.   </p>
