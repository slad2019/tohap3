## Abstract  

 The couple interviewed were poor miser who were living on one of Deyang College's estates. The husband (Namgyal Temba) was a miser of Deyang and the wife was a miser of Tashilhunpo Monastery. In this interview, they individually provide details of their family life and their livelihood in the old society, especially what corvée work (ula) they had to do. Although they were a taxpayer household (treba) with land, they could not do the work (manage the land), so they lost the land and became düjung living on the edge of poverty. The husband discusses how their livelihood improved significantly when he was sent by th estate to do road construction work for a Tibetan government-Chinese joint project and received Chinese wages in dayan coins.

**Q:**  Today we came here to examine how the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. སྡེ་ཡངས] One of the colleges in Drepung Monastery.">Deyang</a> colege's estates operated. Dr Goldstein is mainly doing research on the monastery and he will ask you questions. Dr. Goldstein is very good in Tibetan language and he is same as a Tibetan and he wrote on the history of Tibet. And he speaks Tibetan very well.   

**Q:**  What is your name?   

**A:**  My name is Pemba [Tib. སྤེན་པ].   

**Q:**  Do you have a family name?   

**A:**  I don't have any family name. This area was called Khotsang [Tib. kha tshang ?]. In the past, there used to be an oil extracting house here. That's why it is called Khotsang.   

**Q:**  Are you from here and were you born hear?   

**A:**  I was born here.   

**Q:**  Did you come here as a bride or did you take a bridegroom? How did you become a family here?   

**A:**  I was from this household. My father was the son of the household near the gorge [Tib. གས་པ] and my mother was born in <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. གཙང] One of the major sub-areas of Tibet that is located in southwest Tibet. Its main city is Shigatse.">Tsang</a> [Tib. གཙང]. My great grandfather was working on construction for the Tibetan government (Dewashung). My grandfather took my mother here when she was little. After that, my mother got together with my father and in the beginning they worked on a <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཁྲལ་རྐང] The name of the basic tax unit for arable land in traditional Tibetan society. Families with farm land would have one or more fields of different sizes, e.g., 1 tregang or 1/2 of a tregang. This was defined by a fixed number of khe of seed (tib. sönkhe) that would be sown on that field. For example, one tregang in some areas would consist of 10 sönkhe. There was substantial variation between and within regions and types of estates.">tregang</a> (tax unit of arable land). When they were unable to work the full tregang of land, they worked on a half tregang of land which was called nangchag [Tib. གནངས་ཆག]. For this, we had to work on alternative days. At that time, my parents had 4-5 children who were not grown up, so they hired a servant for the whole year. We also had to hire a servant at the harvest time to do the threshing called <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཉིས་སྐུལ] The name of a corvée tax that required sending a worker during the harvest and plowing periods.">nyikü</a> [Tib. ཉིས་སྐུལ].   

**Q:**  At that time, you were working on the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཁྲལ་རྐང] The name of the basic tax unit for arable land in traditional Tibetan society. Families with farm land would have one or more fields of different sizes, e.g., 1 tregang or 1/2 of a tregang.

There was substantial variation between and within regions and types of estates.">tregang</a>, right?   

**A:**  Yes, and our home was here. After that, I met my husband, so we got separated from my natal family and my mother made me to live here.   

**Q:**  Did you just get together (with no formal marrige ceremony) [Tib. ཁ་ཐུག] with your husband?   

**A:**  Yes, my husband's home is just down there and they were a <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཁྲལ་པ] The class of bound peasant/miser/serf households who held farmland and had to fulfill large corvée tax obligations to their manorial estates/lords. They are often called taxpayer households in English. While some of these were well off by local standards, many were poor due to a variety of factors such as heavy debts and a dearth of able-bodied workers in their households.">treba</a> household and we merged together here.   

**Q:**  You got settled here?   

**A:**  Yes.   

**Q:**  At that time, how old were you?   

**A:**  We were unable to work for the taxes because we didn't have <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. རྩམ་པ] The traditional Tibetan staple food that consists of grain that is roasted (popped), usually in heated sand, and then ground into a flour.">tsamba</a> to take when we had to go to work as <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. འུལ་ལག] A generic term for corvée labor that had to be performed for one&#x27;s manorial estate/lord without pay. One kind of ula required people to go and work and another kind required the provision of transportation animals.">ula</a> (corvée laborers). When we had a little tsamba, we went to work for the ula. So we missed work for 2-3 days. On the 4th of the 4th lunar month, all the people were going to Sangu [Tib. གསང་ཕུ] to burn incense and do prayers. On the 5th day, <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. སྐུ་ཞབས] A respectful term of address usually for monks, but also to show respect to a layman.">Kusho</a> Thupe la [Tib. སྐུ་ཞབས་ཐུབ་འཕེལ་ལགས] called all the household fathers (heads) of the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. མི་སེར] A term that can mean serf/bound subject as well as citizen, depending on context. For example, the miser of a lord would connote the bound subjects of that lord, whereas the miser of Tibet would connote citizens of Tibet.">miser</a> (bound peasants) and said that they are going to whip the two of us. At that time, the crops for which the seed had been taken as a loan had grown this high. We hadn't had any seed of our own. When we heard about the whipping, we were extremely afraid and we said we will hand over the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཁྲལ་རྐང] The name of the basic tax unit for arable land in traditional Tibetan society. Families with farm land would have one or more fields of different sizes, e.g., 1 tregang or 1/2 of a tregang.

There was substantial variation between and within regions and types of estates.">tregang</a> fields with the crop growing on it (on the fields), and then we handed over the tregang After that, we worked for the ula (corvée labor tax) called (Tib. དུཝ་ནམཏོང [དུ་བ་གནམ་གཏོང] where all the people sending smoke in the sky (ཨིཨེ, every household even those with no land) had to work for the tax. At that time, three households told us they want our tregang of land. There were three households who wanted that land. Therefore, we went to Sangu to ask divination from the oracle who went into trance. The divination came in favor of the old woman Tseten Drökar's [Tib. ཚེ་བརྟན་སྒྲོལ་དཀར] family. After that, my husband and I went to work on road building in Kongpo and also went to build the airport. At home, we didn't have anything and we had a baby who could hardly walk so we carried that baby and went to work on road building.   

**Q:**  So that was 1950s right?   

**A:**  Yes.   

**Q:**  Your mother came from <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. གཙང] One of the major sub-areas of Tibet that is located in southwest Tibet. Its main city is Shigatse.">Tsang</a>, right?   

**A:**  Yes.   

**Q:**  So who was your <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. དཔོན་པོ, མངའ་བདག] 1. A manorial estate holder. 2. Chief of an area.">lord</a>?   

**A:**  Our <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. དཔོན་པོ, མངའ་བདག] 1. A manorial estate holder. 2. Chief of an area.">lord</a> was Tashilhunpo.

**A:**  Yes, in Lhasa there was a person called (Tib. མིསེར་གོཔ [མི་སེར་འགོ་པ]) and also one called <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. བཅུ་དཔོན] 1. A minor officer in charge of a squad of 10 troops in the traditional Tibetan Army. 2. A minor official.">jugpön</a> who made us suffer a lot. He told me that I have to pay money for a replacement to do working on a construction project (Tib. ཨརདö [ཨར་དོད]) and many other things. My children hadn't grown up to be able to do the construction and I also didn't have money to pay the ardö (replacement fee) and I couldn't go to work. That's how the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. དཔོན་པོ, མངའ་བདག] 1. A manorial estate holder. 2. Chief of an area.">lord</a> made us suffer. I think that the jugpön made us to suffer and he came to our house in <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. གཙང] One of the major sub-areas of Tibet that is located in southwest Tibet. Its main city is Shigatse.">Tsang</a> saying he is going to take me to do the construction work though I was not grown up to work.

The peasants with human lease status still belonged to their lord and were required to pay an annual fee (&quot;human lease fee&quot;) to their lord. The children of human lease peasants inherited this status from parents of the same sex (i.e. sons of a male belonged to their father&#x27;s lord).">mibo</a> to Tashilunpo, right?   

**A:**  Yes. The <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. མི་བོགས] A status wherein a peasant &quot;leased&quot; his/her &quot;freedom&quot; from his/her lord to live and work where he/she wanted. The peasants with human lease status still belonged to their lord and were required to pay an annual fee (&quot;human lease fee&quot;) to their lord. The children of human lease peasants inherited this status from parents of the same sex (i.e. sons of a male belonged to their father&#x27;s lord).">mibo</a> was not that high. But at that time, I had to pay a lot of money for the replacement for the construction for Tashilunpo.   

**Q:**  You had to pay money for a replacement to work on construction if you couldn't go to work on the construction yourself, right?   

**A:**  Yes.   

**Q:**  On top of that you had to pay the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. མི་བོགས] A status wherein a peasant &quot;leased&quot; his/her &quot;freedom&quot; from his/her lord to live and work where he/she wanted.

**A:**  Yes.   

**Q:**  How many <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཁལ] A traditional volume measurement used for measuring grain in traditional Tibetan society.

**A:**  It was 25 <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཁལ] A traditional volume measurement used for measuring grain in traditional Tibetan society.

One kind of ula required people to go and work and another kind required the provision of transportation animals.">ula</a> worker every day?   

**A:**  Yes. We had to send one person everyday all year round. At the time of Wongkor [Tib. འོང་སྐོར] Festival when people carry scriptures around the field and during the New Year, we had three days off. They would send us to wash our hair on the 30th. If the shidü (estate manager) was good then he would give us a day off on the 3rd day. If the shidü was not good, then he would call us to work on 3rd day. It was also same for the Wongkor.   

**Q:**  At that time, did you have a day off on the 15th and 30th of the lunar month?   

**A:**  No, there was no day off.   

**Q:**  In autumn and spring you were doing farming, what did you do beside tha, when you had to go to work everyday, and what would you do during the winter and summer?   

**A:**  In summer, we have to do the weeding. And after that, they would send us to cut the incense which would be made into round shape. They would send us to cut incense for 10-11 days.   

**Q:**  When you went to cut the incense, how much did 1 person have to cut per day?   

**A:**  If we take our bedding and the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. གཞིས་ཀ] A manorial estate.">shiga</a> (estate) gave us a kind of beverage, we had to go to the mountains and had to cut 10 bundle of incense per day which was a big bundle, not like the small incense bundles in present days.   

**Q:**  For one person?   

**A:**  Yes. If you didn't take your bedding and came back in the evening, then you had to cut 5 bundles and take it to the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. གཞིས་ཀ] A manorial estate.">shiga</a> (estate).   

**Q:**  That was during the summer right?   

**A:**  Yes. After that, we have to collect firewood for the shiga.   

**Q:**  What kind of firewood did you have to collect? Was it cow dung?   

**A:**  No, we have to collect switches (twigs) [Tib. ཤིང་ཚག྄] for firewood.   

**Q:**  When you are saying accumulating switches that means you have to collect it because you were not allowed to cut the trees, right?   

**A:**  No, we had to cut the firewood. The place we went to cut the firewood belonged to the shiga.   

**Q:**  Can you cut the firewood from the tree?   

**A:**  No, the whole area belonged to the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. གཞིས་ཀ] A manorial estate.">shiga</a>, so we can go to collect the firewood anywhere. There are all different firewood like red colored called kyuruma [Tib. ?] and there are also black colored and we could cut whatever kind of switches we find.   

**Q:**  So you have to go to the mountain to collect the firewood, right?   

**A:**  We had to pull it out. After that, we had to cut the grass in the canal and the fields, and they would also make two people work carrying sickles, <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཉིས་སྐུལ] The name of a corvée tax that required sending a worker during the harvest and plowing periods.">nyikü</a> [Tib. ཉིས་སྐུལ].   

**Q:**  When would they start the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཉིས་སྐུལ] The name of a corvée tax that required sending a worker during the harvest and plowing periods.">nyikü</a> (threshing)?   

**A:**  The <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཉིས་སྐུལ] The name of a corvée tax that required sending a worker during the harvest and plowing periods.">nyikü</a> would start at the end of the 6th lunar month.   

**Q:**  How long would it take for the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཉིས་སྐུལ] The name of a corvée tax that required sending a worker during the harvest and plowing periods.">nyikü</a>?   

**A:**  It was until the threshing is over which was just before the New Year. We had to cut the grass in the fields and the canal. It would take a long time for the harvest, because there is large area of fields. The <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. མི་སེར] A term that can mean serf/bound subject as well as citizen, depending on context. For example, the miser of a lord would connote the bound subjects of that lord, whereas the miser of Tibet would connote citizens of Tibet.">miser</a> who don't have many people in their homes, they don't have time to work on their own tax land (Tib. ཏྲེཤིང [ཁྲལ་ཞིང]) and had to harvest the fields that belonged to the shiga.   

**Q:**  What did you do in winter?   

**A:**  In winter, we had to do the threshing for a very long time because at that time there were no machines. We had to depend on yak for doing the threshing (Tib. ཡགཆག [གཡག་ཆགས]) and sometimes it tooks about half a month. Threshing would take the whole winter and would be finished after the New Year. The quickest threshing would be over in the 12th lunar month. After the threshing, we had to take out the fertilizer to the fields.   

**Q:**  How many family members did you have?   

**A:**  I don't have family members.   

**Q:**  In the old society, how many family member did you have?   

**A:**  At that time, we had 8 family members, 6 children and the parents. I am the oldest child. After that, my parents died and I stayed for quite a long time working for the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. འུལ་ལག] A generic term for corvée labor that had to be performed for one&#x27;s manorial estate/lord without pay. One kind of ula required people to go and work and another kind required the provision of transportation animals.">ula</a> taxes. After I came here, the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཁྲལ་རྐང] The name of the basic tax unit for arable land in traditional Tibetan society. Families with farm land would have one or more fields of different sizes, e.g., 1 tregang or 1/2 of a tregang. This was defined by a fixed number of khe of seed (tib. sönkhe) that would be sown on that field. For example, one tregang in some areas would consist of 10 sönkhe. There was substantial variation between and within regions and types of estates.">tregang</a> of land was divided and we worked for 1/2 a tregang (nangchag).   

**Q:**  Did you divide the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཁྲལ་རྐང] The name of the basic tax unit for arable land in traditional Tibetan society. Families with farm land would have one or more fields of different sizes, e.g., 1 tregang or 1/2 of a tregang.

There was substantial variation between and within regions and types of estates.">tregang</a> by your own wish?   

**A:**  Yes, that was done by our wishe. We had to divide the land because we also had to divide the loans along with the land.   

**Q:**  Did you divide the household's <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཁྲལ་རྐང] The name of the basic tax unit for arable land in traditional Tibetan society. Families with farm land would have one or more fields of different sizes, e.g., 1 tregang or 1/2 of a tregang.

There was substantial variation between and within regions and types of estates.">tregang</a> and the loans or did the estate divide it?   

**A:**  The estate didn't do that. Usually, they would collect something called (Tib. göphü [Tib. བགོས་ཕུད])and they would take away quite a lot of things from the rich households, but when we got divided, since we were poor, we didn't have anything to collect.   

**Q:**  You said that in your family there were 8 members right?   

**A:**  Yes.   

**Q:**  So you stayed separate (from them) because you had your husband right?   

**A:**  Yes.   

**Q:**  So you took the land called nangchag right?   

**A:**  Yes.   

**Q:**  About you and your husband staying separate, you had discussed this with your family members, right?   

**A:**  In our home my mother and uncle didn't get along well. So the two of us lived separately. Therefore, we two were unable to work for the taxes, so we gave back the land with the crops growing and we worked as Duwa Namtong a kind of tax where all the people living in that area have to work.   

**Q:**  After you separated from your family, how long did you stay working half of the tax?   

**A:**  We stayed just for three year, and then we were unable to work for the tax.   

**Q:**  On the 3rd year you were unable to work for the tax and you handed over the land with the crops right?   

**A:**  Yes.   

**Q:**  After that, what did you do?   

**A:**  Then we worked doing the Duwa Namtong.   

**Q:**  This is a <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. དུད་ཆུང] Literally &quot;small smoke.&quot; A type of peasant/serf/miser in traditional Tibetan society that belonged to an estate/lord, but did not hold tax-base land (tib. ཁྲལ་རྟེན). They usually were poor and survived by working for others or leasing land from treba (taxpayer) households or sometimes from their estate.">düjung</a>, right?   

**A:**  Yes, and we stayed as a düjung. If you have a house from your parents, then you can stay there, but if you don't, then you have to ask for lodging. Then you don't have house and land but you have to work for Duwa Namtong because you eat the grass in the area and drink the water.   

**Q:**  I still don't understand what happened? Your father died and your mother moved with separately or what?   

**A:**  Since I got married, I had to stay separate from the main family which we did. We moved and we took half of the tax land. But we were not able to work doing the ulag tax so we returned the tax land.   

**Q:**  To whom did you return the tax land? Did you return the land to the estate or your family?   

**A:**  We returned it to the estate. The estate (shiga) gave the tax land to a person who was able to do the ulag work for it. According to the policy, it was not allowed to hand over or take the land with the crops, but we had to hand it over because they almost beat us up, so we gave the land.   

**Q:**  When she got married were there other children in home?   

**A:**  Her family had several children and she was the oldest one. When she got together with her husband, then she have to separate from the main family and left behind her parent and brothers and sisters.   

**Q:**  How did they decide on giving half of the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཁྲལ་རྐང] The name of the basic tax unit for arable land in traditional Tibetan society.

**A:**  She talked with her parents and they decided and she didn't interfere. When they divided the family, they didn't have anything to offer, otherwise if they had something, then they would have to do göpu which they didn't get because they had nothing. Since she and her husband were living together here, they took the half of the tregang.   

**Q:**  Why they couldn't they do the ulag? What was the difficulty?   

**A:**  Remember she told us that together with the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཁྲལ་རྐང] The name of the basic tax unit for arable land in traditional Tibetan society. Families with farm land would have one or more fields of different sizes, e.g., 1 tregang or 1/2 of a tregang.

There was substantial variation between and within regions and types of estates.">tregang</a> of land, there were loans on that land.   

**Q:**  You and your husband kept the (half) <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཁྲལ་རྐང] The name of the basic tax unit for arable land in traditional Tibetan society. Families with farm land would have one or more fields of different sizes, e.g., 1 tregang or 1/2 of a tregang.

What was the main reason that you couldn't work on the tregang?   

**A:**  At that time, we didn't have <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. རྩམ་པ] The traditional Tibetan staple food that consists of grain that is roasted (popped), usually in heated sand, and then ground into a flour.">tsamba</a> to take (when they went to work) and since we have just two people, nobody would give us a loan. When we had a little tsamba, then we went to work for the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. འུལ་ལག] A generic term for corvée labor that had to be performed for one&#x27;s manorial estate/lord without pay. One kind of ula required people to go and work and another kind required the provision of transportation animals.">ula</a>g tax and when we didn't have tsamba, then we stayed because we couldn't work on an empty stomach, right? Therefore, the shidü (estate steward) said if you are unable to work for the ula tax then you can return the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཁྲལ་རྐང] The name of the basic tax unit for arable land in traditional Tibetan society.

It was like the proverb, "the crows waiting for the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. གཏོར་མ] A ritual offering made from tsamba and water.">torma</a> offering." [Tib. ཕོ་རོག་གཏོར་མ་སྒུག་པ] So we returned the tregang. At that time, we had to return the tregang otherwise they were about to whip us [for not doing the ula work].   

**Q:**  When you separated from your family you took half of the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཁྲལ་རྐང] The name of the basic tax unit for arable land in traditional Tibetan society.

There was substantial variation between and within regions and types of estates.">tregang</a>, so with that, how much loans did your family ask you to take?   

**A:**  My family ask me to take 300 <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཁལ] A traditional volume measurement used for measuring grain in traditional Tibetan society. Sizes of this unit varied somewhat, but the official government khe (called mkhar ru or bstan dzin mkha ru) weighed about 28-31 pounds for barley. It was used to convey the size of fields. For example, a field said to be 10 khe in size meant that 10 khe of seed could be sown on that field.">khe</a> of grain loans with half of the tregang.   

**Q:**  What happened when you returned the land with the loan? How did you do the loan?   

**A:**  We worked for other people and paid quite a lot of the loan.   

**Q:**  Wait a minute. Did you owe 300 <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཁལ] A traditional volume measurement used for measuring grain in traditional Tibetan society.

**A:**  We didn't owe the loan to the shiga. We had to pay the loan to big households like Lasampa [Tib.?], Ganden Shartse [Tib. དགའ་ལྡན་ཤར་རྩེ], Kündeling [Tib. ཀུན་བདེ་གླིང] and other internal households [Tib. ནང་ཁུལ]. At first, our parents took the loan from wherever they could get it because they couldn't raise their children. Later, I was the oldest child in the house. So they divided the tax land together with the loan.   

**Q:**  So there was no connection between the 300 <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཁལ] A traditional volume measurement used for measuring grain in traditional Tibetan society.

There was substantial variation between and within regions and types of estates.">tregang</a> that you got?   

**A:**  We took the loans because we had to put seed on the farmland. Therefore, we had to take the loan.   

**Q:**  Okay you have the half of the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཁྲལ་རྐང] The name of the basic tax unit for arable land in traditional Tibetan society.

The loan was left over with the two of you, right?   

**A:**  Yes, you are right.   

**Q:**  Therefore, did you get the chance to pay off the loan?   

**A:**  We paid it quite well.   

**Q:**  How much loan did you pay off before the liberation?   

**A:**  Before the liberation, we paid about half of it. After we lost the tax land we went to do road building in Kongpo. And we exchanged the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ད་ཡང; ch. 大洋] A Chinese silver dollar that had the image of Yuan Shikai on its face. It was used by the Chinese government in Tibet in the 1950s because Tibetans did not accept Chinese paper currency.">dayan</a> coins in Lhasa and for Tibetan copper coins which we loaded on a donkey and we paid the loan to the Ganden Shartse [Tib. དགའ་ལྡན་ཤར་རྩེ] College.

We had to find <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. རྩམ་པ] The traditional Tibetan staple food that consists of grain that is roasted (popped), usually in heated sand, and then ground into a flour.">tsamba</a> by ourselves and had to remain half full and half hungry. We didn't have the chance to touch a bag load of tsamba year round. One person had to work for the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. འུལ་ལག] A generic term for corvée labor that had to be performed for one&#x27;s manorial estate/lord without pay.

**Q:**  Was that a sideline work?   

**A:**  Yes, it is like a sideline work in present days. At that time, the main livelihood depended on the mountains from where we got such things as cow dung which we sold and bought the worst quality <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. རྩམ་པ] The traditional Tibetan staple food that consists of grain that is roasted (popped), usually in heated sand, and then ground into a flour.">tsamba</a> that was called called kamsog [Tib. སྐམ་སོག]. It looked like powdered donkey dung. We had only one donkey so we loaded two loads of cow dung on the donkey and we had to carry two loads on our backs and sell them. That's how we spent our lives. Sometimes, we didn't find the red inferior tsamba so we bought the Torma offerings from the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཇོ་ཁང] A most famous temple in Lhasa that houses a holy statue of the Buddha.

**Q:**  At that time, when you were working for the alternating day ulatax, how many <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཁལ] A traditional volume measurement used for measuring grain in traditional Tibetan society. Sizes of this unit varied somewhat, but the official government khe (called mkhar ru or bstan dzin mkha ru) weighed about 28-31 pounds for barley. It was used to convey the size of fields. For example, a field said to be 10 khe in size meant that 10 khe of seed could be sown on that field.">khe</a> of land did you plant?   

**A:**  It was 12 <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཁལ] A traditional volume measurement used for measuring grain in traditional Tibetan society.

That was like the capital, but we could only plant one or two fields because we didn't have the capability. So other people were telling us to lease the land. We had only one or two fields we were planting plant. And when we planted the fields, we had to ask <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. སྡེ་ཡངས] One of the colleges in Drepung Monastery.">Deyang</a> Tratsang for a loan. Even though we were the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. མི་སེར] A term that can mean serf/bound subject as well as citizen, depending on context. For example, the miser of a lord would connote the bound subjects of that lord, whereas the miser of Tibet would connote citizens of Tibet.">miser</a> of the College, they wouldn't give us a loan because we were not capable and we had only two people (workers in their household). They would just lend us only 2-3 khe. They would lend the good households amounts like 20-30 khe. So we just used a little bit for the seeds for planting, and that's how we spent our lives. On the 4th of the 6th lunar month, all the Deyang Tratsang's miser have to go to the mountains to collect firewood for 12-15 days. We had to take our bedding to the mountains. When we went to the mountains we didn't have <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. རྩམ་པ] The traditional Tibetan staple food that consists of grain that is roasted (popped), usually in heated sand, and then ground into a flour.">tsamba</a> to take, so we asked for a 4 day leave from the work supervisor [Tib. ལས་དཔོན] to prepare tsamba. He said, "That will be fine. You can prepare your tsamba and come back to work later to make up the 4 days that you missed. Then we also had to bring the firewood to the estate. Then after two days, they were saying that I didn't come to work for the corvée <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. འུལ་ལག] A generic term for corvée labor that had to be performed for one&#x27;s manorial estate/lord without pay.

Families with farm land would have one or more fields of different sizes, e.g., 1 tregang or 1/2 of a tregang.

There was substantial variation between and within regions and types of estates.">tregang</a> holders (on the estate), you two are disgraceful. It is like the proverb, "among the 8 Namse wealth deity riders, there is one disgraceful deity walking [Tib. རྣམ་སྲས་རྟ་བདག་བརྒྱད་ལ་ཞབས་འདྲེན་རྐང་ཐང་གཅིག]. At that time, I was young. I went to the roof of the house. He was coming after me and I thought of jumping from the roof. He told me to come back. After that, I didn't come back, but he didn't follow me. So he stayed right there. If he had come towards me I had thought of jumping off it. Then he said come here, but I didn't go because I thought If I went there he might beat me up. After that, he said, "From tomorrow you don't need to come to work for the corvée tax and we are going to take your tregang of land back because there are many people waiting for the land. It is like the proverb, "the crows waiting for the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. གཏོར་མ] A ritual offering made from tsamba and water.">torma</a> offering."

That was on the 5th or 6th of the 6th month.   

**Q:**  At that time, how old were you?   

**A:**  At that time, I was 29 years old [1959]. At that time, the crops had grown this high. On the next day, they told the work supervisors not to make us work and sent us back and they also told us it will not be okay if you go to work any more. In that year, we had gotten quite good amount of loan so we had planted 8-9 fields and the crops were also good. Then they took over the land with crops [Tib. སྔོ་ཐོག] growing on it. Some people were saying that even in other countries, if some one took over the land with crops on it, it is like killing the people.

This large administrative unit was headed by one or two district heads (tib. dzongpön [རྫོང་དཔོན]) appointed by the Tibetan government. Typically there was one lay official and one monk official who were jointly sent from Lhasa for three year terms. They were responsible for collecting taxes and adjudicating disputes in their district. These dzong were equivalent to counties (ch. 县) in the current Chinese system of administration.">dzong</a> (district) and they will help me on that. I told them that if I report it to the dzong, they might beat me up. I thought it would be better to become a Duwa Namtong and go to the mountains to collect something and sell that in Lhasa so I said I can't make an appeal to the dzong because I don't have <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. རྩམ་པ] The traditional Tibetan staple food that consists of grain that is roasted (popped), usually in heated sand, and then ground into a flour.">tsamba</a> to eat. One of the household heads was saying, "if you could bear the beating, then there would be no problem. Can you bear the beating? I said I can bear beatings 5-6 times. I don't think they will beat me all day long because I didn't lie and steal. I had been beaten with switches when I was in the monastery. Anyhow, they took over my land and handed it over to the other households. After that, we became like dead people. We didn't go to work for the corvée <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. འུལ་ལག] A generic term for corvée labor that had to be performed for one&#x27;s manorial estate/lord without pay. One kind of ula required people to go and work and another kind required the provision of transportation animals.">ula</a> tax. After that, I went to the mountains to collect cow dung. Then the People's Liberation Army started the road construction at the Kuru [Tib. ཀུ་རུ] Bridge. At that time, the Chinese and the Tibetan government (dewashung) both made us work. <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. སྡེ་ཡངས] One of the colleges in Drepung Monastery.">Deyang</a> estate (shiga) had to send one person so I went to work on the road construction and my wife stayed home. They collected the 3 <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. བྲེ] A unit of traditional volume measurement [a container] in Tibet, 20 of which typically equaled one khe or bo [also a container], although in some areas there were only 16 dre in one khe.">dre</a> of tsamba, and little bit of flour, butter and tea leaves from the people here (since he was going on behalf of the estate's obligation). I went to do the road construction and I stayed there for three months.   

**Q:**  Did they consider working on the construction as the work done by the Duwa Namtong for the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. སྡེ་ཡངས] One of the colleges in Drepung Monastery.">Deyang</a> Shiga or not?   

**A:**  Yes, it would be considered as work of the estate (shiga). After three months when I came back, I had received a good salary and I got quite a good amount of <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ད་ཡང; ch. 大洋] A Chinese silver dollar that had the image of Yuan Shikai on its face. It was used by the Chinese government in Tibet in the 1950s because Tibetans did not accept Chinese paper currency.">dayan</a> silver coins and some extra <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. རྩམ་པ] The traditional Tibetan staple food that consists of grain that is roasted (popped), usually in heated sand, and then ground into a flour.">tsamba</a> to carry. I also worked very hard. From that time on, by the grace of the Communist Party, our livelihood got better, like a sick person walking with a cane. We also went to mountains in winter. At that time, we had one child who was about 6 years old. Then we went to Kongpo for the road construction.   

**Q:**  Going to Kongpo was also included in this same construction project, right??   

**A:**  Yes.
