**Q:**  Where were you living in 1949-50? The time when
               Chamdo was lost.  

**A:**  I was living in Lhasa.   

**Q:**  What were you doing at that time?   

**A:**  At that time, I was working in the Yigtsang
               Office. That was the time when Chamdo was lost.   

**Q:**  In 1949, weren't the Chinese talking about
               liberating Tibet on the radio?   

**A:**  Yes, they were saying that.   

**Q:**  What was the thinking at that time in Lhasa? Were
               the people thinking that it would really happen?   

**A:**  Yes. They were thinking from the radio that the
               communists are going to liberate Tibet. When the people in Lhasa heard about that,
               not only the people, but the situation was tense for the Tibetan Government also and
               they set up a radio broadcast station and invited Sri Ford [to operate it]. The
               government was giving whatever answer should be given to the Chinese side on the
               radio broadcast. At that time, the foreigner Ford was an educated
               person, so he gave all the instructions and the Kashag discussed that and they gave
               the answers. At that time, all the people who had radios knew about that. At that
               time, Rasa Gyagen [Tib. ra sa rgya rgan] was the radio announcer.   

**Q:**  Was he in Nagchu at that time?   

**A:**  He was in Lhasa and he announced on the radio
               from the Magar Sarpa [Tib. dmag sgar gsar pa] ("New Military Headquarters"). That
               place used to be the Regimental Headquarters of the Jadang or the Tadang regiment of
               the Tibetan Government. At that time, the soldiers had gone [returned home], so the
               radio station was set up in that place.   

**Q:**  When the Chinese came to Chamdo, Lhalu was there,
               right?   

**A:**  Yes.   

**Q:**  At that time, the troops sent to defend were
               still there, right?   

**A:**  Yes.   

**Q:**  At that time, did they send any special
               [soldiers] from the Tibetan Government?   

**A:**  Yes. They were sending special troops to Chamdo,
               and they had sent the army soldiers and the monk soldiers as far as Lharigo, but then
               they didn't need to go down further [as Chamdo was lost].   

**Q:**  At that time, there were monk soldiers [Tib. ser
               dmag], right?   

**A:**  Yes. They were not only from Sera, but probably
               from all three monasteries [around Lhasa].   

**Q:**  Was that after Chamdo was lost?   

**A:**  The preparations were done before Chamdo was
               lost. Before that, when they were talking a lot about the liberation [of Tibet], the
               dugö [Tib. 'du 'god] economic management system was set up [in the Tibetan
               government]. That was a kind of economic reform. The leader [Tib. gtso 'dzin] was
               Surkhang. They printed the three sang coin [Tib. srang gsum sgor mo] to pay the
               salary and the expenses of the military.   

**Q:**  Did they set up the dugö office because of the
               danger from the Chinese side?   

**A:**  Yes. It was set up for economic purposes. When
               there was the serious danger from the Chinese, the Tibetan Government recruited the
               Drongdrag [Tib. grong drag] ("Better Family") regiment and so forth. At that time,
               all of the soldiers were in Lhasa and they were trained there. Probably, there were
               about 10,000 soldiers. They were doing a lot of preparations. For that, they need
               financial sources for their salary. And if the war took place, we needed financial
               sources like money and grain. At that time, the people were
               thinking that there would be trouble, because the Tibetan Government was in a tense
               situation and doing many things according to the situation like giving harsh answers
               to the Chinese. When the Chinese were saying that they are going to liberate Tibet,
               the Tibetan Government announced on the radio, "If the Chinese come on our soil we
               will fight till the men are killed and only the women are left [Tib. pho zad mo thug]
               and [we will fight] till the hands are cut off and only the shoulders are left [Tib.
               lag zad dpung thug].   

**Q:**  I saw in Taktse Rimpoche's book that when he came
               to Lhasa, people told him not to talk like that [saying that the Chinese will
               attack]. They thought that the Chinese would never come because the statues of the
               Buddha and Avalokitesvara in Jokhang and the three great monasteries were still
               there. Therefore, nothing will happen. When I asked my father [Tsarong Rimshi] who
               was then in Drigung where they had recognized [his son as] the reincarnation of the
               Drigung Lama, he said that the people in Drigung were not at all nervous and afraid
               of the situation. That's why I am asking you about the thinking of people. In the
               historical record the Chinese had come to Tibet and then had gone back. What were the
               people thinking? Did they burn incense? How did the monk soldiers come? Did they
               decide by themselves to go?   

**A:**  No, the government recruited and organized them.
               At that time, the government restored the size of the incomplete regiments and added
               a lot of new soldiers. And they were trained for a couple of months. Anyway, at that
               time, the Tibetan Government was supposed to oppose [Tib. ya lan] the Chinese. At that time, the Tibetans were kind of stubborn [Tib. lkugs pa dbu
               tshugs] and didn't know about the foreign countries. Actually, the higher authorities
               knew about the foreigners, but the subordinates were thinking that we have quite a
               lot of soldiers and they are quite courageous and they will do quite well. Actually,
               it was impossible to cope with the Chinese, but the people were not saying that and
               they were planning to fight. But, when Chamdo was lost, all of a
               sudden, people were not at all planning to fight. Therefore, according to the thought
               of the Dalai Lama, it was decided to accept [Tib. gtan 'khel] the 17-Point Agreement.
               After that, all the people became kind of calm or relaxed [Tib. lhing 'jags]. That
               was strange. Chamdo was lost and the Agreement was signed. Hence we had to listen to
               whatever the Chinese said and there wasn't any chance to insist on something with the
                  Chinese. As for the Taktse Rimpoche's book, at that time Taktse
               Rimpoche was sent by the Chinese to talk with the Tibetan Government. Whether they
               were calling it peaceful or liberation, actually it was because he was the brother of
               the Dalai Lama. Therefore, the person who came along to talk could only do like that
               since it was not right for him to cause a war. The only thing he could say was "It
               would be better to sign the peaceful agreement."   

**Q:**  Some people were saying that there were about
               20,000 monk soldiers, but when they arrived at Lharigo, there were only about 70 of
               them left, was that correct?   

**A:**  Probably, it was like that.   

**Q:**  Do you have any idea about the number of monk
               soldiers?   

**A:**  I don't know the number.   

**Q:**  Probably, they were all volunteers from the
               different Monastic colleges, right?   

**A:**  Yes. Internally they might be volunteers, but
               basically the government recruited them. So the colleges divided the amount of monk
               soldiers [that were asked for] among the colleges and it became like a tax. If there
               were volunteers, they could come out as volunteers, but when the situation came to
               the critical point, it became like a tax. In olden days, the monk
               soldiers of Sera attacked the Chinese when they were staying at the sand dune area
               below Sera Monastery. So they came down and fought with the Chinese. But this time
               the situation was not the same as they needed horses because we didn't have vehicles.
               So it would cause a severe hardship for the miser (serfs) when the soldiers would
               travel [they would have to provide corvée animals). At that time we didn't even have
               a cart pulled by horses. If we had carts, one cart could carry 15-16 people.   

**Q:**  In 1950's when the Chinese were coming, at that
               moment, the Dalai Lama took the religious and political responsibility. At that time,
               probably, he sent a letter to China in which it was written, "During the time of the
               regents, the friendship between the Chinese and the Tibetans declined, but now I am
               going to restore the friendship." At that point, I heard that the Chinese policy
               implemented in Chamdo and those places became a little bit more relaxed or lenient.
               After the Dalai Lama took the religious and the political responsibility, how was the
               situation in Lhasa? Did the situation become sort of different? Or did the people
               show solidarity?   

**A:**  At that time, Nechung and Gadong [Tib. dga'
               gdong], the two protector deities, prophesied that it would be beneficial if the
               regent offered the religious and the political power to the Dalai Lama. At that time,
               Nechung prophesied, "I told you earlier that you should offer the religious and the
               political power to the Dalai Lama. Now it is the time to offer him the power." But it
               was said that they kind of delayed, saying that the Dalai Lama hadn't finished his
               religious studies. Nechung just prophesied once and later he didn't prophecy again
               because they didn't put into action what he had prophesied in the past. Actually, among the deities, Nechung had the political
               responsibility to prophecy because he was said to be the political protection deity.
               So if they had offered the power earlier, it might have had a result. But they didn't
               offer the power. If they offered the power, the regent would not have had the power.
               The kudrak did something internally and delayed the offering of the power. In between that, there was a lot of talk about Kapshöba [Tib. ka
               shod pa] and those people. I am not sure whether it was false or true. So I am
               leaving those talks aside and in short, the situation became very tense. At that
               time, when they asked Nechung for a prophecy again, Nechung said, "I have already
               told you earlier that you should offer [the Dalai Lama] the power." After that, when
               they asked the protector deity Gadong for a prophecy, Gadong said, "It is the time
               for my savior [the Dalai Lama] to take the religious and political power [Tib. nga yi
               mgon por rgyal bstan chab srid kyi skabs bab yod]. So you should offer the power as
               soon as possible and ask Nechung again for a prophecy." At that
               moment, it was just after Nechung had given the prophecy. But when they asked him to
               go into trance again and they asked Nechung again for the prophecy, Nechung said, "As
               Gadong has told you, it is the time to offer the religious and the political power to
               the Dalai Lama. I told you earlier, but you didn't put that into action." Then, they
               offered the power soon after that. They didn't have any choice but to do that because
               the Chinese had arrived at Chamdo. When the regent offered the
               responsibility to the Dalai Lama, the people's dislike of the regent calmed down a
               little bit. This was because all people loved the Dalai Lama very much. Since then,
               people reported political matters to the Dalai Lama instead of the regent. So all
               people were united together and they were saying what would be the best to do [Tib.
               gang drag ci drag]. They were not only just talking, they were doing something.   

**Q:**  After that, it was said that it would not be good
               for the Dalai Lama to stay in Lhasa and he went to Yadong with the Kashag, right?   

**A:**  Yes.   

**Q:**  At that time, probably, there were Shakabpa and
               Taring [Tib. phreng ring], who went to Delhi to hold talks as representatives. I
               heard at that time that one group of people said that it would be good for the Dalai
               Lama to stay in India and another group said that it would be good to go back. Do you
               know what people were thinking at first when the Dalai Lama went to Yadong?  

**A:**  I don't know. At that time, regarding the matter
               of whether he went to Yadong without any problem or people said something about that,
               they held meetings and among the Tibetan Government officials, some of them said that
               he should go and some said he shouldn't go. Some of them were saying, "If he leaves,
               the country would become kind of empty" and it was also dangerous at that time. Finally, people talked a lot about the danger to the Dalai Lama
               saying, "If the Chinese come all of a sudden and we couldn't stop them, it would be
               dangerous." And some people said "For the purpose of politics, it would be good to go
               for a short time because the Chinese would keep watch on the Dalai Lama and if he
               stays at the border it would be easy to go out [of Tibet] if necessary. If he stays
               in Lhasa, it would not be easy to go out." The Tibetans were a little bit smarter
               than other people and they were not idiots. ....   

**Q:**  What was your thinking at that time? You were in
               the Yigtsang Office, right?   

**A:**  Yes. I was in the Yigtsang Office and we were
               talking about what I mentioned above. When people explained and said that it would be
               good to stay, I was also thinking it might be a good idea. When people said it would
               be good to go, I also thought that might be a good idea. At that time, I was young. I
               was in my twenties so I didn't have any kind of special thoughts. At that time, I was
               not capable and I was doing whatever the other people were doing.   

**Q:**  As I mentioned above, when the Dalai Lama was in
               Yadong, there were two groups and one of them said that it would be good to go and
               the other said that it would be good to come back, right?   

**A:**  Yes, it happened a little bit like that. At that
               time, when the Chinese heard that the Dalai Lama was in Yadong, the Chinese withdrew
               their troops a little bit. That was because they thought that he might go abroad. At that time, the Chinese had arrived at Chamdo and the main
               Commander [Tib. dmag dpon] Zhang Guohua came long after they took Chamdo. Wang Qimei
               came earlier. He was also one of the commanders. He was a short guy. He was one of
               the officers who took Chamdo and he was the main Commander-in Chief [Ch. si ling
               yuan] of Chamdo. I heard that when Wang Qimei noticed that the Dalai Lama went to
               Yadong, he cried and said, "The Dalai Lama has had to face severe hardships.
               Actually, he doesn't need to go to Yadong." While saying that he cried and showed an
               appearance of having a deep faith towards the Dalai Lama. Probably, he really cried.
               People were talking about that. Though he was the Commander-in-Chief, look at him!
               How deceitful was [Tib. g.yo] he? No matter whether he cried or not, the Dalai Lama
               went to Yadong and stayed there. At that time, Wang Qimei was
               accumulating soldiers and preparing for [fighting]. Then the Dalai Lama sent letters
               to the Chinese from Yadong and the Chinese agreed to the peaceful Agreement and the
               Dalai Lama sent representatives from Yadong and there were also representatives from
               Chamdo. At that time, the Chinese didn't come up [to Lhasa]. They were gathering
               soldiers in Chamdo.   

**Q:**  I heard that when they were talking about the
               agreement, the Chinese talked very severely about the recognition of the Panchen
               Lama. What did you hear about that?   

**A:**  I didn't know about that. At that time, they
               didn't make any kind of announcement. They just said that in Beijing, probably,
               Tashilhunpo was one of the reasons for the Chinese saying that they are going to
               liberate Tibet. Because they [Tashilhunpo] didn't like the Tibetan Government and
               they wanted to take revenge. Therefore, they surrendered to the
               Chinese and they were staying permanently in China and both of the [Panchen Lama's]
               dzasa were capable. So they did this and that and kind of opposed the Tibetan
               Government and repeatedly requested that the Chinese liberate Tibet saying that that
               would be good for them. So, the Chinese thought that it would be good if they could
               annex [Tib. za] Tibet and they said that the Tibetan Government should treat the
               Panchen Lama well. Otherwise, there wasn't any reason to say that.   

**Q:**  The Panchen Lama came to Lhasa in 1952, right? At
               that time, the Dalai Lama had already arrived back from Yadong and Zhang Jingwu also
               had arrived at Lhasa, right?   

**A:**  Yes. That was the first time he came to Lhasa.   

**Q:**  At that time, there was a lot of trouble
               regarding the manner of the meeting with the Dalai Lama, e.g., the height of the
               throne and so on, right? I read in a Chinese book that the Kashag and Nangmagang had
               an internal talk about the Panchen Lama standing near the throne of the Dalai Lama.
               Later, the Tibetan Government didn't agree to do that and made the height of the
               thrones very different. Actually, what happened at that time?   

**A:**  Yes. The Panchen Lama came by air up to the Dam
               [Tib. 'dam] Airport and then he sat in a car and came up to the bottom of Shugula
               Pass [Tib. shog bu la]. At that time, I was in Yangpajen. The vehicles could pass up
               to the bottom of the Shugula mountain pass. At that time, the highway was not built
               on the mountain pass, so he had to ride horses from Shugula up to Shigatse. At that time, the Tibetan Government said that the Panchen Lama is
               coming and they appointed Thönpa [Tib. thon pa] Khenjung and a Rimshi [Tib. rim
               bzhi], a fourth rank lay official, as the liaison officer [Tib. sne shen]. Two
               liaison officers came to Yangpajen. I was told to prepare horses and pack animals for
               the attendants and the soldiers. When I asked how could I find so many horses in
               Yangpajen the Kashag sent an order for me to collect horses also from Namru [Tib.
               gnam ru] and Nyemo. These three districts should cooperate and provide the horses.
               After that, we consulted about dividing the number of horses that needed to be
               provided between the districts. At that time, the liaison officers
               put up tents for the Panchen Lama. We also had to supply fuel and other things that
               they needed. We also appointed representatives and supplied firewood and dung. We
               borrowed some tents called Gari gonag [Tib. dkar ri mgo nag]. They were tents with
               black top and white sides and we also put yak hair tents up around the others.
               Actually, the yak hair tents were for making fire (cooking). Tashilhunpo also brought
               a lot of tents from Shigatse because that was the first reception site [Tib. phebs
               bsu dang po]. They put up a tent for the Panchen Lama and a tent for holding
               ceremonies. They put tents around those tents for the soldiers and the cadres. At
               that time, I was able to successfully do the work of receiving the Panchen Lama. At that time they held a simple kind of ceremony where the Yangjen
               Gopa [Tib. yangs jan 'go pa] and the liaison officers and some minor tsodrag
               officials had an audience with the Panchen Lama. I saw that the Panchen Lama was
               sitting on a throne. We offered the Mendredensum and we
               were served tea and rice mixed with butter and sweet potatoes. At
               that time, the horses and mules for the Panchen Lama were brought from Shigatse, but
               we supplied the horses for the soldiers and the attendants. There was also a person
               in charge of the horses and the pack animals called the Takhe Dodampa [Tib. rta khe
               do dam pa] so we consulted with him and made the arrangement for the horses and the
               pack animals. At that time, the Chinese were surprised to see that
               we provided the tents, horses and the pack animals for the Panchen Lama and they
               asked why the Panchen Lama didn't go to Lhasa. We told them, "Lhasa is the place for
               the Dalai Lama and the Tibetan Government and the Panchen Lama had his own monastery
               in Shigatse. There's is a relationship between a Lama and the government." But, since
               the Panchen Lama is a Lama, the Tibetan Government told us to provide all of those
               things. Then the Chinese asked whether these people are the miser (serfs) of the
               Panchen Lama. We told them these people are the miser of the Tibetan Government. The
               reason for the Chinese being surprised might be because the people of Tashilhunpo
               might have told them that Tibet belonged to them. At that time, the
               people in that area were not showing the appearance that they were the miser (serfs)
               of Panchen Lama. When we told the Chinese the truth, they believed us a little bit
               and they also knew a little bit. On the next day, Panchen Lama rode a horse and went
               to Markyang [Tib. mar rkyang] where the second reception was arranged. And then he
               arrived at Shigatse. After staying for quite a long time in Shigatse, he went to
               Lhasa to have an audience with the Dalai Lama. At that time, the
               highway was built. So he just traveled by car and didn't stop at Yangpajen. When the
               Panchen Lama came to Lhasa, the Tibetan Government received him and entertained him
               in the room called Nangsi [Tib. snang srid] in the Jokhang. After that, the Panchen
               Lama had to go to have an audience with the Dalai Lama in the Potala Palace. It was
               the official ceremony for meeting him [Tib. gsar 'jal]. Before the
               Panchen Lama came to meet the Dalai Lama, the Chinese said a lot of troublesome [Tib.
               rnyog dra] things to the Kashag such as saying that the thrones should be placed the
               same height. They said that they want to follow the position mentioned in the
               Agreement about the relation between the 13th Dalai Lama and the 9th Panchen Lama. At that time, the Kashag didn't accept what the Chinese said and
               they had to consult about that matter. Later, the Kashag held meetings and said that
               it was not mentioned in our documents that the Dalai Lama and the Panchen Lama should
               have the thrones of the same height. So that would be impossible because the Panchen
               Lama has never been seated above the Dalai Lama. In the past, the
               Panchen Lama had been the tutor of the Dalai Lama and also the regent during the
               absence of the Dalai Lama. So the Kashag told them that it would not be right to have
               the thrones the same height. At that time, from the Tashilhunpo
               side, they were inciting the Chinese hard and insisted saying that they want the
               thrones at the same height. At that time, the Tibetan Government became the opponent
               of the Chinese and the Panchen Lama became the inciter of the Chinese. Finally, I
               heard that it was decided that both of them shall sit on chairs of the same height
               and meet each other.   

**Q:**  Sitting on the same [height] chairs?   

**A:**  Yes, probably, they sat on chairs facing each
               other. Actually on that day, they had to serve tea and rice to the attendants of the
               Panchen Lama. According to the custom, they would put common cushions and a rug near
               the Yigtsang and make them sit down and serve tea and rice. There was no custom for
               sitting on chairs like foreigners. On that day, the morning monk
               official tea ceremony, the Drungja was held outside and the audience
               was granted during that ceremony. At that time, we were at the morning tea ceremony
               drinking tea. When the Panchen Lama came to have his audience inside the room of the
               Dalai Lama, his soldiers accompanied him up to the door of the room in formation. His soldiers were holding guns and standing from the door of the
               room down to the stairs while the meeting ceremony was going on inside the room.
               Actually, they shouldn't have stood like that, but it was inconvenient to tell them
               not to stand there. They were just standing there like bullying [Tib. dbang yod] us.
               They were standing there and we were sitting there drinking tea just near to them.
               The morning tea ceremony was held at the east side [Tib. shar rgyud] of the Potala
               Palace. Usually, it would be held in the west side, but for the Panchen Lama, they
               held it on the east side. At that time, the Panchen Lama went in
               and offered the Mendredensum to the Dalai Lama and sat on the chair. After the tea
               and rice were served, probably the Dalai Lama invited him in his private room and
               served him a meal and two of them sat down like sitting in their own private
                  rooms. Actually the attendants should be served tea and rice,
               but they kept on standing there and didn't sit on the cushions where tea and rice
               would be served. So nobody served them tea. At that time, the attendants were showing
               the appearance that they were great and stood there all the time, so the tea was not
               served for them because people felt kind of uneasy.  At that time,
               the soldiers were standing amidst the officials attending the morning ceremony. So it
               was kind of a bad appearance. But, nobody fought or pulled them down and told them
               not to stand up. They were just left like this. After the ceremony the attendants
               went back with the Panchen Lama.
