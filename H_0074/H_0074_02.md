### Tape 2  
**A:**  This is just about the general situation. Nowadays, Deng Xiaoping is talking about "The big atmosphere and the small atmosphere [Tib. gnam gshis che ba dang gnam gshis chung ba]." Actually, he meant to say to look at the situation from a wider perspective or from a narrower perspective. I think when we analyze liberating Tibet at the beginning, we will get a deeper understanding if we can analyze it with the situation of the whole world and of the nationwide situation.  In 1953, when Zhang Guohua came to Tibet, in general, the work style of the Communist Party was that when they arrived at a place, the most important thing was to inquire about the nature of the society of the local place. Chairman Mao had been analyzing the society of the PRC. The nature of the society in Tibet was confirmed in 1953 through discussion.   

**Q:**  Did they hold the discussion in Tibet or in Beijing?   

**A:**  They investigated in Tibet and the meeting was held in Beijing. I heard that Chairman Mao called historical experts and discussed what the nature of Tibetan society was. At the end of this, the experts confirmed that it was a serf system [Tib. zhing bran lam lugs]. Chairman Mao had said, "The miser [of Tibet] were neither in accordance with the nature of the trenyog [hereditary servants] nor the miser who had the freedom." So when we look at it, it was probably a serf system. It was similar to the social nature in China at the time of the "The Spring and Autumn Period (770-476 B.C) [Ch. chun qiu zhan guo]." This was very important.   

**Q:**  When did he say that?   

**A:**  He said it in 1953.   

**Q:**  When was that Spring and Autumn Period?   

**A:**  This was before almost 3,000 years ago.   

**Q:**  Was the system in Amdo similar to this serf system?   

**A:**  It was slightly similar in the nomad's area, but it was not that similar in the farming area. For example, it was not similar in the homeland of the Dalai Lama. They had the ownership of one's fields and they were allowed to sell these and others were allowed to buy them. In Tibet, it wasn't like this. In that area, there was no system where the miser belonged to someone. In the nomads' area there were the tribes or deshog [Tib. sde shog], and they were not similar to the farmers.   

**Q:**  What differences were there in the deshog?   

**A:**  They had the system where the miser belonged to such and such a chief [Tib. dpon po] or such and such a deshog. But they didn't need to pay the mibo (human lease fee). This is the second. As for the third, in the beginning, there were a lot of debates when the 17-Point Agreement was signed regarding the position of the Dalai Lama and the Panchen Lama. They were the leaders. Therefore, the debate was whether the Dalai Lama should be placed higher or if the Panchen Lama should be placed higher, or if they should be placed equally.  Finally, Chairman Mao said, "Some of you people are saying that the two of them are equal. It is not like this." It was clearly written in the Revolutionary History of Tibet [Tib. bod kyi gsar brje'i lo rgyus] about the policy work lines in Tibet. The important thing is that it was confirmed that we must mainly develop good relations with the Dalai Lama group. And we must also develop good relations with the Panchen Lama group in a stable manner. This seems like empty talk, but it is very important. If the Dalai Lama and Panchen Lama were equal, then there would be a lot of trouble in Tibet. I think there would have been disturbances long before 1959.   

**Q:**  Some people said that there was the debate where some people said that the Panchen Lama should be placed higher and some said they should be equally placed, right?   

**A:**  Yes, the main thing was that the Panchen Lama was staying in [exile in] China and he was close to the Communist Party. In the policy of the Communist Party, it was said that if there were two objects of the united front [Tib. 'thab phyogs] in Tibet, if we took countermeasures [Tib. kha gtad gcog] against one side and took sides [Tib. phyogs lhung] with the other, this would violate the policy of the united front. They should be treated equally and the Communist Party should place themselves in a lower place. Chairman Mao said, "The Manchu Emperors et cetera had used the policy of 'Divide and Rule'. We shouldn't do this. The Tibet Work Committee [Ch. gong wei] is the united leader of all the areas of Tibet, and Chamdo will also gradually belong to it." Mao in general said that the Emperor and the CCP's policies should be different and he said that "The Dalai Lama should be the main [Tib. gtso bo] and the Panchen Lama should be the secondary [Tib. phal]. They were all objects of a united front. So we should not show favoritism and all of them should be treated equally. We should be fair and should not take sides. We should unite with them and we should not divide and rule them."  The difference in nature between the Emperors and the CCP was that since the local officials listened to the orders from the Emperors, they could do whatever they wanted to do to the subjects. Since the local officials didn't oppose the Emperor, they didn't care what the officials were doing to the miser. The CCP was saying that we should develop good relations with the chiefs and we should mainly work according to the benefit of the majority of the miser. The miser should do revolution and liberate themselves.   

**Q:**  Did they say that in 1953?   

**A:**  This was said before that. The system of the Emperors and the Communist Party was absolutely different. To tell you frankly, according to my opinion, both the Dalai Lama and the Panchen Lama are high lamas, and they are political and also religious lamas. For example, at the time of Emperor Shunzhi, and after that it was the Khangxi Emperor - He was an extraordinary person and he had four lamas. He said, "If the lamas get separated, their strength would scatter." In 1651, he gave a title of a high lama to the Dalai Lama. In 1693, he gave a title to the Jetsun Dampa [Tib. rje btsun dam pa]. In 1706, he gave a title to the Jangya [Tib. lcang rgya] who was the lama in Amdo and Inner Mongolia. In 1713, he gave the title to the Panchen Lama. I think the Emperor was confused when people asked if the 6th Dalai Lama was the real or the fake. So he said, "If we leave the Lamas alone in Tibet, it would be difficult. When there would be some trouble, there wouldn't be any kind of law [Tib. khrims] [for the Lamas]." It was because the Emperors supported them. Otherwise, two of the lamas [the Dalai Lama and the Panchen Lama] wouldn't have political authority, and they were also religious lamas. So the two of them could develop in regards to politics and also with religion. We shouldn't say that religion is not the main thing. Politics and religion were combined together. The reason why the Europeans couldn't deeply analyze the history of China is because they were analyzing it based on the culture of their own country. For example, after the Manchu Emperor was destroyed, all the areas of China were ruled separately. Zhang Zuolin, the father of the Zhang Xiulan, ruled the provinces in the northeast. Yan Xiran ruled the Taiyuan of Shanxi Province. Chen Jichang et cetera ruled Guangxi. Longyun ruled Yunnan. Liu Xiang and Liu Wuhan ruled Sichuan. Ma Pengyi ruled Nyingxia, Siling was ruled by Ma Qicang. Ma Qicang was said to belong to the Guomindang and his power couldn't get into the Guomindang. In the meantime, Xinjiang was ruled by the Qing Shikai. It was impossible to have unity in such a large area with the feudal system. They just remained like independent. Sometimes, it seemed that it was united and also they had some kind of freedom.  In 1979, Khentsab Lobsang Samden [Tib. blo bzang bsam gtan]] and Jebula [Ch. jie fu; Tib. lags] [Gusung] Depön [Tib. sku srung mda' dpon] came to Tibet. We knew each other in the 1950s and attended parties many times, and we were also from the same homeland. So I went to see them to their residence. I just told them in a joking manner, "You guys went abroad for about 20 years, but did you get any result regarding independence?"  They said, "It is difficult. The governments of the foreign countries verbally and secretly were saying that they would support us. But, when the time came for them to actually support us, they were not doing that." At that time, Jebula told me, "When I went to Japan and read some of the books of the Tang Dynasty [Ch. thang shu], it was written that [Tibet] was regarded as independent." I said, "Of course it was. At that time, Zhong Yuan [China] and Tibet were equal. But, later, was there a single government of a country that accepted Tibet as independent?" At first he said, "No." Then he said, "There is." I asked, "Who is that?" He said, "It is Outer Mongolia. This was in 1913."  Then I told him in a joking manner, "If you look at the situation of all of China then, it is very clear. At that time, they rebelled against the Manchu in Yunnan and there were many provinces saying that they were independent, and many of them were also accepted. Actually, Outer Mongolia kind of became independent in 1921, and the world recognized it in 1947 and made the announcement. After 1913, the soldiers of the Beiyang were sent to Outer Mongolia. At that time, Jetsun Dampa [Tib. rje btsun dam pa] said that he was not going to be independent and Beiyang subdued [Tib. 'dus] it. When you analyze it, it is complicated.   

**Q:**  In the early times, most of the Tibetans were shying away from the idea of Communism. But, you liked Communism from the early times. In the beginning, what did you think when you were in the school? Did you think that the policy of the Guomindang was not good and the Communist policy was better? Tell me about your thinking.   

**A:**  At that time, the teachers and the students in the middle school knew about the policy of the Guomindang. It was a school directly set up by the Central Committee [Ch. zhongyang] of the Guomindang. It was not under Ma Qicang. So at this time, the teachers came from outside provinces. We had only one Tibetan teacher. The attitude of the Guomindang was not good. Many people didn't know how Ma Qicang set up the Tibetan Mongolian school [Tib. bod sog slob grwa]. Actually, he gave orders to many different tribes [Tib. sde shog] [for recruiting students] and he requested the Guomindang to set up the school continuously. The principal of the school and my elder brother requested the Guomindang in a secret manner. But the Guomindang was not that attentive. Therefore, when I was studying at the middle school, I thought that I shouldn't rest my hopes with Guomindang. When I went to the university in Beijing, I read the works of Chairman Mao like, "The Coalition Government [Tib. mnyam sbrel srid gzhung]" and the "Commentary on New Democracy." In "The Coalition Government", there was a chapter for the minority nationalities. I was very glad to read that part because I had never heard about that. From the beginning, I knew about the Guomindang and I also read the books of Mao Zedong. When Beijing was liberated, I saw all the good conduct of the CCP. So when I was working in the Primary School in Lhasa, at this time I worked tirelessly from early morning to late at night. I did this because of my loyalty and responsibility to the Tibetan nationality. The correct policy of the CCP made my mind [influenced me] to implement the policy with determination.   

**Q:**  After 1956, did you stay in Lhasa till the revolt took place?   

**A:**  I stayed in Tibet for 35 years. In 1956, I returned to China and attended the meeting for a while and went back to Tibet. Then in 1958, I was again sent to China to study in the Central Committee Party School [Ch. zhong yiang dang xiao] At the time of the Great Leap Forward [Tib. mdun mchong chen po] in China, they said they would not enroll new students and I went back to Tibet. In 1961, when the Panchen Lama, Ngabö and Phagpalha [Tib. 'phags pa lha] went to China, I accompanied them and helped them. I just went on some vacations and to some meetings in China. Otherwise, I stayed in Tibet the entire time. In 1959, on the 13th of March, they said that I was a member of the National Sports Competition [Tib. rgyal yongs lus rtsal tshogs 'du] and I was told to go as the head of the Tibet Sport Group [Tib. bod kyi tshogs pa], but I told them I was not going there in this disturbing situation because I stayed there for my whole life and I wanted to see what really happened in Tibet. They told me that I could go in an armored car, Zhuangjia Che [Tib. zhuang jia che] to the Damshung ['dam gzhung] Airport from Lhasa, and I could travel by air to China. But I still refused and until Oct 24th, 1985, I remained in Tibet.   

**Q:**  Thank you so much. Your memory is like watching a movie.
