### Tape 3  
**Q:**  Last time you said that a volunteer militia force was to be formed and that you all came to Yügye Lhüntse Dzong. All the dzong and the estate [representatives] came. I wanted to ask you some details about this. You stayed there for about 3-4 days right?   

**A:**  Yes, probably we stayed for about 7 days.   

**Q:**  So when you got there, what happened in terms of meetings and when you went there where did you stay. For example you have to eat and the horses have to be given fodder. Was this given by the dzong? So how did things happen when you all got there?   

**A:**  When we got there each of us asked the people who were close to us to prepare housing. I forgot the name, in Yügye Lhüntse Dzong there is the monastery called Nyen Ditru [Tib. gnyan sde drug]. Below the monastery, there are some houses and we were to pay for the firewood, hay and fodder to the tsodrag and they prepared the houses. So the Yügye Lhüntse Dzongpön and the tsodrag discussed this and they got the houses ready for the people coming from the various dzong. They did not accept payment for the hay but we gave money to buy the fodder. Rent [for housing] we don't have to pay, right? So Yügye Lhüntse Dzong played the host. From all the 28 dzong there would be representatives and each one would have their own hearth, right? For example, we from Lhapsö also had a hearth for us and our servants of the dzong and for two more better off tsodrag, and monastic representatives. So we were about 7-8 persons. Everybody else also had theirs, right? Then when we came to E, we borrowed houses from Shaglho [Tib. shag lho] and Lhagyari. They made preparations for me at E Shaglho. So I stayed at E for a while and went to see Kungö Namseling. Kungö advised and we had to meet once again in Tsöna Dzong and all were there - from the 28 dzongs. There was a very large gathering hall called E Gombo Khangsar where we met and Kungö Namseling came and advised and we reported to him about our resolution. So even at these places the miser prepared things for us.   

**Q:**  So the meeting that you had with Kungö Namseling was after you already met at Lhüntse Dzong.   

**A:**  Yes. So we consulted Kungö and said we have done such things and we have made a resolution and we wanted to make this petition and so what do you think - is there anything that we should change? Kungö said that it was excellent. Now I don't know much about history, but the Nubchog Dingpön Kotsa Jola was excellent in history and his composition and math were thorough. If Jola wrote a letter, then even Kungö Namseling couldn't correct it. So Jola stayed there and E Gombo Khangsar Chandzö's wife was Jola's sister. She was earlier the wife of Kungö Namseling. He had a daughter. So Jola stayed with them. They asked me to stay with them, but I did not. Since the tsodrag and others workers were there I stayed at E Shaglho. They made preparations in the assembly hall.   

**Q:**  When you were having a meeting at Lhüntse Dzong how did it take place. Who spoke first. Some must have given their opinions, and did they say that they agreed or did some say that this was not a good, etc?   

**A:**  There was a place where Lhüntse Dzong's Ngawang Chösangla stayed. It was in the Shöl [which means below the dzong]. On one side was the quarters where the lay official Jokpey [stayed as he] did not have his own quarters at the dzong. The quarters at the dzong were held by Ngawang Chösangla. On the east side, there was a place where they both worked and there was a large awning [Tib. ka phibs] where meetings could be held. So we met there and the carpets were laid down by them. As far as the tea and rice, food, etc., these were given by the two dzongpön. Later, they would probably collect this from the miser. So at first we met and talked about what the situation was in the various dzongs; that we have to do this and that and so what do you think? Then we asked them to give their opinions which were written on paper. So we were collecting the written opinions and were referring to them and making the resolution at the same time. So this took about 3-4 days. Then we decided on a resolution and on the number of volunteer forces who were to meet before the 11th Tibetan month, that is before the Ganden Ngamjö [holiday] at Yarlung. The letters were to be sent via Nangkartse and everything was written down as a preliminary resolution. Then we did not call all the representatives, but the more prominent members of the Tsodrag were consulted on the resolution and whatever corrections were needed were made by them and since I had a good handwriting, I made a clean copy [the main resolution]. Kotsa Jola and us - even though Kotsa Jola was there, I was the actual Lhapsö Dzongpön. I and the Nangkartse monk official [dzongpön] were there. The two of us were the main ones and Kungö Jokpey came, but Ngawang Chösangla did not come. And so Jokpey and the beard stayed up there and we stayed below and we gathered around and we discussed. Then the discussions were made into a resolution and then everybody signed. Later, we left the documents with Kotsa Jola . When the Chinese arrested him they took the documents.   

**Q:**  I see, they got the documents?   

**A:**  Yes, they did. I heard that many people were fixed up nicely [paid a price]. I guess they could not burn them.   

**Q:**  Now there was the question of assigning the stewards (nyerpa). Since there were so many Chushigandru, it was said that if from your side some nyerpa were appointed [question not finished]   

**A:**  Yes, we said that, but we did not have the time to do it. We said that we were going to appoint nyerpa, but the Khambas were not agreeing to that. They wouldn't right? Now the Dalai Lama had left already right? The Khambas were not acting well and they were contemplating fleeing. For this reason Kungö Namseling said that appointing nyerpa was not in accord with the wishes of the Khambas, so don't push the matter, just forget about it. Since the Dalai Lama has given use to all the government granaries [Tib. bkar khang] so for the time being the question of buying things from the miser should be put on hold and then we can talk about it later. So the things we were to sell were held on to. Even the meat, we had given a lot of animals. The animals would be slaughtered and eaten, right? So they said that they needed a lot of meat and so the meat that was to be sold should be bought from the miser and pay the local rate. If we were to tell them to sell as before, since now we had lost territory, Lhasa was lost - we have to be diplomatic since the miser might not listen. So we became a bit stern. And since they did not allow us to appoint the nyerpa and the soldiers were distributed and sent with them [with the Khambas]. But things didn't last that much. And so later when the Khambas fled, the ones with horses fled earlier and our militia were being left behind. But, anyway they didn't have many problems.   

**Q:**  Now in the 10th month everyone was to gather at Yarlung right?   

**A:**  Yes, they all came.   

**Q:**  At that time, Chushigandru was there and the Kandrey Magjigang was begun. Kungö Namseling was also there, right?   

**A:**  Yes. And Kungö Samjola was also there.   

**Q:**  Now if I were to ask you in detail about that, what did you do when you got there? You came with 500 soldiers and 36 young sidekicks. So when you got there what did you do in terms of housing and meetings?   

**A:**  We stayed with the Yarlung miser, but they did not make the preparations. If the Yarlung Phodrang [palace] was here, then on the other side of the river, there was a large household whose name I have forgotten. He knew Dakpo Tobla and the Lhapsö Tsodrag Deybor so we had written earlier and said that we are coming so please put us up, so we stayed there. So each of the various groups stayed with some larger households.   

**Q:**  How did this Kandrey Military headquarters work?   

**A:**  The Dalai Lama started the temporary Independent Government at Yügye Lhüntse Dzong [when he was fleeing]. So the two Kungö became the civil and military heads, right? So since the two were the heads according to the order of the Dalai Lama, Kandrey, the Tibetan government and the Chushigandru together formed the Kandrey Military headquarters. Chushigandru had a separate building which was their Military headquarters. So when Chushigandru's tsondzin and the Kungö had to work together it was called the Kandrey Military headquarters. Together they met at the large gathering hall of the Yarlung Phodrang. The hall had a large throne; probably for when the Dalai Lama had came earlier - but it could be later [the throne was the Dalai Lama's throne]. Since we were the Kandrey Military headquarters, we kept the original documents the list of the militia from the various dzongs and gave copies to Chushigandru. I put the seal of Lhapsö Dzong and gave to them [copies of document].   

**Q:**  And you were to have meetings there.   

**A:**  Yes. The office was always functioning. There were problems at the border with people travelling and Chushigandru taking up the arms and ammunitions [of those fleeing]. They were not allowing them to take the weapons with them [when people fled to India]. So there were problems when some people did not want to hand them over. When the two Kungö came, there were many other officials like Kungö Gyentsen Chundenla [Tib. rgyal mtshan chos ldan lags] and Changtrela [Tib. byang bkras lags]. Draktenla and them came later I think. However, many tsidrung arrived and our Kungö Taring [Tib. phreng ring] also came. So from here, the Kandrey Military headquarters escorted them and issued them permits. Otherwise they wouldn't allow them at the border, right? Since there was trouble.   

**Q:**  At that time had all the 10,000 volunteer militia arrived?   

**A:**  All the volunteers were distributed at the border among the Khamba soldiers. The Khambas had regiments and they were given the militia list. They appointed the various positions.   

**Q:**  Now in their various regiments it is said that it was not only Khambas, but also a lot of others, right?   

**A:**  There were people from Central Tibet [Tib. Ütsang]. Later they made an alphabetical name and the Ütsang group was I think called the Shadang Regiment. You know Tsangpa Jola, Bisu [Tib. spel zur], he was in the Shadang. When they made a list [of units by alphabetical names] there were names up to Sha [the consonant "sha"]. Now I don't remember much, but among the Khambas there was the Baligyesum [Tib. 'ba li rhyal gsum] unit that included people from Batang, Litang and Gyaltang. They were the main one and they had all the various regiments arranged. Most of our Ütsang people were kept in the various groups. The volunteer militias were sent to be under various Khamba Commanders. Our rural militia had no commanders, but their overall Commander [Tib. magji] was Kungö Jokpey and myself, but we were at the office in Yarlung. So they were all distributed and sent under the various Khamba gyagpön and jupön.   

**Q:**  Now at Lhüntse Dzong a new government was established and in that, Kungö Kundeling and Andru Jinda [Tib. a 'brug sbyin bdag] [Gombo Tashi] were in it, weren't they?   

**A:**  At first Kungö Kundeling and Andru Jinda did it.   

**Q:**  The Kandrey military headquarters?   

**A:**  No, the Independent Government of Tibet. They were the regents [Tib. srid skyong], but the two of them did not stay and they went as the entourage of the Dalai Lama [to India]. Kungö Kundeling did not stay but it was definite that Andru Jinda was to return. At first Andru Jinda had not arrived from the north. After he arrived, he did not stay and went ahead. Then Namseling stayed for quite some time. Then later he too left. After he left, we stayed until the end. Kungö Namling went to E and Kungö Samjola left from Yarlung and Andru Jinda and Namling went ahead. They left from Lhüntse Dzong. We came with the Khambas, retreating and retreating.   

**Q:**  Now from what you have said, on the one hand there was the volunteer force, right? This had connections with Chushigandru. Chushigandru had connections with Jenkhentsisum. Jenkhentsisum sent letters, right? And they consulted Phala Drönyerchemmo and his group, like Tseja Gyentsenla and Kungö Namseling. It seems that they had a group.   

**A:**  Yes, it seems like they had an organisation.   

**Q:**  Yes. So I see that everyone seemed to be in it together.   

**A:**  Yes, everyone sort of got in like a sub-group, but our thing was done with us the various dzongs discussing this. The kungö did not specifically send letters and tell us to do something. However, we did have some relations; there was Nubchog Dingpön Kotsa Jola. After the Khamba army arrived and created a lot of commotion, we sent a lot of things to be sold to the Khambas and this caused some hardships on the miser. So we said let's form a militia since with this it will be easier to talk. Otherwise, the miser are going to experience a lot of difficulties. At first, the Gyatsa Dzong Tsodrag and Nubchog Jola Kotsa Dingpön Sonam Tobgyela and I had a talk. After our talk, then from Gyatsa Dzong, we spoke with Kurog Namgyal, and then at E we talked with a miser of the monastery called Lamdrin Depala [Tib. ?]. Then there were those under Lhagyari. I did not do the work, but we had our Lhasa Tsodrag Debor doing the work. His wife was the relative/sister of Kungö Champa Yöndenla [Tib. byams pa yon tan]. They arrived at E and they discussed back and forth. Then we sent a letter to the various dzong and that's how we decided to get together at Yügye Lhüntse Dzong. At first, the talk began at Dakpo. From that time on, Kotsa Jola had discussions with Namseling. Jola sent a petition and Namseling said that it would be good to start one. Only later he told me this. Kungö had told him that if you can do something like this then it would be very good.   

**Q:**  When did Kungö say this? When you first started?   

**A:**  We did it in 1958. It was before the Dalai Lama left. The Dalai Lama left in 59, right? We started thinking [about these things] in - the Khamba came to Dakpo in the 3rd and 4th month. And so there were a lot of hardships [for the miser]. They were saying for us to come and arrange the taxes [giving things to the Khambas]. We said don't say that, but look after yourself. The Khambas were staying at Lhagyari and Drigu and all the routes fell on us. We said that since we are located on the road, you have robbed the miser. So we even got into some sort of argument too. The militias were causing some hardship. At that time, Jagö Namgyal Dorji [Tib. bya rgod rnam rgyal rdo rje] [he was the head of the Derge battalion] and their commanders were there and they robbed some of our miser. When we tried to talk to Namgyal Dorje, there was no way to talk to him. When we said that that was no way for his soldiers to act, he just got up and left. Then there was Baba Chandzö Tashi [Tib. bkra shis] and some Litangbas [with those Khambas] and we said what do you think we should do because when we tried to talk to him, he did like that. So they said there is nothing to do. What is there to do? We will try and talk tactfully [Tib. mkhas po]. So there were some prominent people in their group and unless they talked [to Namgyal Dorje], at that time there was no way for us to talk to Jagö Namgyal Dorje. He would just get up without listening.   

**Q:**  Last time, you said that the Dalai Lama was to visit Chönkorgye and that you all thought that if at that time you could suddenly whisk him away then it would be good. Why was the Dalai Lama going to Chönkorgye?   

**A:**  Chönkorgye was the seat of Dalai Lama Sonam Gyatso [Tib. bsod nams rgya mtsho] [the 3rd Dalai Lama], and there was a monastery there and there was also was a Lhamo temple [Tib. mgon khang] of Palden Lhamo [Tib. dpal ldan lha mo]. So as soon as all the Dalai Lama passed their geshe exams [Tib. grwa skor mtsan rtags], they must visit Chönkorgye once. His predecessor also went there and saw Lhamo, and there was something about some Lhamo getting disturbed and that the Dalai Lama got smallpox. So as soon as the various Dalai Lamas completed their geshe exam, they had to go to Chönkorgye. So the [14th] Dalai Lama was to go there, but before he could do so, the disturbances started. So we were thinking of getter the fodder and everything ready and whisking the Dalai Lama away [to India].   

**Q:**  So regarding all this I'm sure Phala Drönyerchemmo and all knew about this.   

**A:**  Yes he knew we had this [plan] in our thoughts and there was also Tseja Gyentsenla [who knew]. We said that the Dalai Lama was coming to Chönkorgye and that we have to try to bring him out at that time, because we just cannot bear to have him in Chinese hands. So we are going to get things ready and when the time comes, you kungö also find the means. In 1957 when I went to deliver the taxes to Lhasa (Tib. ünbü [Tib. dbus 'bul]) Kungö Tseja Gyentsenla and I had a talk. So this was in 1957-58 right. We discussed this and thought about having better persons, ones who were not running dogs of the Chinese and ones who could think, to serve as the dzongpön in the southern areas. So I asked if he could arrange to have cannons from the Potala sent via coracles through the river [to us]. He replied, "Oh, I can't do that, but, anyway I will speak with Kungö Chemmo." So he was not able to send any arms, but we were prepared from the beginning.   

**Q:**  Where was Kungö Tseja Gyentsenla going, to Kalimpong?   

**A:**  No. He was the Drönyerchemmo's main sidekick (aptru) and stayed there [Lhasa]. Finally, at Norbulinga, Gyentsenla and the tsidrung Tema Jokpa Lobsang Nyendra [Tib. bstan ma lcog pa blo bzang snyan grags] shot each other [committed suicide]. You know, Kungö [Laja] Tempala [Tib. bstan pa lags[, the one who has come here [to India]. He saw them. They were soaking some blessed pills in a ladle and were sort of in a hurry and said, "Now don't come around here. It's not good, you know". So they had soaked the blessed pills in a ladle, drank it and they shot each other at the count of three so as to not allow themselves to land in Chinese hands.   

**Q:**  So where did you meet Tseja Gyentsenla?   

**A:**  I came to Lhasa to deliver the 1957 taxes. So at that time I spoke to Kungö about this talk (see above). So Kungö and Chemmo had their own organisation and connections and they discussed it. I said that if you can send arms, then send them quietly because we are thinking of starting a militia organisation. So even at that time, we had thoughts of starting a militia organisation. So he said that if you can start one, then it is good. We discussed this at that time. Kungö was at Norbulinga and he was among the elder Tseja heads and I had stayed at Norbulinga for a year or two as a staff officer [Tib. leja] in that office. He used to treat me very well and I had faith in him. So we served the government faithfully. We didn't do bad things like using the government property [for ourselves].   

**Q:**  So at that time, Kungö was working as Tseja, right?   

**A:**  He was the contact man for Chemmo, if you did not meet Chemmo. In Lhasa, Tema Jokala used to go to Lhasa and sound out things. There was also Depön Tashi Berala [Tib. bkra shis dpal rab] in this organisation. Then also Namseling.   

**Q:**  Did Namseling mention this in his book?   

**A:**  No, he did not say clearly. He said he had contacts with Chemmo. There was very little in it about Chushigandru leaving Lhasa.
