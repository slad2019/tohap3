## Abstract  

 Gendün Tenzin [Tib. དགེ་འདུན་བསྟན་འཛིན] was a monk in the Hor mitsen in Gomang College's Hamdong Khamtsen in Drepung Monastery. He was from a better-off shungyupa natal family who became part of a better-off monk shagtsang (household) that included his teacher and older brother. He was an unusual monk in being a dobdo and achieving the geshe degree. In this interview, he talks about his studies and the life of a pechawa. He also discusses how he worked for his mitsen as its ngünyer and then as the nyerpa. He talks about how he was unusual since he was both a dobdo and a pechawa who received the geshe degree, and how he participated in the dobdo jumping competitions. He also talks about what happened in Drepung after 1959 and how he returned to the monastery in 1985. Finally, he talks a little bit about life in Drepung Monastery at the time of the interview.

The gegen who to taught me <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. མཚན་ཉིད] Buddhist dialectics. This is taught after the six-year curriculum called düdra.">tsenyi</span> was also a different one. But quickly the gegen sent me to another <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. དཔེ་ཆའི་དགེ་རྒན] A monk who teaches reading religious texts.">pecha gegen</span> in the monastery where they had organized to teach us.   

**Q:**  How many <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. དགེ་ཤེས] An advanced degree earned by scholar monks.">geshe</span> are there now in Drepung?

**Q:**  Did you do any work for the <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. ཁང་ཚན] A monastic residential unit in which monks from specific geographic areas lived.

**A:**  Yes, I did a little bit. For example, I did the job of <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. དངུལ་གཉེར] Accountant, bookkeeper, cashier. Someone in charge of cash.">ngünyer</span> of Hor mitsen. I lent out money at interest and used it for giving the <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. གཏོང་སྒོ] A monastic obligation to provide the food and other necessary items served at a monastic prayer assembly meeting or some other rite; this was often a required obligation for monastic officials at the end of their term of office.">tonggo</span> ritual. We got no profit from this. Often it was a loss for us. For example <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. ཐེབས་རྩ] An endowment fund.">thebtsa</span>, was started in the early times when things were cheap. But due to inflation, [in my time] it was not enough to give the tonggo, so the ngünyer had to make it up from our own money.   

**Q:**  How many years did you do the <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. དངུལ་གཉེར] Accountant, bookkeeper, cashier. Someone in charge of cash.">ngünyer</span>?   

**Q:**  It was a 3 year term.   

**Q:**  How old were you when you did this?   

**A:**  About 18 years old. I also did [the] job of the <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. མི་ཚན] A sub-unit of a khamtsen.">mitsen</span>'s nyerpa.   

**Q:**  After you finished the <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. གཉེར་པ] A steward or manager. In some monasteries, the nyerpa was in charge of storerooms under the authority of a higher manager called a chandzö.">nyerpa</span> work, were you in the <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. ཚོགས་འདུ] 1. The general name for the various types of Tibetan government assemblies. 2. Any assembly, e.g., the assembly (meeting) of monks in a college.">tsondu</span>?   

**A:**  Yes. First you do <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. དངུལ་གཉེར] Accountant, bookkeeper, cashier. Someone in charge of cash.">ngünyer</span>, then you are in the tsondu.   

**Q:**  What work did the <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. གཉེར་པ] A steward or manager. In some monasteries, the nyerpa was in charge of storerooms under the authority of a higher manager called a chandzö.">nyerpa</span> do?   

**A:**  The main work was to give the <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. གཏོང་སྒོ] A monastic obligation to provide the food and other necessary items served at a monastic prayer assembly meeting or some other rite; this was often a required obligation for monastic officials at the end of their term of office.">tonggo</span> to the monks and there wasn't much work to do. The main work was supposed to be to oversee the discipline, but actually we didn't need to do that. Hor <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. མི་ཚན] A sub-unit of a khamtsen.">mitsen</span> had a large group of monks, but we didn't have many <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. ཚོགས] 1. A prayer assembly meeting in monasteries when all the monks come to an assembly hall and chant prayers together. 2. An offering made of tsamba, butter and dry cheese in the shape of a cone.">tsog</span> to hold. There were about 26-27 all day tsogs in a year. The <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. གཉེར་པ] A steward or manager. In some monasteries, the nyerpa was in charge of storerooms under the authority of a higher manager called a chandzö.">nyerpa</span> job in general was hard because the nyerpa had to give the monks the all day tonggo for 4 days every month. So only the monks from the big <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. ཤག་ཚང] 1. The household or family of a monk that consisted of multiple monks. 2. The apartment of a monk household.">shagtsang</span> and well-off families could have their monks do the nyerpa job because it cost a lot and the household had to help them. It was difficult even though there were 2 nyerpa at a time. Actually, it seemed that we couldn't do it, but by the grace of the protector deities [Tib. ཆོས་སྐྱོང་སྲུང་མ] we managed it. The main thing was that my elder brother was very capable and he helped me   

**Q:**  Other than giving the <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. གཏོང་སྒོ] A monastic obligation to provide the food and other necessary items served at a monastic prayer assembly meeting or some other rite; this was often a required obligation for monastic officials at the end of their term of office.">tonggo</span>, what else did the <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. གཉེར་པ] A steward or manager.

The nyerpa had to read the mitsen's charter (Tib. ཇཡིག [བཅའ་ཡིག]) when he took over the position.

Then they had to find food on their own, but they would get the <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. འགྱེ] Alms given to monks.">gye</span> and phog.   

**Q:**  Was there any income for these <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. གཏོང་སྒོ] A monastic obligation to provide the food and other necessary items served at a monastic prayer assembly meeting or some other rite; this was often a required obligation for monastic officials at the end of their term of office.">tonggo</span>?   

**A:**  No. There were some endowments which were not even enough to handle the fuel.   

**Q:**  So how did you manage it, did you take loans?   

**A:**  We took a little bit of loans, but one's friends and relatives would give donations for the <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. གཉེར་པ] A steward or manager.

**Q:**  In <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. སྒོ་མང] One of the large colleges in Drepung Monastery.">Gomang</span>, do you have a kind of rule when you can have your own <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. དགེ་ཕྲུག] 1.

In the Jang günchö, there was the pechawa from the three great monastic seats, and in addition to that, the monks from Radö [Tib. ར་སྟོད] monastery would also come, and some came from some monasteries in Lhoka.

**A:**  No.   

**Q:**  Your name is M.0007, right?   

**A:**  Yes.   

**Q:**  When you were young, did you have to go to the <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. ཚོགས] 1.

**A:**  We were supposed to go if we could, but there were so many monks. So it was up to each monk and they didn't have to go. For the ones who went there, they had very strict discipline. The ones who were active had to go to the <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. མང་ཇ] The morning tea served to monks from all the monastic colleges at the main prayer assembly hall.">mangja</span> every morning where there were 4 teas which were supplied by the Dewashung. Then the <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. ཆོས་ར] The special grove (&quot;dharma grove&quot;) in monasteries where monks formally met to practice debating.">chöra</span> would be held and we would have to go to the chöra. After that, we would go to the <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. གྲྭ་ཇ] The prayer session sponsored by the tratsang (college) at which tea was served to its monks who attended.">traja</span> and the mid-day session called <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. ཉིན་ཆོས] A mid-day study session in monasteries.">nyinchö</span>, and then there was a break for about 2-3 hours.

**A:**  Two are relatives and one is not.   

**Q:**  Have they been admitted into the monastic community [Tib. སྒྲིག]?   

**A:**  Only the older one was admitted in the monastic community. Nowadays, it's hard to get admitted. It used to be easy in the past.   

**Q:**  How do they get admitted? Do they give tests?   

**A:**  They give tests, but this isn't very hard and most can do this. For example, from a long <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. དཔེ་ཆ] Religious books/texts, scriptures.">pecha</span> with many pages, there might be about 70 pages to memorize.   

**Q:**  Do they have to go through back door relations [Tib. ལྟག་སྒོ]?   

**A:**  It probably is via back door relations. It is said that the higher ups do not permit more monks to be admitted in the monastic community, but I don't think so because I heard that Labrang Tashikhyil [Tib. བླ་བྲང་བཀྲ་ཤིས་འཁྱིལ] has about 1,000 monks now.   

**Q:**  If you are admitted in the monastic community, what do you get? Do you get a salary [now]?   

**A:**  You get the alms, but they don't transfer your the resident card [Tib. ཐེམ་ཐོ] [to the monastery].

Salary (for a job). 2. The salary-like payments in grain, etc., that monk&#x27;s receive from their monastery.">phog</span>, right?

**Q:**  If you work, you get the grain and if not, you don't get the grain, right?   

**A:**  Yes.   

**Q:**  Do your <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. དགེ་ཕྲུག] 1. Student. 2. Disciple. 3. Commonly the name for monks living with a gegen or teacher. These are more like wards than real disciples.">gidru</span> work?

**Q:**  Does he have time to study <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. དཔེ་ཆ] Religious books/texts, scriptures.">pecha</span> if he works in the apple orchard?   

**A:** . From after the 10th lunar month to the 2-3rd lunar month, there is no work, so he can study pecha. They also can study in the morning and evening and on Sundays.   

**Q:**  If you say you want to study <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. དཔེ་ཆ] Religious books/texts, scriptures.">pecha</span> and don't want to work, can you do that?   

**A:**  In the past, you could have studied <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. མཚན་ཉིད] Buddhist dialectics. This is taught after the six-year curriculum called düdra.">tsenyi</span> whenever you wanted, but now you have to work for a few years and pass the tests well, and then they will allow you to study tsenyi.   

**Q:**  How many <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. མཚན་ཉིད] Buddhist dialectics. This is taught after the six-year curriculum called düdra.">tsenyi</span> pechawa are there?   

**A:**  Probably, there are about 100 of them.   

**Q:**  What would they do [to subsist] because they are not admitted in the monastic community?   

**A:**  Their <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. རྩམ་པ] The traditional Tibetan staple food that consists of grain that is roasted (popped), usually in sand, and then ground into a flour.">tsampa</span> was brought from their homes. I and one <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. དགེ་ཕྲུག] 1. Student. 2. Disciple. 3. Commonly the name for monks living with a gegen or teacher. These are more like wards than real disciples.">gidru</span> would get the alms and salary. So we buy tea and butter from that.   

**Q:**  Are the alms okay these days?   

**A:**  They are not bad.   

**Q:**  In general how much do you get per month?   

**A:**  When there are more visitors, the <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. འགྱེ] Alms given to monks.">gye</span> becomes more. In winter it is more and we get 30-40-50 <span class="tooltip" data-text="[ch. 元] China&#x27;s basic currency unit. A yuan is divided into 100 fen and 10 jiao. It is also known as renminbi or &quot;people&#x27;s currency.&quot;">yuan</span> in a month. Summer is worse and in some months, there is no gye at all because there are no visitors. It depends on how many visitors come.   

**Q:**  How old were you when you passed the <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. དགེ་ཤེས] An advanced degree earned by scholar monks.">geshe</span>?   

**A:**  I was 34.

**Q:**  How did you pass the <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. དགེ་ཤེས] An advanced degree earned by scholar monks.">geshe</span>? Would they give you an exam for the geshe?   

**A:**  When you studied <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. དཔེ་ཆ] Religious books/texts, scriptures.">pecha</span> for some time, your seniority turn [Tib. མིང་ཚམས] to be a <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. དགེ་ཤེས] An advanced degree earned by scholar monks.">geshe</span> would come.

These were the best, highest type of geshe. In general, you ask the abbot to give you the title of geshe [Tib. མིང་བཏགས་གནང]. When he thought you were ready, in the <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. ཆོས་ར] The special grove (&quot;dharma grove&quot;) in monasteries where monks formally met to practice debating.">chöra</span>, the abbot would give you a <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. ཁ་བཏགས] A Tibetan ceremonial scarf given to lamas, visitors, etc.">khata</span> and say "From now on, you are a geshe and I give you the geshe name." Then if you can give a <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. གཏོང་སྒོ] A monastic obligation to provide the food and other necessary items served at a monastic prayer assembly meeting or some other rite; this was often a required obligation for monastic officials at the end of their term of office.">tonggo</span>, you give that.

A type of monastic debate where two or three monks sit while others stand and ask them questions.">thamja</span> shag [Tib. བཞག].

**Q:**  When was this?   

**A:**  I think it was after my <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. དགེ་ཤེས] An advanced degree earned by scholar monks.">geshe</span> exam was finished.

**Q:**  Yes. <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. སྒོ་མང] One of the large colleges in Drepung Monastery.">Gomang</span> won and after that they stopped it. I heard that you were there when they stopped the chogyag. They called you people. Who called you there?   

**A:**  The laji told the <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. གྲྭ་ཚང] A &quot;college&quot; within a monastery, for example, in Drepung Monastery there were four main tratsang: Gomang, Loseling, Deyang and Ngagpa. These tratsang were property owning corporate entities and included monks who were organized into residential dormitories called Khamtsen.">tratsang</span> and the tratsang called us.

In monastic settings it also refers to an adult monk who acted as a guardian to a younger monk. In such cases, the younger monk typically lived in the gegen&#x27;s apartment (shag).

Anyway, I was planning to go there inconspicuously but then I heard that the <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. གྲྭ་ཚང] A &quot;college&quot; within a monastery, for example, in Drepung Monastery there were four main tratsang: Gomang, Loseling, Deyang and Ngagpa. These tratsang were property owning corporate entities and included monks who were organized into residential dormitories called Khamtsen.">tratsang</span> had told them to stop the chogyag, so I didn't go.   

**Q:**  Basically, you were in the <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. ལྟོ་ཚང] 1. The club of the Dobdos. 2. A group of people eating together.">tobtsang</span>, but you didn't go there, right?   

**A:**  Yes. Actually, if I went for the <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. ཕྱོགས་རྒྱག] A kind of monks&#x27; competitive &quot;sports&quot; event (mostly jumping and throwing) done by dobdo monks.">chogyag</span>, I should have gone there 4-5 days earlier to rest my body because I had to jump.

In monasteries, however, it could also mean a real teacher, or the monk who served as the guarantor for a new monk.">gegen</span> wouldn't let me go. so I was waiting until the very end and I was going to go there on the eve of the chogyag.   

**Q:**  At that time, they beat the monks with switches and made them prostrate 50 times, right?   

**A:**  There was no beatings, but they had to do prostrations in the chöra.   

**Q:**  When was this? How many years before you passed the <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. དགེ་ཤེས] An advanced degree earned by scholar monks.">geshe</span> exam?   

**A:**  I'm not sure. I was about 35-36 years old.   

**Q:**  Was this in the 1950s after the Chinese arrival?   

**A:**  After the Chinese arrived, the <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. ཕྱོགས་རྒྱག] A kind of monks&#x27; competitive &quot;sports&quot; event (mostly jumping and throwing) done by dobdo monks.">chogyag</span> was not allowed, although there were still dobdo.   

**Q:**  When they stopped you from doing the <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. ཕྱོགས་རྒྱག] A kind of monks&#x27; competitive &quot;sports&quot; event (mostly jumping and throwing) done by dobdo monks.">chogyag</span>, how old were you?

**A:**  It was before that. No. I think they were before us. I am talking about the lunar calendar. After we did the <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. ཕྱོགས་རྒྱག] A kind of monks&#x27; competitive &quot;sports&quot; event (mostly jumping and throwing) done by dobdo monks.">chogyag</span>, there was no more chogyag, and they didn't even prepare for that.   

**Q:**  I heard that Rinchen Könchog [Tib. རིན་ཆེན་དཀོན་ཅོག] set up a new <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. ལྟོ་ཚང] 1. The club of the Dobdos. 2. A group of people eating together.">tobtsang</span> after that where he was the senior head [Tib. གེངོ]. They planned to do the <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. ཕྱོགས་རྒྱག] A kind of monks&#x27; competitive &quot;sports&quot; event (mostly jumping and throwing) done by dobdo monks.">chogyag</span> with Ngagpa College. Then Ngagpa College told them to postpone it for a few years and they did the Lhagyel [Tib. ལྷ་རྒྱལ] Chogyag and yelled "May the god be victorious" [Tib. ལྷ་རྒྱལ་འཐེན].   

**A:**  I didn't know about that. But yes, in the beginning, Rinchen Könchog did the <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. ཕྱོགས་རྒྱག] A kind of monks&#x27; competitive &quot;sports&quot; event (mostly jumping and throwing) done by dobdo monks.">chogyag</span> with Ngagpa College.   

**Q:**  Was that after the Sera War?   

**A:**  Yes. I am not sure it was true or not, but it was said that the Sera War was caused [Tib. བསླངས] by the <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. ལྡབ་ལྡོབ] A mildly deviant type of fighting or &quot;punk&quot; monk who engaged in fighting and other unusual behaviors for monks in traditional Tibet&#x27;s large monasteries.">dobdo</span> tobtsang massing together.   

**Q:**  Who do you think originated this prohibition? Was it the laji or the <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. ཡིག་ཚང] The highest office dealing with monastic and religious affairs in the traditional Tibetan government. It is often called the Ecclesiastic Office. It was headed by 4 fourth rank monk officials called Trunyichemmo. The senior Trunyichemmo was called Ta Lama.">Yigtsang</span>?   

**A:**  Probably the <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. ཡིག་ཚང] The highest office dealing with monastic and religious affairs in the traditional Tibetan government. It is often called the Ecclesiastic Office. It was headed by 4 fourth rank monk officials called Trunyichemmo. The senior Trunyichemmo was called Ta Lama.">Yigtsang</span> told the laji and they called the tratsang.   

**Q:**  You couldn't do the <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. ཕྱོགས་རྒྱག] A kind of monks&#x27; competitive &quot;sports&quot; event (mostly jumping and throwing) done by dobdo monks.">chogyag</span>, right?   

**A:**  Yes. Even though we had already made the site for the jumping competition.   

**Q:**  Were you in the monastery in 1959?   

**A:**  Yes.   

**Q:**  When you were at the Mönlam in 1959, did you think the revolt would take place?   

**A:**  Yes, we were saying that the revolt might take place since it was said that there was the organization called <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. ཆུ་བཞི་སྒང་དྲུག] The anti-Chinese Khamba insurgency force in Tibet that began in 1957 in Lhasa and launched an uprising against the Chinese the following year. The name means, &quot;four rivers and six mountain ranges,&quot; and refers to Eastern Tibet.">Chushigandru</span>, though I wasn't involved.   

**Q:**  You went to the Mönlam and then returned, right?   

**A:**  Yes. I returned to Drepung. Usually on the 17th-18th of the 2nd lunar month, the <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. ཚོགས་མཆོད] The large religious prayer festival held in Lhasa in the 2nd Tibetan lunar month.">Tsongjö</span> would start. And the revolt took place on the 10th of the 2nd lunar month. At that time, I was in the monastery.   

**Q:**  How did you first come to know the cannons started firing?   

**A:**  People said it would be bad and they [Chinese] would kill us and make us suffer, so I went over to the upper part of the valley, and crossed the mountain pass behind Drepung and fled to my home in Tölung. I returned in the 5th lunar month. My older brother and 3 other <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. དགེ་ཕྲུག] 1. Student. 2. Disciple. 3. Commonly the name for monks living with a gegen or teacher. These are more like wards than real disciples.">gidru</span> also fled together. We were 9-10 monks.   

**Q:**  You crossed the mountain pass after the revolt took place, right?   

**A:**  Yes. In the 5th lunar month I returned and they all stayed there. There was my brother and 4-5 gidru. Then I stayed in the monastery until 1967.   

**Q:**  When you returned, was the Democratic Management Committee [Tib. དམངས་གཙོ་བདག་གཉེར་ཨུ་ཡོན་ལྷན་ཁང] set up?   

**A:**  Yes. I asked them for the permission to return to my <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. 1. ཤག, 2. ཞག] 1. The apartment/room of a monk. 2. The butter fat that coagulates on the top of butter-tea when the tea is left to sit for some time. If the tea had been made with a lot of butter, this layer could be thick enough to scoop off and save to later sell or eat separately. The senior monks are usually served tea with a lot of shag.">shag</span> and they said okay.   

**Q:**  Did you wear monks' robes then?   

**A:**  Yes.   

**Q:**  What did you do then? Did you stay in the <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. 1. ཤག, 2. ཞག] 1. The apartment/room of a monk. 2. The butter fat that coagulates on the top of butter-tea when the tea is left to sit for some time. If the tea had been made with a lot of butter, this layer could be thick enough to scoop off and save to later sell or eat separately. The senior monks are usually served tea with a lot of shag.">shag</span>?   

**A:**  I went for the study session [Tib. སློན་སྦྱོང] until the 9th month. Then after this I went to Ngachen Phang [Tib. རྔ་ཆེན་འཕྲང] to work on the Power Station. They sent about 400 Drepung monks there.   

**Q:**  At this time, how many monks were there in Drepung?   

**A:**  About 4-5000. Before that, there were about 10,000 I think. Later many monks were jailed and only the common monks [Tib. གྲྭ་རྐྱང] [non monastic officials] were left.   

**Q:**  Weren't you classified as <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. གྲལ་རིམ; ch. 阶级] 1. A social class. 2. A class enemy.">trerim</span>?   

**A:**  No. In the old society, the <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. དགེ་ཤེས] An advanced degree earned by scholar monks.">geshe</span> were regarded as common monks and weren't regarded as <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. གྲལ་རིམ; ch. 阶级] 1. A social class. 2. A class enemy.">trerim</span>. But in the revolution era, they regarded the geshe as trerim a little bit and they were called <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. ཆོས་ཚབ] A communist classification that literally means &quot;the representative of religion.&quot; It referred to monks such as geshes who served the religious needs of the lord&#x27;s class.">chötsab</span>, which meant that we served the <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. མངའ་བདག; ch. 领主] Feudal lord, manorial estate holders, serf-owners.">ngadag</span> who practiced religion. For example, in the past when they did the cleaning of the courtyard, the geshe didn't have any exemptions from this like the <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. ཆོས་མཛད] The title of monks who made a payment or gave gifts to secure exemption from the normal &quot;young monk&quot; work obligations. There were tratsang chöndze and khamtsen chöndze.">chöndze</span> and the <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. གྲྭ་ཚང] A &quot;college&quot; within a monastery, for example, in Drepung Monastery there were four main tratsang: Gomang, Loseling, Deyang and Ngagpa. These tratsang were property owning corporate entities and included monks who were organized into residential dormitories called Khamtsen.">tratsang</span> chandzö did. We had to go do the cleaning like a common monk. And we also had to go to get the <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. འགྱེ] Alms given to monks.">gye</span> and <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. ཕོགས] 1. Salary (for a job). 2. The salary-like payments in grain, etc., that monk&#x27;s receive from their monastery.">phog</span> in person, but the ex-officials could send their <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. དགེ་ཕྲུག] 1. Student. 2. Disciple. 3. Commonly the name for monks living with a gegen or teacher. These are more like wards than real disciples.">gidru</span> to get the gye and phog for them.   

**Q:**  After you came back to the monastery in the 5th lunar month, what did they teach you in the study session? Do they hold the study session from morning until evening? Did they hold the <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. ཚོགས] 1. A prayer assembly meeting in monasteries when all the monks come to an assembly hall and chant prayers together. 2. An offering made of tsamba, butter and dry cheese in the shape of a cone.">tsog</span> then?   

**A:**  There was no <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. ཚོགས] 1. A prayer assembly meeting in monasteries when all the monks come to an assembly hall and chant prayers together. 2. An offering made of tsamba, butter and dry cheese in the shape of a cone.">tsog</span> then. The study session was held all day. We were taught all the things that we hadn't heard.   

**Q:**  Did they hold the study session in the <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. ཆོས་ར] The special grove (&quot;dharma grove&quot;) in monasteries where monks formally met to practice debating.">chöra</span> or in the assembly hall?   

**A:**  They held it in the <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. ཆོས་ར] The special grove (&quot;dharma grove&quot;) in monasteries where monks formally met to practice debating.">chöra</span> and also in Hamdong's dukhang.   

**Q:**  What did you do when there were no study sessions?   

**A:**  There was no time when there was no study session.   

**Q:**  Did they tell you that capitalism is not good, etc.?   

**A:**  Yes, they taught us about the "three big mountains" [Tib. རི་བོ་ཆེན་པོ་གསུམ] and "oppose three and exempt two" [Tib. ངོ་རྒོལ་གསུམ་དང་ཆག་ཡང་གཉིས], and "three cleanings" [Tib. གཙང་མ་གསུམ], etc. There were a lot.   

**Q:**  What did you have to say? Did you say, "Yes, yes".   

**A:**  We had to go through the motions of saying yes.   

**Q:**  How did you get your food? There was no <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. འགྱེ] Alms given to monks.">gye</span> and <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. ཕོགས] 1. Salary (for a job). 2. The salary-like payments in grain, etc., that monk&#x27;s receive from their monastery.">phog</span>, right?   

**A:**  Yes. How could there be <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. འགྱེ] Alms given to monks.">gye</span> and <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. ཕོགས] 1. Salary (for a job). 2. The salary-like payments in grain, etc., that monk&#x27;s receive from their monastery.">phog</span>? We didn't get even a single fen.   

**Q:**  How did you get your food?   

**A:**  I ate from the little bit that was left in my shag. Then after awhile, it became loosened up a little bit and my family was able to send me a little bit of food.   

**Q:**  Were some monks eating in the joint eating commune at this time, or were the monks eating individually?   

**A:**  There were different financial conditions among the monks. So for the poor monks who didn't have food to eat, their food was supplied from the common tea and butter in the <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. ཁང་ཚན] A monastic residential unit in which monks from specific geographic areas lived. These were corporate entities with property and internal officials. Some large khamtsen had smaller subordinate units called mi tshan. Khamtsen were part of tratsang (colleges). For example, Hamdong Khamtsen was part of Gomang College in Drepung Monastery.">khamtsen</span> and the <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. མི་ཚན] A sub-unit of a khamtsen.">mitsen</span> in the monastery, and they ate together in a eating commune. The monks who had things to eat, ate their own food in their shag.   

**Q:**  Did they ask for volunteer workers for the Power Station construction?   

**A:**  Externally, they said it was for volunteers, but in reality no one came forward to be volunteers, so they nominated the monks to go.   

**Q:**  What did you do after that?   

**A:**  After this work was done, I returned to the monastery and I planted trees in the monastery. They had drawn the lines and one person carried a hoe and the other carried a shovel, and we dug the holes for the trees.   

**Q:**  Were these apple trees?   

**A:**  No, these were the simple trees. At that time the apple trees were yet to be planted. After some time passed, we planted the apple trees. Then it was time for the Tibetan New Year. So they told us, "If you are going to Mönlam you can go. If not, you can stay in the monastery."   

**Q:**  Did they hold the Mönlam in 1960?   

**A:**  They held the Mönlam in 1960 and 1961, and then there was no Mönlam.   

**Q:**  What was the Mönlam like? There were less monks, right?   

**A:**  Yes, there was only a small number of monks in the courtyard of the Jokhang.   

**Q:**  Did they hold the Mönlam in the same way?   

**A:**  Basically, it was same.   

**Q:**  Did the monks sit for the <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. མཚན་ཉིད] Buddhist dialectics. This is taught after the six-year curriculum called düdra.">tsenyi</span> debate [Tib. དམ་བཅའ་བཞག]?   

**A:**  Yes.   

**Q:**  Was there also <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. མཚན་ཉིད] Buddhist dialectics. This is taught after the six-year curriculum called düdra.">tsenyi</span> debating in the monastery at this time?   

**A:**  No. It was only at the Mönlam. There was no <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. ཆོས་ར] The special grove (&quot;dharma grove&quot;) in monasteries where monks formally met to practice debating.">chöra</span> after the revolt. The monks were all send to work. I worked at the Ngachen Phang on 4 different occasions. Then I also worked on a motor road construction project, and then I dug ditches for the thick electric wire that was put underground.   

**Q:**  Was there any <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. ཚོགས་མཆོད] The Great Prayer Festival in Lhasa in the second Tibetan month">tsongjö</span> held?   

**A:**  Not at all since 1959.   

**Q:**  Was there <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. ཚོགས] 1. A prayer assembly meeting in monasteries when all the monks come to an assembly hall and chant prayers together. 2. An offering made of tsamba, butter and dry cheese in the shape of a cone.">tsog</span> sometimes in 1960-61?   

**A:**  No <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. ཚོགས] 1. A prayer assembly meeting in monasteries when all the monks come to an assembly hall and chant prayers together. 2. An offering made of tsamba, butter and dry cheese in the shape of a cone.">tsog</span> like we had in the early times. At meal time, all the monks would gather there and they would serve 2 teas, and they would tell us about the study and the work to be done.   

**Q:**  Were you allowed to go to perform rituals [Tib. ཞབས་བརྟན]?   

**A:**  No.   

**Q:**  So you could practice religion in [your] <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. 1. ཤག, 2. ཞག] 1. The apartment/room of a monk. 2. The butter fat that coagulates on the top of butter-tea when the tea is left to sit for some time. If the tea had been made with a lot of butter, this layer could be thick enough to scoop off and save to later sell or eat separately. The senior monks are usually served tea with a lot of shag.">shag</span>, but not outside, right?   

**A:**  Yes. Trindor: [not on the tape] In 1963 a person hired our horse cart to go to Ganden to give <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. འགྱེ] Alms given to monks.">gye</span> at the tsog.   

**Q:**  When the monastery's food ran out, what did you do?   

**A:**  After some time, we bought grain from the government with the wages we got from the work and the monks were given monthly tsampa.   

**Q:**  At that time, were the leaders of the monastery monks or laymen?   

**A:**  In the beginning, they were all monks and there were also 40-50 laymen cadres who mainly did the work. And all the former lords [Tib. དཔོན་པོ] were shut up in prison.   

**Q:**  How did they start the Cultural Revolution?   

**A:**  When the Cultural Revolution started they said we were not allowed to keep any statues.   

**Q:**  At first, they held a meeting, right?   

**A:**  Yes.   

**Q:**  Were you allowed to wear monks' robes?   

**A:**  In the beginning, it was okay, but then they said that we were not allowed to wear the monks' robes. So they set up an organization where the monks' robes were dyed black. Some of the monks who were more tough or brave [Tib. ཞེད་པ] saved their monks robes. But the weaker ones dyed the monks robes black and made pants and garments from these. And then I returned home.   

**Q:**  Did they ask if you want to go home or stay in the monastery?   

**A:**  Yes. They said "If you want to go to the countryside, you are free to go." So I said I'd go and they said all right.   

**Q:**  Were there many struggle sessions?   

**A:**  Yes. There were a lot of struggle sessions.   

**Q:**  Were most of them <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. ལས་སྣེ] The general name for all monastic officials.">lene</span>?   

**A:**  Yes.   

**Q:**  In 1985 you returned. How did you do this? Did you submit a report?   

**A:**  They appointed some leaders and I knew some of the leaders. I asked them for permission to return and he said, "It is okay. Come to the study session for tomorrow."   

**Q:**  From 1985 until now, was the discipline in the monastery kind of the same?   

**A:**  Yes, about the same.   

**Q:**  Could you keep <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. དགེ་ཕྲུག] 1. Student. 2. Disciple. 3. Commonly the name for monks living with a gegen or teacher. These are more like wards than real disciples.">gidru</span> in 1985?   

**A:**  I stayed in the monastery awhile going for circumambulations without being admitted into the monastic community. Then I asked to be admitted and I was admitted in 1987.   

**Q:**  Who has the power to admit the monks?   

**A:**  The committee [Tib. ཨུ་ཡོན་ལྷན་ཁང] had the power.   

**Q:**  Did they have to report this [to] their superiors? Or did they make the decision?   

**A:**  In the beginning, they probably made the decision. But now they have to ask the higher ups for permission and they give permission for say, 20-30-40 monks to get admitted into the monastic community.   

**Q:**  How is your livelihood now? Do you get a salary from the Old People's Home [Tib. རྒས་གསོ་ཁང]?   

**A:**  I'm not in the Old People's Home since they didn't transfer my residence permit, and they didn't send me there.   

**Q:**  Does your family help you?   

**A:**  Yes. My family helps me.   

**Q:**  In the old society, what would happen if a monk has no <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. དགེ་ཕྲུག] 1. Student. 2. Disciple. 3. Commonly the name for monks living with a gegen or teacher. These are more like wards than real disciples.">gidru</span>, and if he is sick and can't work?   

**A:**  The <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. མི་ཚན] A sub-unit of a khamtsen.">mitsen</span> would help and they would send a servant to nurse him, and they would also give <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. རྩམ་པ] The traditional Tibetan staple food that consists of grain that is roasted (popped), usually in sand, and then ground into a flour.">tsampa</span> and those things. This is written in the mitsen's document. Patients were treated very specially and it was written that they should send a person to nurse him and give him food. The document was kept with the seal from the <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. སྡེ་བ་གཞུང] The name of the traditional Tibetan government.">dewashung</span> which they had asked for. Similarly, the monks had their own <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. ཁང་ཚན] A monastic residential unit in which monks from specific geographic areas lived. These were corporate entities with property and internal officials. Some large khamtsen had smaller subordinate units called mi tshan. Khamtsen were part of tratsang (colleges). For example, Hamdong Khamtsen was part of Gomang College in Drepung Monastery.">khamtsen</span> where they belonged to.   

**Q:**  If a person was sick for a long time would they still help him?   

**A:**  Yes. And the patient also got his share of <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. འགྱེ] Alms given to monks.">gye</span> and phog.   

**Q:**  Was there ever a case when a monks family sent one of their layman children to look after the sick monk?   

**A:**  No. I never saw this happen, though it may have occasionally been done like this.   

**Q:**  Were there cases when the monks help their parents who need help or money in their old age?   

**A:**  Yes. This was done.   

**Q:**  Do most of the monks keep close contact with their family or don't they?   

**A:**  If their household lives nearby, there is close contact. In my case, I didn't return home very much. Most of the monks go home after Mönlam and work and stay until the 10th month. And then they bring <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. རྩམ་པ] The traditional Tibetan staple food that consists of grain that is roasted (popped), usually in sand, and then ground into a flour.">tsampa</span> and cow dung and come to the monastery in 9th-10th month, and stay for the winter. But there are many good and righteous lamas and monks [Tib. སྐྱེ་བུ་དམ་པ] who stay in the monastery and study <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. དཔེ་ཆ] Religious books/texts, scriptures.">pecha</span> even if they don't have enough food to eat. But some monks go home after the Mönlam and some drink <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. 1. ཆང, 2. བྱང] 1. Tibetan locally brewed barley beer. 2. North; nomad areas north of Lhasa in Nagchuga Prefecture 3. ch. 厂 factory.">chang</span>, etc. After Mönlam, there is not much <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. འགྱེ] Alms given to monks.">gye</span> and <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. ཕོགས] 1. Salary (for a job). 2. The salary-like payments in grain, etc., that monk&#x27;s receive from their monastery.">phog</span> in summer so they stay at home and help out there. In the winter, there are more visitors, so there are more <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. ཚོགས] 1. A prayer assembly meeting in monasteries when all the monks come to an assembly hall and chant prayers together. 2. An offering made of tsamba, butter and dry cheese in the shape of a cone.">tsog</span> and more income, so they return and live in monastery.   

**Q:**  If you want to keep a new <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. དགེ་ཕྲུག] 1. Student. 2. Disciple. 3. Commonly the name for monks living with a gegen or teacher. These are more like wards than real disciples.">gidru</span>, do you have to ask the committee for permission?   

**A:**  Yes you do. This year there is a new rule and they made it very strict saying we are not allowed to keep new gidru. This was made in this year.   

**Q:**  How many monks are there now?   

**A:**  Some ran away, some were expelled. So there are a little over 300 in the monastery.   

**Q:**  These were the ones who were admitted into the monastic community, right? How many are there who are not admitted in the monastic community?   

**A:**  There are about 400 who aren't admitted and who are studying by asking for lodging. This year they have started a new school for the new <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. དགེ་ཕྲུག] 1. Student. 2. Disciple. 3. Commonly the name for monks living with a gegen or teacher. These are more like wards than real disciples.">gidru</span>. It has 152 monks. In the past, the gidru who had some sources of income didn't have to work and they could study. But this year there is another new rule which said that the monks are not allowed to stay without working and all those who are 17-18-19 and in their 20s and the 30s have to work. There are about 90 such monks. They also made a list of those who are asking for lodging and studying.   

**Q:**  So you monks got angry with this, right?   

**A:**  The monks aren't angry I think, but the ones who rent the houses might be angry because they raised the rents. There are also many retired monks who in the past have been monks and have returned to the monastery. In the past, the monastery had sent about 400-500 monks to Kongpo to build roads and to learn to drive vehicles, and some were also sent to schools. A number of these have now retired. Some were still monks and some were not monks, but they stayed single and returned to the monastery. So they are angry about the raising of the rent up to 20-30 <span class="tooltip" data-text="[ch. 元] China&#x27;s basic currency unit. A yuan is divided into 100 fen and 10 jiao. It is also known as renminbi or &quot;people&#x27;s currency.&quot;">yuan</span> for a room with one pillar in a month. So they were saying that this was not good at all.   

**Q:**  Do these retired monks wear monks' robes?   

**A:**  Some wear monks' robes and some don't. They get retirement from their offices so they are not allowed to join the monastery. They do some free work, like fixing the road for circumambulation and the road to monastery, and they even donated about 500-1,000 <span class="tooltip" data-text="[ch. 元] China&#x27;s basic currency unit. A yuan is divided into 100 fen and 10 jiao. It is also known as renminbi or &quot;people&#x27;s currency.&quot;">yuan</span> for the monastery and also told the monastery to keep their belongings after they die. So many of us are thinking that it's better to have these retired people because if there is no one living in a house, the house will get dilapidated. So there is a lot of criticism about charging high rent. In the past, there was no one taking care of the houses and the houses got dilapidated. Then when these people stayed in the house, they would renovate the houses. When I stayed in this house, the rafters had departed from the beams because some Chinese had stayed and made the house dilapidated by pouring water when using cement, but I plastered the walls again.   

**Q:**  What did you think when they stopped the <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. ཕྱོགས་རྒྱག] A kind of monks&#x27; competitive &quot;sports&quot; event (mostly jumping and throwing) done by dobdo monks.">chogyag</span>? Were you angry?   

**A:**  I didn't have much idea about that and I was not very angry.   

**Q:**  But you were planning to go there, right?   

**A:**  Yes. I was planning to go. I was good at the games so the <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. ལྟོ་ཚང] 1. The club of the Dobdos. 2. A group of people eating together.">tobtsang</span> regarded me very highly.   

**Q:**  Were you the chief or margenpa [Tib. མ་རྒན་པ]?
