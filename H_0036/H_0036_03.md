## Abstract  

 Changkhyim [Tib. chang khyim (bras khang)] was a monk official in the Tibetan government who was the brother of Tsipön Shakabpa (of JKTS) in Kalimpong. In this short phone interview, he discusses the mission that Phala sent him on March 17th to secretly ask the Indian Consulate General about asking the Indian government, and especially, Prime Minister Nehru, for help should the Dalai Lama have to flee to India after leaving Lhasa for Lhoka.

### Tape 3  
**A:**  On the morning of March 17th, I went to the Assembly meeting at the Shöl Parkhang, which had been going on for a few days. There a messenger arrived saying that I should go immediately to Phala's house in Norbulinga after 12 p.m. So I went there and Phala said, "I have a very important job for you. You were posted at Phari before and you know the Indian political officers well. I need you to go to Dekyilinga and see the Consulate General." When I asked him why, he said that I should tell the Consulate General that "The situation is such that the Tibetans have demonstrated to protest against the Chinese invitation to the Dalai Lama to see a show. The Tibetans claim that they have always been independent, and so there is a lot of commotion. At the same time, the Chinese have increased their military strength, and even these nights, reinforcements are continuously arriving. In Nortölinga, there is a Chinese military camp, so it is a potentially dangerous situation which you yourself are well aware of. So if something should happen, then for us Tibetans, the Dalai Lama's life is of the highest importance. If all of a sudden there is war, then it is most dangerous. In the southern area of Tibet, we have our guerrillas there and we are thinking of taking the Dalai Lama there. If it should happen that he cannot remain there, then he will have to go to India. So please inform the Indian government [of this], and especially Prime Minister Nehru himself." [In his second telephone conversation, Changkhyim says: "That we have guerrillas in the south and the Dalai Lama plans to stay there. If the Chinese give chase, then he has only India to turn to." I asked him if permission and asylum were specifically sought? He said no- it was only stated that the Dalai Lama could only look toward India (Tib. zhal gzigs sa rgya gar ma gtogs yod pa ma red).] So I went there to Dekyilinga and said, "This is what Drönyerchemmo Phala asked me to tell you." I went there along with the Sikkimese Yaba Gyakpala's elder brother (can't remember his name) and we met Consulate General Major Chikpar and asked him to send this message immediately, that same night. All of this was top secret, as the situation was very dangerous.
