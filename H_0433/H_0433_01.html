<h2 id="abstract">Abstract</h2>
<p> The interviewee was a miser who belonged to the Lhalu aristocratic family and then became an estate manager for Lhalu. In this interview, he discusses his education at a school run by the Epa Clerks of the Tibetan government in Lhasa, and how afterwards, he became the shid&#xF6; (estate manager) for Lhalu&apos;s Garchag estate in Kongpo. He describes the estate&apos;s management during this time, including procedures set forth in the Land Enumeration Settlement of the Iron-Tiger Year [1740]. He also discusses issues such as tax collection, lending grain, and decisions made regarding property divisions. He talks about how he was in charge of collecting taxes on goods that businessmen took from China when the PLA was about to enter Tibet, and how Indian officials came to the estate he was heading in NEFA (the Northeast Frontier Agecy. today&apos;s Arunachal Pradesh) in 1951 to take over tax collection from him because they said this area was part of India [they said this was due to the Simla Convention]. He also talks about how he was sent to Derge G&#xF6;nchen in 1951 to collect taxes and later returned to Gamtog Drukha.</p>

<p><strong>A:</strong>  Shall I tell you from the beginning when I managed the estates of Lhalu and the name of my family?   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  Yes, please.   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  My family belonged to the Lhalu [aristocratic] family and we were working for that household. We held the position of shid&#xF6; (estate manager) for this Lhalu&apos;s shiga (estates). Lhalu had eight bigger households under it and the eight households were acting as the estate managers of Lhalu&apos;s estates. My father was sent to Kongpo to be the estate manager of the Garchag Estate [Tib. sgar chag] in Kongpo. It was located in the area of Tselagang [Tib. rtse lha sgang] Dzong. Because my father was managing this estate, I went there when I was 15 years old from school and I began to manage the Garchag Shiga from when I was 18 years old. This estate had 190 chid&#xF6;n on which they had to pay taxes to the government, but it only had 75 nangd&#xF6;n of land from which inner taxes were paid [just to Lhalu, their lord]. It was a big estate and had several small estates in the area that were under it. Do you want to know the specific names of all of them?   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  Yes, if you could.   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  The major estate was Garchag shiga and its shid&#xF6; was me. Under it, Tsom&#xF6;nling [Tib. tshe smon gling] had one estate there that was called Gyara shiga [Tib. rgya ra gzhis ka]. Another was called Barang shiga [Tib. ba rang]. It had about six miser households. We collected the butter tax from the Tsom&#xF6;nling estate and we handed [it] in to Tsom&#xF6;nling. Barang shiga belonged to Lhalu. There was an estate called Bangt&#xF6; [Tib. &apos;bang stod] in the lower area of Kongpo and there was a Serdog [Tib. gser mdog] shiga in the upper area. And there was Bangkor shiga that was located in the Kyemdong [Tib. skyem gdong] area. I collected all the taxes for those shigas and I sent kind of servants to collect the taxes from those estates. I worked in this area for 19 years since the time when I was 15 years old.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  What was your rank at that time?   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  I did not have any rank. If [the estate] was under the government, some of the shid&#xF6; were aristocrats. But because this shiga belonged to the Lhalu family, it sent the shid&#xF6; from among their servants. I was one of them.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  Were you the shid&#xF6; of the estate?   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  Yes, I was. The Garchag shiga was given to the Yabshi family of the Dalai Lama. Normally, the estates that were granted to the Yabshi were called Khyongdeb [tib &apos;khyongs thebs], which means support for the Dalai Lama&apos;s family. These were under the Tselagang dzong which had 16 estates that belonged to the government, to monasteries and to aristocratic families. Among the shiga under this county, four of the major estates provided tsodrag. We, the Garchag shiga, were one of these major estates. One of these, the Horong shiga, belonged to Shatra. One was Demo&apos;s [Tib. de mo]. Demo&apos;s estate was managed by a tsidrung of the government. When dzong meetings were held, the four tsodrag would attend the meetings. Their position was just under the dzongp&#xF6;n.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  You said you went to the school when you were 15 years old. Which school did you go to?   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  I had studied in a school in Lhasa from when I was 7 years old until I was 15 years [old].   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  Which school?   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  At first I went to the Tatongwa [Tib. rta gtong ba] School in Lhasa for several years. [Tatongwa was an official who was in charge of arranging horse corv&#xE9;e in Lhasa.] Then I studied under the Epa Clerk [Tib. e pa drung yig] of the Kashag. His home was located behind Muru Monastery. Then I went to Kongpo when I was 15 years old.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  What did you do when you managed the estate? I mean what things did you actually do during a year?   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  Mainly, I collected the grain and butter from those small estates. If the government sent a notice to collect money or something else as their taxes, I collected them from the local people and handed [it] in to the place where I should hand it in. I collected the grain and butter from those shiga under Garchag Shiga and handed it in to the Laja Treasury Office that was on the second floor of the Tsuglagang. I had to hand in one thousand khe [weight] of butter for one year. One thousand khe of butter was needed to be handed in to Lhalu. I also handed in to Lhalu two mules, some loads of peanuts and peaches, and ropes for tents.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  Didn&apos;t you hand in grain?   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  No, we did not. The major tax was butter.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  Did you have to send some firewood?   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  No, we did not have to. We also did not have to hand in money. One thousand khe of butter was the major tax.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  I heard some talk about the different levels or positions for the local people like the Nangsen. I mean how many categories were the people be divided into in your place?   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  I had a higher position in that area at that time. I was acting like a dzongp&#xF6;n in my shiga. Of course, the Governor General of this area was in Tselagang. But because it was a part of the shiga for the household of the Dalai Lama, people called it Garchag Dzong and the house was much better than the dzong government. Actually we were just the shid&#xF6;. I was the shid&#xF6; for the shiga and under this shiga there were several smaller shiga. There were four households like the tsodrag called Gadag [Tib. bka&apos; bdag], which meant holders of a land tenure document, and they were exempt from paying taxes.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  Do you know when they got these? During the 5th Dalai Lama or the 13th?   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  I do not know the certain time, but it was in very early times. I guess they probably got the land tenure document [Tib. bka&apos; gtan] during the period of Desi Sanggye Gyatso [Tib. sde srid sangs rgyas rgya mtsho] [During the era of the 5th Dalai Lama]. Those documents had became dirty and black.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  Didn&apos;t they have other documents?   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  No. They were called the Gadag and they got partial exemption from the taxes, but they had to pay some butter taxes to the Lhalu Household. They were in a higher position than the miser. Those households&apos; names were Kaltong (Tib. skal gdung), Matong [Tib. ma gdong], Lamdo Chugtar (Tib. bla mdo phyug thar) and Shoka Sharchog [Tib. sho kha shar phyogs]. They were Gadag households and every [one] of them had one lag of mules (a set of 10 mules). When I needed to transport the two thousand khe of butter to Lhasa, those four households would do it. I weighted it and gave it to them and they went twice to transport it. After they moved it twice, some butter still remained to move, and the major shiga would move it to Lhasa. It means that I myself had to move the remaining part of butter.  However, the shiga had only five mules when I took the position. Usually, the taxes would be collected twice from the local people. The best butter would be produced in the 6th month, so we collected the first time in the 7th month and the second would be collected in the 10th month. We loaded all of that butter and then moved it to Lhasa.  Mules were very popular domestic animals in the Kongpo area. So every year many mares would produce baby mules for a lot of families. We chose some baby mules from them and it was called, &quot;tagba&quot; [Tib. btags pa], which means to tie it up. One day, all the mules of the village, including the baby mules and their mother mares, would be brought together and I could pick out several from the herd according to the total number. I did not have to pay the real price, but only a part of it. Usually we paid six dotse and that was equal to 300 ng&#xFC;sang. It was a pretty low price. I could pick out about ten baby mules every year. For the same reason, we could also pick some baby dzomo.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  After you picked those animals, who would manage them?   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  We would keep them. There were four government herders [Tib. ru pa] under my control. Those four herders were located in Nepar of Maru, Barang, Galtong and Nangdrog [Tib. nang &apos;brog], which was located very close to our shiga. Every fourth month we made an accounting [record] for each herder for their female animals that would have calves. At that time, the policy of traditional lease called gyeme chime (Tib. skyes med shi med) was used. So if the four herders increased the number of their animals, all of those additional animals belonged to me, but if the total number of animals decreased, I would pay it back. For the first several years, I had a very hard time because low quality animals were given to me when I began to manage those herders. However, because I had managed the four herders for a long time, I got a good income. When I left this position, I myself had two hundred yaks, including male and female yaks, and I was able to set up a private herd for myself.  At the place where the shiga was located, there were only 18 households and this village was called Garchag Sh&#xF6;lpa [Tib. sgar chag zhol pa]. This village had one Gadag household who was called Chukor Sharchog. The head of that household was called Sonam Dorje [Tib. bsod nams rdo rje] and he was the gembo (headman). There was another Gadag Household that was located behind this village. The name for this household was called Yeshe Tamdrin [Tib. ye shes rta mgrin]. And this village also had one gembo.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  How many households would be there?   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  It only had about six households.  One (Gadag) household was in the upper area and this area was called Kyemdong.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  Was it the place where they made paper?   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  Yes, it was. There was one household that belonged to us and at the upper village there was a shiga that belonged to us. It was called Bangkor shiga.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  Did you pay a tax in paper?   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  No, it belonged to the county. One of our shiga and some of the masses were located [resided] in their place. The lower area would be divided into three regions (Tib. ney [Tib. gnas]): Outer Ney, Middle Ney and Inner Ney [Tib. gnas phyi nang bar gsum]). Outer Ney included Garchag and the surrounding area. Then if you continued to go to the lower area, you will pass a bridge called Nelung Bridge and arrive in a village called Mola. It was the first village of Middle Ney. It had about one hundred (treba) and this village had one gembo. If you go behind this village, you will arrive in Barang shiga. It had two treba. From this village if you go the upper area, you will arrive in Kasar village which had ten treba with one gembo. Then you will arrive in Bamtseg [Tib. bam rtseg] Village. The whole name of this village is Bamrim Tsegpa [Tib. bam rim rtseg pa]. This village had one Gadag Household whose name was Kadong because behind their home there was a rock that had the letter &quot;ka&quot; on one side (Tib. Kadong [ka gdong]). The upper area had Gyara shiga that belonged to Tsom&#xF6;nling. It had six treba. If you go to the lower area of Kongpo, there was a village called Shoga [Tib. shog kha] and it had about 20 (Tib. treba) households.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  How many households were there under your shiga?   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  According to the tax system, there were 75 d&#xF6;n.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  How many households were there on one d&#xF6;n of land?   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  One d&#xF6;n was equal to three gang. This shiga had 190 chid&#xF6;n of land to pay taxes to the government but it only 75 nangd&#xF6;n of land that had to pay inner taxes. So, some households might have three gang of land, but some had two gang of land or even one gang of land.  Shoga had eight d&#xF6;n, in Bamdrong there was a shiga called Bamteng Shiga that had two d&#xF6;n of land with only five or six households. Baka had 13 d&#xF6;n of land and it had one gembo. Lamdo [Tib. lam mdo] had eight d&#xF6;n of land with about 30-40 households.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  How did you divide the land into d&#xF6;n and gang? Was it according to the land or people?   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  At the beginning, I guess it was divided according to the people, but recently some households have increased the number of their people while some have decreased, and some of them have became extinct [Tib. stongs]. In such extinct cases, the collective [the group] planted their land and the collective [group] paid its taxes. This was called Tonggang [Tib. stongs rgang]. Moro had 13 d&#xF6;n of land. Barang had 2 d&#xF6;n of land. Kasar had 13 d&#xF6;n of land. Bamtseg had 12 d&#xF6;n of land and Geba [Tib. gas pa] had 4 d&#xF6;n of land. However, I don&apos;t remember the number of households in these. I know there were big villages that had over one hundred households. I guess the total number of households might be about 500-600 households. I do not know the number for certain.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  Can you please tell me what you did in an entire year from spring to the winter?   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  Normally, I lived in the shiga, and the major shiga had 200 khe of land. That number is certain. There were 8 treba in Garchag and their village was called Garchag Sh&#xF6;lpa [Tib. gar chag zhol pa]. Every household would send one corv&#xE9;e laborer and we planted the two hundred khe of land. After the harvest, we managed the grain [supply]. I sent one of my servants to Bamteng Shiga. This shiga had a good income and it would select one corv&#xE9;e laborer from each household in the four villages in the Kongpo lower areas and plant the land. It could produce 800 khe of grain per year. It was a good shiga. I sent one servant to Serdog Shiga. This shiga could get 300 khe of grain in yield. Bamdrong Shiga was leased to another and could get 40 khe of grain as the lease fee.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  One khe of land could produce how many khe of grain?   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  The yield was very poor. Usually one khe of land only produced about 4 or 5 khe of grain. In the Garchag area, the yield was especially poor and the crops would easily get damaged by the insects. The insects were eating the roots of plants.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  If so, was the grain produced from the land enough for the local people?   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  Yes, it was. The Middle Ney area was agropastoral, but mainly they were nomads. They only had a little piece of land, so they needed to buy grain. Usually they bought grain from my shiga and they paid me with butter. One khe of butter exchanged for two khe of grain. They came to get grain in summer and would bring butter in the 9th and 10th months.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  You said there were tsodrag and gembo. How were they appointed?   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  These were permanently held by a certain households, except in Shoga where there were two gembo who were the heads of the two bigger households in this village. Those two families took the position by turns. The other tsodrag were unchangeable because they had the land tenure document. This position was held by the households and the head of the households took the position. For example, if we had a meeting, we sent a message to the tsodrag and gembo and they transmitted it to the masses. If a meeting was held, the gembo and tsodrag would attend this meeting.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  How many tsodrag were there?   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  There were only four families. For the meeting, each village would send one representative. At the meeting I would transmit the orders from the government. Normally, I would stay in the shiga permanently and settle the matters regarding the taxes, lands and law cases regarding the land, and married couples.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  For example, if an argument arose about a piece of land, how did you deal with it? Can you tell me some instance when you had settled it?   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  Yes, I can. There was a land tenure document book called Jetra Shebam [Tib. &apos;byed khra she bam]. This was written by measuring all lands by steps [Tib. gom pa] and it listed them in the book. The stones piled on top of the others indicated the borderline between the households. All fields were given names and listed in the book. This book that was formulated by the Tibet government could indicate which field belonged to which household and how big it was. It was a rolling style book. This book could not only indicated who was the owner of a specific field, but also indicated the land of the government, the aristocrats, or the monasteries, including mountains. We could find an owner for every specific place.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  Was that the book called The Land Enumeration of the Iron-Tiger Year [Tib. lcags stag zhib gzhung]?   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  Yes, exactly right.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  Then it did not change, right?   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  Not at all. If there were any arguments that related to land, we solved it according to The Land Enumeration of the Iron-Tiger Year. However, the land tenure document called the Shebam was given to Lhalu&apos;s household and that book could indicate Lhalu&apos;s right to punish or exercise legal jurisdiction over its subjects [Tib. khrims &apos;go rang btsan]. Normally, most shiga were not allowed to judge cases, except minor disputes. Mainly they had to report them to the dzong (district). But we, the Garchag shiga, could judge cases because Lhalu had the right to punish or exercise legal jurisdiction over its subjects. But there was a problem. Because we ourselves judged cases in our shiga and it became that we kind of were ignoring the dzong, we did not always have a good relationship with the dzong.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  Oh! Really? Do you have any experience about settling disputes?   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  The biggest case would be murder. In this case, we should report it to the dzong. Normally, we ourselves would make the judgments for the other cases. So sometimes, when the dzongp&#xF6;n would be powerful or bossy, he would say something to us. However, we had the right to punish or exercise legal jurisdiction over one&apos;s own subjects, so we did not have to obey the dzong very much. Basically, the dzongp&#xF6;n hated us.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  How many days did you need if you took a trip from your shiga to the dzong?   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  It was a two-days trip.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  Where was the dzong located?   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  Tsela dzong was located in the lower area of Nyingtri [Tib. nying khri]. It was very close to Nyingtri.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  Wasn&apos;t that in Kongpo Giamda [Tib. rgya mda&apos;]?   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  No.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  You said you went from village to village to collect the animals in the fourth month, right?   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  Yes. I needed to know how many newborn animals were there because that was related to collecting butter. If I didn&apos;t make a list of the newborns, they would not pay the butter taxes. The other taxes were collected according to the listing in the book.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  Did you send your servants to do it?   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  No. I myself did it. I was young. I guess I was 17, 18 or about 20 years. So I did it by myself.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  Did you know the traditional method of counting, the diu?   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  What do you mean?   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  The method where they did the calculation using beans and sticks etc.   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  Yes, we used to, but now I have forgotten it. But at that time we did the calculation using that method. We also had the fractions [Tib. cha phran]. We also went to the nomads in the tenth month to collect the animal numbers that had died in the year. Then we added the newborn animals and reduced the number of deaths. Finally we could get the actual animal number. We made an account for it every year.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  When would they deliver the butter tax to you?   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  I had to go to the village to collect them. I went twice a year. One was in the sixth month and the other one was in the tenth Tibetan month. It was the best time to produce butter. We collected butter and weighed it, and then made loads and stored it in our shiga. We stayed five or six days in every village and collected the butter tax. After loading the butter, we sent it to the shiga and stored it.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  Then how did you send it to Lhasa?   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  Each of the four tsodrag would transport the butter to Lhasa twice, and still some remained so I had to move that. Each of the four households had one lag of mules. I collected the butter and stored it in the shiga and then moved it. We could send butter to Lhalu at any time and the number of loads did not have to be big. You know, one herd of mules usually could only move 40-50 loads of butter at one time, and if it was for Lhalu, we could send it directly. Normally, however, the butter tax should be handed to the Laja Treasury Office. It had to be handed in in one shipment. So we would move the butter into Lhasa many times and store it in Lhasa. They would not receive a small amount of butter. On the other hand, even if they received one thousand loads of butter, they wouldn&apos;t make a note of this on paper. They would just make the note on a samtra traditional message board. And then the second part had to be handed in very soon. Otherwise, the note would get rubbed off on the message board and if the note was lost, they wouldn&apos;t take into account the butter we had already delivered. Moreover, each time we delivered the butter, we had to give one load of butter for each person who was weighing the butter there. So if you sent butter many times, you would lose more butter. Usually every time we weighed the butter, we would lose two loads of butter because there were two people who would sit on two loads of butter, and these would not be counted. So we stored butter in Lhasa and when we had more than one hundred loads of butter, we would deliver it to the Laja Treasury Office .   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  How many khe [khe] were there for one load of butter?   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  Usually we would make twelve khe for each load of butter for ourselves, but ten khe loads for the butter that would be sent to the Laja Treasury Office, because if we made each load of butter smaller, it would be more khe to carry.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  Why? It is not possible. Did they use another standard of scale?   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  No, if we made a small load of butter, they would weigh it carefully. If we made bigger loads of butter, they used to decrease the actual weight. So if we made bigger loads of butter, we would lose a lot, so we would make small loads of butter for the Laja Treasury Office. The ten khe scale was the biggest one for it. So we made each load of butter ten khe and if we met a good person, he would do the account for us saying these were 11 khe or 12 khe for each in the Laja Treasury Office.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  What kind of scale did you use?   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  It was a Tibetan scale called Tentshig gyama and was made from wood. It was the standard scale and it had a seal from the Tibetan government on it. At that time, there were standard volume measures and also weight measures of khe.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  I see. I heard that while measuring the butter, the people weighing the butter would sit on a load of butter and this load belonged to the person. Was it true?   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  Yes, this load would be confiscated. As we do today, they were not weighing the butter properly, so we had to visit his home and give one or two loads of butter to him. Then he would weigh it well for us, and if the load was ten khe, he would make the note for 11 or 12 khe.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  In what month would you usually hand in the butter?   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  It was very hard to hand in it every single year. I was in Kongpo about ten years but I only handed it in three times.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  But it was an annual tax.   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  Yes, it was. But all taxes were summed together and were handed in several times. If the total number was not big enough, they did not make the note on paper, they just wrote it on a Samtra. If we couldn&apos;t deliver it continuously, the note made on the Samtra would get rubbed off after a time and we would have to bear the misfortune [loss].   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  What else did you do?   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  Usually, I stayed in the shiga and some local people would visit me every day. For example, some people would visit me for borrowing grain or cash, and businessmen came to exchange butter and grain. At that time they took grain from me and later they would send the butter to me.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  How did you lend (grain)?   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  When they borrow grain from the government, ten khe of grain required paying one khe of interest (per year), [Tib. skam skyed bcu zur]. However, if we lent grain from our private grain, the interest was much higher than that of the government. If we lent five khe of grain, we could get one khe of grain as the interest (per year) [Tib. lnga drug &apos;gro]. If we lent the loan at high interest, we collected one khe of grain as interest for four khe of grain (per year). This was called &quot;four becomes five&quot; [Tib. bzhi lnga &apos;gro].   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  How many khe of grain did you usually lend per year?   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  It would be a huge number. The Garchag shiga usually could harvest about 600 khe of grain and the Bamteng shiga could harvest about 800 khe of grain. We stored the seed [for planting] and left some grain for religious offerings, but the other grain should be sold.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  So it was sort of business, right? And you were trying to sell as much as you could, right?   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  They would come to ask for grain. It was a business, otherwise I would not have income. Usually, we lost about 300 khe of butter every year when we were collecting the butter and handing it in. In addition, we did not have wages. So we had to earn money by ourselves.   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  When I began to take the position of shid&#xF6; in Garchag shiga, it had only five mules and five or six horses. Ten years later, when someone else took over my position, I had about 200 yaks and 120-130 horses and mules. I owed the Laja Treasury Office more than 2,000 but less than 3,000 khe of butter, but there was more than that number of butter that needed to be collected from the miser that I had lent them. Of course some of them were very poor and were unable to pay back the grain. Usually, during the 6 years term, most of the shid&#xF6; would owe a lot to the Laja Treasury Office and to Lhalu and others, but during my term, I could actually just get the accounts balanced.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  When did you take the position? Was it when you were 15 years old?   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  Not really. I went to Kongpo when I was 15 years old and lived there with my parents for three years. Then my parents returned to Lhasa and I did the shid&#xF6; work alone. I was the shid&#xF6; until I was 25 years old.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  But you were very young.   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  Yes, I was.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  You might have had some very capable servants?   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  Servants of our household were from the countryside, so they were not so capable. So I had to take the main responsibility. I took a servant who could take notes, one servant for doing the diu calculation and one for weighing.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  How did you handle it when there were some sort of lawsuits?   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  It depended on what kind of lawsuit it was. For example, if a couple had an argument and their land needed to be divided between them, I would receive petitions from both sides. I would also ask about it to the local people. After I understood the actual situation, then I made the decision for them.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  For example, if a couple wanted to divorce, how did you make the decision for them?   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  This was one kind of argument. But basically the main arguments would arise over the land. For example, two households had their own lands. In the middle of the land that belonged to the two households, there would be a small empty piece of land. Usually, it was used as a grassland for pasturing animals. Then one side cultivated some part of the grassland and made their own fields bigger. In such a case, according to the Land Enumeration of Iron Tiger Year, I needed to measure the fields. If someone wanted to set up a new household because the person and some other members of this household had some argument in their home, I helped them to divide all of their property including the furniture, animals, and fields according to the number of people.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  How did you make decisions for such cases? What was your main legal principle?   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  Generally. I decided it according to the &quot;13 Article Legal Code&quot; [Tib. khrims yig zhal lce bcu gsum]. In addition to that, when I divided the things, it was done according to the custom of G&#xF6;ph&#xF6; Jusur, that is, confiscating one tenth of the things that was divided.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  How did you do that?   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  All of their property was divided into ten parts and one tenth of their property was confiscated and the other nine parts of their property would be divided according to the number of people. For example, this household had ten animals. We confiscated one animal and then divided the nine among them.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  All of their property?   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  Yes. It included the animals, grain and land.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  What would be the most serious criminal issue? I mean what kind of criminality was so serious that you could not make decision by yourself?   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  If someone committed murder it would be considered as a serious crime. In such a case, I needed to report it to the dzong and then it would be reported to the Tibetan government. Basically I made the decision and reported it to the dzong. Because we had special rights, we could make decisions, but we needed to report about it to the county.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  Did you have a prison?   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  Yes we did. We also had leg shackles and wooden shackles, and whips to implement the punishments.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  Who was in charge of it?   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  I was.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  Didn&apos;t you have a judge?   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  No, we did not. But during the time I was there, I did not meet such a thing.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  What else did you do?   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  There was a place called Nenang [Tib. gnas nang] where we needed to cross a bridge called Sangga [Tib. gsang sga?]. We were unable to walk on the bridge because it had only one piece of round wood that that was about 18 domba in length. The place was also called Bajag Shri [Tib.?].   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  Why were you unable to go on it?   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  There was a river flowing underneath and both sides were rocky mountains so they placed the wood there without building any wall to support the bridge. Therefore, we were unable to cross the river on a single piece of wood. So when we collected the taxes from them, the local people collected it and carried it on a human&apos;s back to move it to this side. The local people could carry a 12 khe load and walked on it with canes. There were four villages under Bajag Shri: Lhalung [Tib. lha lung], Gawari [Tib. dga&apos; ba ri], Manchuka [Tib. sman chu kha] and so on. We needed to appoint a headman for them. They were [ethnically] M&#xF6;npa people (Tib. mon pa). They were handing in taxes to us.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  What kind of taxes did they hand in?   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  They were handing in 75 khe of rice, 3,000-4000 khe of a red dye that was made from a wood and many skins such as marmot, a kind of deer called Khasha [Tib. kha shwa], the skins of mountain goats, bear, leopards, gung [Tib. gung] [a kind of leopard], and so on. All of those taxes had been divided between each household. Each household also handed in honey that was stored in bamboo tubes. On the other hand, they could receive some sort of payment. After they handed in their taxes, we gave them salt at cost price. This [lower price] was called P&#xFC;rin [Tib. spus rin].   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  How much salt did you give?   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  We paid one khe of salt for 12 khe of red dye.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  How much did you pay for honey?   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  We just paid a few sang for other items. It was a token, not a real price. For example, each piece of skin, including the skin of a bear, would be given three sang. They also had lot of red pepper and they would hand in more than 70 khe of red pepper. One khe of red pepper would be given ten dre of tsamba. It was just kind of half price.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  Who was the authority over them?   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  I was.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  And did they have local headmen?   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  I appointed a headman [Tib. dpon po] called Depa. He was working under me.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  How did you appoint him?   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  Usually, they had a traditional headman who had inherited it from his father. When I was there, the headman was called Depa Ch&#xF6;sang [Tib. sde pa chos bzang]. He was very powerful in that area and he was causing many hardships for the local people. So he and the local people did not have a good relationship. Many local people complained to me when they handed in their taxes. So I replaced him.  Before that time, he was very powerful and when he was making speeches at the meetings, he was saying strange things. As you know, when we were offering a mandala, we would pray, &quot;Mount Meru, the king of the mountains surrounded by outer walls [Tib. phyi yi lcag ri khor yug gis bskor bai&apos;/ ri yi rgyal po ri rabs]. So he used that sentence and said that he was Mount Meru, the king of the mountains that was surrounded by outer walls [Tib. phyi yi lcag ri khor yug gis bskor bai&apos;, ri yi rgyal po ri rabs mi nga.]. The local people did not know what he was saying, but they were afraid of him. In addition, he used a whole roll of raw silk fabric as the khata scarf. At that time, when people visited a headman, they had to offer a khata to the headman. It was the custom. For example, if they held a meeting of gembo, each of them would offer one khata to me. I received it and did not give it back to them. He used to use the whole roll of raw silk fabric as a khata and when he held a meeting, the local people had to offer silk clothes to him. He also caused some arguments in their area.  When my father was the shid&#xF6; of this shiga, Depa Ch&#xF6;sang was the headman of those areas. However, after I began to be the shid&#xF6;, the local people were complaining lots about him. At that time there was another man who wanted to challenge for this position too. He asked me many times to give him the position of headman. His name was Pemba [Tib. spen pa]. I asked the masses and the masses said this person was an honest man. However, the old headman was a person that nobody could cope with. But he came to meet me frequently and he always offered a khata and 3-6 whole rolls of raw silk fabrics and tiger skins to me, and he explained what he was doing. In about 1949 or 1951, once he visited me and I seized him there because his behavior was so bad and he was talking back to me too much when I scolded him quite seriously. So I tied him up and shut him inside the prison. The prison was in the basement of the building. This room had very big pillars and we tied him to such a big pillar and shackled his legs. Some of the Lopa people had very bad behavior. On that day, I went to the other side of the river. That place was called Magong, and in the afternoon when it was getting dark, I returned to my shiga. When I entered into the gate and I saw five or six M&#xF6;npa people. They used to have poisonous arrows. They were doing something, but I did not pay attention to them. They did not shoot arrows at me. We had a prison but we did not have guards for it, but I thought he was not able to flee from that prison. Actually during the time when I went out, they borrowed tools from a blacksmith in the village, broke the door, cut off the shackles and took him away. He successfully fled from my prison.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  Where did he flee?   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  He was brought to his hometown. However I had appointed the person called Pemba as the headman for the M&#xF6;npa and the masses liked the new leader. As a result, we had good times for several years. Later when I went to collect taxes from the Lopa, he [the old gembo] sent a group of Lopa soldiers to kill me.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  Did you have weapons in your shiga?   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  Yes, I did. I had one handgun and two Japanese rifles, and a Mauser rifle. Even though he sent fighters, he was not able to hurt me.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  Do you know if that person is alive or not?   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  I guess he died. I got a message from Pemba saying that he had sent soldiers to kill me. At that time I was taking a trip in the forest. I did not know where he was waiting for me, but we did not meet in the path of the forest. Since then his power became weaker.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  Did you hear about him?   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  He lost his position and the masses did not support him anymore. Then the masses got happier lives. The new leader was an honest person and he and the masses had a good relationship. So it was the biggest event that happened when I was in there. But it did not have a final solution because he fled.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  What else did you do?   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  Later Bajag Shri was lost to India and it came to belong to India [Note: As a result of the Simla Convention of 1914]. I have been asked about this history by some people who came from China. I told them specifically about it. In short, an Indian man called Dele Sahib visited me and told me that Bajag Shri belonged to them.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  When was this?   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  It was in 1951. He said during the time of Minister Shatra, this shiga had been given to India, so since then, I no longer collected the taxes because they would collect it.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  What is the name of that place?   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  Bajag Shri. I responded to what he said saying, &quot;It is impossible because this is our place and I have to collect the tax and hand it in to the Tibet government and the Lhalu household. It is my duty. If I do not do so, I will receive punishment. You can ask others if you do not trust me.&quot; I heard that four airplanes came to that place and they landed there. Later I learned it was helicopters. They stayed there the whole day and flew back in the afternoon every day. They took lunch with them and had it there. They calculated the population and established schools. When they calculated the population, because no one reported the number, they gave cotton clothes to the local people and they calculated the number of clothes in order to get the number of the population. People, like spies, often came to meet me and told me some information. I asked how did they get the number of people, and they told me that they [the masses] did not tell them the number, but the Indians distributed clothes and got number of people that way.  </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  Did you meet the Indian person?   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  The person called Dele-sup [sir] arrived in my shiga, but those people who came by airplanes did not come to meet me.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  Did the Indian speak Tibetan or Hindi?   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  He had an interpreter whose name was Tsering [Tib. tshe ring]. He said he had been born in Gyantse. I reported all about this to Lhalu. Since then, the local people did not hand in taxes to me.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  How long did the Indian stay at your place?   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  He stayed three days. I do not know why, but he and his helper climbed at the night and got some plants from the mountains. He took a lot of pictures and collected many flowers. There was a mountain in the middle of our area and it had a special flower. That flower grew only on the grasslands of that mountain and also on Nelung [Tib. gnas lung], a mountain in Kongpo. That flower we call Tagsig Metog [Tib. stag gzig me tog]. Its root was like the root of onions. It grew in the middle of fields and the flower was orange color. They dug [out] the roots of the purple colored flower grown on the rocks of Nelung and put [it] into a box and took it with them when they returned. They also collected some other plants that were white like eggs and took lots of pictures. They stayed in that place for three days and then returned to India.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  Did they carry weapons?   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  No they did not.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  One or two people?   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  There were only two people, the Indian man and his interpreter.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  Did he claim that place belonged to India?   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  Yes, he said that. And after he finished his research, he returned to India. He had a map and we could understand the location of Garchag shiga. On the map, they indicated very clearly where the Lha, the deities and the nagas [Tib. klu] existed in that area. He gave me a picture of those. When I asked how they got those pictures, he answered that they had taken them from the airplane. Since then, the local people did not hand in taxes and the Tibetan government [The local government during his term] did not say anything about it.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  Did he speak Tibetan?   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  He knew a little. Mostly he spoke M&#xF6;npa or Lopa languages.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  The two languages are different from Tibetan, right?   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  Yes, they had their own languages. It was called M&#xF6;nke [Tib. mon skad]. For example, if we say &quot;Feed grasses to the horse&quot;, in term of their language it is &quot;Tapi achap&quot; [Tib. rta phi&apos; a chab?]. They would call the dzongp&#xF6;n, Dongdu&quot; [Tib. gdong &apos;du]. I was the Dzongp&#xF6;n of Garchag, so they would call me Garchag Dongdu. So mostly we did not know what they were saying. Their call meant Anye (Tib. a ni) and they said Alo [Tib. a lo] for butter. But all of them who came to my shiga knew Tibetan. In addition, they were very good looking, like Chinese. And they were much nicer than people in Kongpo. They were also very smart. Many people in Kongpo were kind of like idiots and many of them had goiters.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  What else did you do?   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  I told you about collecting the taxes. I did not know the specific number of taxes that we were collecting because it was the job of gembo and gadag to do it. So when I collected taxes, I asked them the number of taxes one should hand in and I did a little examination. Then the total taxes would be divided into each household&apos;s share.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  Did you have to go to that place?   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  No, I did not. I could not cross that dangerous bridge. If I could, I could then walk into the forest and would arrived in their village, but I could not pass the bridge. I had sent people twice to collect the taxes that should be handed in.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  What else did you do after you were 25 years old?   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  Oh! When I was 20 years old, Lhalu was the Governor of Kham, the Doji, and my younger sister was told to go to Kham to be the maid servant of Lhalu&apos;s wife. However, she was not in good health , so I went to say she was not able to come. After I arrived there, Lhalu kept me in there for about 18 days.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  When was that?   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  It was in 1950.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  How did you go there?   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  I rode horses and went through Kongpo. At that time I could impose the horse corv&#xE9;e tax on the local people. There was no highway. I stayed there for about 18 days and I helped the chandz&#xF6; of Lhalu to collect taxes. I did many things such as collecting taxes and copying the documents. After 18 days, I was sent to Derge [Tib. sde dge]. At that time, there was a chandz&#xF6; of Lhalu whose name was Tengba [Tib. steng pa]. He was in charge in the area of the ferry site, Gamtog Drukha [Tib. skam thog gru kha] on the Yangtse [Tib. &apos;bri chu] River. I helped that person until April of 1951. I went to Chamdo in the 8th month of 1950. The revolt was going to rise and the PLA was going to enter Tibet. All goods that those businessmen took from China needed to be checked. There were a lot of businessmen and we were required to check all goods and list them.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  Where were you? I mean were you on this side or that side of the Yangtse River?   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  This side of the river. I was on the side of Tibet. After the businessmen moved goods such as tea or other goods that were produced in Dartsedo to sell in Tibet, we checked them and listed them. There were two jobs: listing the goods and checking the people. People were saying that the PLA was going to enter Tibet, so we were checking all the people who came from China in order to make sure about security. We checked letters, documents and weapons that they probably hid under their clothes, especially letters.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  What did you find?   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  The businessmen usually would not hide things. They just took their goods, but we needed to check the pilgrims. We checked their whole body including their underwear. However, generally we did not find much. Some of them had handguns which was considered a part of their property. We did not find letters from them. We listed all of what we found and collected the taxes. The tax we collected was one box of tea from every 12 loads of tea. We collected cash for the other goods.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  Did anybody who was sort of famous came to that place?   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  No. On the other hand, a monk of Drepung Monastery, Lhade Khensur Rimpoche (Tib. lha sde mkhan zur rin po che) arrived there and a person who looked like a Chinese person came with him. His name was Jia Sai. When we checked his loads, there were a lot of gold biscuits that had been put into a box with some religious objects. We suspected that he was as a Chinese spy and we detained him for about two or three months. We reported this to Chamdo and Chamdo reported it to the Tibetan government. We thought he probably would be a Chinese spy. Later, he told us that he had come to Tibet many times because he was a monk. He knew many high ranking men such as Trendong [Tib. bkras mthong] and so on. After two months, we let him enter Tibet. Later I knew that his wife was the woman who was broadcasting in Lhasa. He acted like a religious person and for some time he managed an shiga in T&#xF6;lung [Tib. stod lung].   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  What was the name again?   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  He was called Jia Sai and his daughter was called Jia Liangdan. His first name was Jia. He was a tall man and used to pray and visit monasteries. That was the only strange thing that we had met there.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  Then what else?   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  If we passed a mountain pass from Gamtog Drukha to collect taxes, we would arrive in Derge Simda [Tib. ?] where there was a small custom office for collecting salt taxes [Tib. tshwa sho]. I worked there for about two months. However, there were no more taxes to collect. There were only a few loads of salt to be collected. Then I was told to come back to Gamtog Drukha. In 1951, the situation was very unstable. It was just before the disturbance involving Rup&#xF6;n B&#xFC;gang [Tib. sbud khang] occurred. I was sent to the Chinese territory [Tib. rgya sde] to collect taxes. So I went to Derge G&#xF6;nchen [Tib. sde dge dgon chen] and at that time, the Queen of Derge was there and I visited her. She also had a lot of tax deficits. She had a businessman called Lodr&#xF6; Gyatso [Tib. blo gros rgya mtsho] and she could not control him. So she sent me to the place where the businessman was living. I had a helper with me. We visited him and I understood he was a very rich man. After we arrived in his home, he said he needed one-week&apos;s time to collect his yaks that were grazing on the grasslands. He offered us a lot of white liquor [Ch. bai jiu]. He had many boxes of liquor. It was the liquor made in Xining. He put the liquor from bottles into a pot and served us. He also put a basin of crystal sugar on the table. I had a wooden bowl and the living room was furnished with a wooden floor. When he served the liquor, I acted as if I was drinking it, but when he left this room, I poured the wine from my bowl into crevices in the wooden floor as it was really hard to drink. We stayed there for four days and he served wine and good food to us. If we waited another three days, he could collect his yaks and something like thousands of boxes of tea would be sent to the Derge Queen. However, the person who was sent by the Queen with me said we should not stay there continually. He said if we stayed in there continually, we would be killed by him. My partner was so afraid that he did not want to stay there any more even though I told him that the businessman would not dare to kill us. I did not know the reason why my partner was so terrified, but I told the businessman that I did not have time to wait for him continually and when I asked him to come with us. He did. He rode a very good quality horse and came with us. After we arrived in Derge G&#xF6;nchen I lived in a guest house, and then I asked the Queen of Derge how many tea loads she got from the businessman. He actually did not give even one load of tea to her. He argued with her and blamed us because we did not wait for him for one week and he said that it was her [the Queen&apos;s] fault.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  How did you talk with them because you probably spoke &#xDC;tsang dialect but they must have spoken their dialect?   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  I could understand what they were talking about. He was very clever and it was very hard to get benefits from him. He dared to challenge the Derge King. All the capital of the King was said to be lost while under his control.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  Several thousand loads of tea?   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  Yes, right. Not only did they owe taxes to us, I heard that all the capital of the King was in his hands.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  What was next?   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  When he was arguing with the Queen, he gave me a load of tea and five rolls of silk. When he was talking with them, they did not have much power to deal with him. Then I returned to Gamtog Drukha.  When I arrived in Gamtog Drukha, all officials of the Custom Salt tax collection office were not there. They had already left and all the houses were empty. I had a saddle bag with me and I had taken some food from the Derge Queen because there was nothing to eat. After a time, the gyagp&#xF6;n of the border security guard [Tib. sa srung] came there and asked me what I was doing. I asked him where they had gone. He said, &quot;Do not stay alone in the empty house in which there is no food and drink. Come to my house.&quot; I asked, &quot;What are you doing here?&quot; I saw there were about 30-40 silversmiths making silver goods there. He told me that he was told to manage the silver factory and was told to close the factory. He would return to Tibet after his job was over. I stayed with the gyagp&#xF6;n for about five or six days, but his job was not going to be completed soon, so I left alone.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  What did they make?   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  They were making silver stands and lids of the bowls and silver saddles.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  Did it belong to Lhalu?   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  Yes. It was a private factory. He told me that he was not going to complete his job soon, so I should better leave by myself earlier.   </p>
