**A:**  Yesterday, we talked about a headman of
                    Yamdrog [Tib. yam 'brog] Trälham [Tib. bkras lham] who had fled, right?   

**Q:**  Oh, Yes. What's his name?   

**A:**  Trinley Phüntso [Tib. 'phrin las phun
                    tshogs]. He had a single hair knot [Tib. spa lcog] to show his rank. The lay
                    officials of the Tibetan government used to have two hair knots. At that time,
                    1958, a disease epidemic was affecting his village. This occurred pretty close
                    to the revolt. I went to that area to collect taxes in the 12th month of 1958
                    and when we were collecting taxes, we judged a lawsuit.  The
                    lawsuit was about the epidemic disease had been affecting the local people and
                    had caused many people's deaths. A medium came from another place and he went
                    through the motions of going into trance and gave the prophecy that they should
                    perform certain rituals, and he himself performed the rituals for them. However,
                    the people didn't recover from the illness and 1-2 people died in almost every
                    household. I heard that one household had probably four or five people who died
                    one after another. The medium had performed the rituals for the household. When
                    the last one passed away, the medium himself brought the body to the sky burial.
                    About 40 people died in the disease epidemic. Because of those reasons, the
                    villagers did not trust him and when we were in their village, people complained
                    saying, "The medium just went through the motions of going into trance and not
                    only didn't he cure the people, he caused more and more peoples' deaths.
                    Therefore, please don't let the medium stay in this place."   

**Q:**  What was his name?   

**A:**  I do not remember his name, but he was an old
                    man who was probably 50 years old.   

**Q:**  Did he belong to the Nyingma [Tib. rnying ma]
                    sect?   

**A:**  He was just an ordinary medium. Then I called
                    him and whipped him two hundred times and expelled him from the village [for
                    being a false medium]. Yesterday I told you about how another
                    man ran away, and I whipped him and he died. The root cause of this law case was
                    that there was a pasture for grazing animals under the Lhodrag's Senge Dzong
                    [Tib. lho brag seng ge rdzong] and the pasture adjoining that land belonged to
                    one our miser called Tsenru [Tib. btsan ru?]. Regarding this matter, Tsenru
                    filed a lawsuit to the local government or Lhalu, and then I received a letter
                    from Lhalu telling me to settle the matter. While I was trying
                    to settle the law case, there was a theft [of a horse and yak ] in a watermill
                    in that place. The victim of the theft was related to the household under the
                    Senge Dzong. The thief was a poor nomad who had a wife and a child but didn't
                    have any land. After the things were stolen from that household, the stolen
                    things came to be known. When I called him, he didn't confess so I whipped him
                    200 times and shut him up in prison. They were very poor and his wife came to me
                    and told me about the theft, but he didn't confess the theft. So I told him,
                    "The main thing was done by your leader [Tib. 'go khrid]. You are poor, so we
                    will not treat you badly, but you should confess the theft. If you confess, we
                    won't punish you." The wife told me that the leader who had ran away to Lhasa
                    had told her husband, "No matter how many times they would whip you, do not
                    confess. I will file a lawsuit [in Lhasa] and I will not let you down." He was
                    capable of filing law cases. So the nomad was scared and he didn't confess at
                    all.   

**Q:**  You whipped him 200 times, right?   

**A:**  Yes, He didn't scream when he was whipped.   

**Q:**  Did you take his pants off?   

**A:**  Yes, [but] they didn't whip him very
                    seriously. Later, one of his relatives told me that they applied eggs mixed with
                    the poison called Tsendug [Tib. btsan dug] and treated his wound, and they also
                    gave him some medicine [Tib. gnyan sman], but he died.   

**Q:**  What happened after that?   

**A:**  Later, he [the leader] said that he would go
                    to report the case to Lhalu. Lhalu thought that I had whipped him to death so he
                    reported to the Kashag that he didn't die because of the whipping, but rather
                    died from gonorrhea [Tib. gran gzhi] so they didn't ask me about that. Later, I
                    received a letter from Lhalu saying that they had settled the case in this way
                    and I didn't get punished. After that, I confiscated all of his belongings and
                    animals, and gave them to 8 people working on the estate, like the grain
                    measurer, the cook, the yak herder, the person who weighs things and the clerk.
                    I confiscated the horse stolen by the thief and one yak. In
                    the twelfth month, I finished collecting the taxes there and came back to Nyemo.
                    The place from where I collected the taxes was under Ling Dzong [Tib. gling
                    rdzong]. One of the tsodrag of Ling Dzong called Dochö Samden [Tib. rdo chos
                    bsam gtan] and the kudrak Lingwön Pema Kelsang [Tib. gling dbon pad ma skal
                    bzang] came to mediate the case, but that didn't work out. Pema Kelsang was the
                    estate manager and a very nice and humble person, though he was from a lay
                    official family. After I left that place, the other party
                    reported to Ling Dzong, and they called our misers and whipped them.   

**Q:**  Actually, did you have the authority to
                    collect the taxes?   

**A:**  Yes, I did. Normally, Ling Dzong would
                    receive the edict from the government and was the one in charge of the horse
                    corvée and those things, but I would collect the taxes in-kind.   

**Q:**  That was in 1958, right?   

**A:**  Yes. In the 12th month of 1958 I went back to
                    Nyemo. The revolt broke [out] in the March. At that time, I almost had to
                    confront the Ling Dzong head. So I sent a message to the 25 Trapchi soldiers who
                    were in Nangkartse [Tib. snang dkar rtse] as guards and I planned to confront
                    Ling Dzong. In the meantime, the revolt took place.   

**Q:**  Where were you when the revolt broke out?   

**A:**  I was in Nyemo [Tib. snye mo]. The Khambas
                    who were said to be the troops of Chushigandru blocked the highway between Nyemo
                    to Lhasa. So we were unable to go to Lhasa.   

**Q:**  Did some Khambas arrive in your village?   

**A:**  In 1958, some Khambas went from Drigu [Tib.
                    gri gu] to Shang Ganden Chöngor [Tib. shang dga' ldan chos 'khor] to get
                    [government] guns [stored there]. There were about a hundred or 50-60 Khambas.
                    At that time, the Preparatory Committee of the TAR [PCTAR] had been set up and
                    the People's Liberation Army had arrived [in Tibet]. Therefore, they [the PCTAR]
                    reported this to the County Level Bureaus [Tib. rdzong rim pa'i don gcod khang]
                    and the People's Liberation Army soldiers were sent from Markyang [Tib. mar
                    rkyang] and also from Chushul [Tib. chu shur] to Nyemo. Many soldiers arrived
                    and they trapped the Khambas in Nyemo's Mönkhar Dzong [Tib. snye mo smon mkhar
                    rdzong]. The Khambas were also blocked in Markyang and they fought there. This was probably on the 8th of the 8th Tibetan month. Since
                    we were situated on the other side of the river, we could hear the sounds of the
                    canons/ mortars. I heard that many People's Liberation Army soldiers were
                    killed, but we didn't see them. Even though many soldiers were killed, a great
                    number of PLA reinforcement came while the Khambas didn't have reinforcements. I
                    heard that the Khambas fought a lot in that place. I also heard that there were
                    soldiers from the Trapchi Regiment [among the Khambas]. Finally, the Khambas ran
                    away. They crossed the river in coracles from our homeland and went through the
                    road towards Drigu at the lower part of the valley. They didn't come to my
                    house, but I heard that two of the Khambas asked for lodging at the Pelung [Tib.
                    dpal lung] estate, which belonged to our estate. After that, they went to Paldi
                    [Tib. dpal di]. One of our Yagde miser [Tib. g.yag sde] called
                    Lhojangwa [Tib. lho byang ba] and the nomad Degye [Tib. sde brgyad] went to
                    Nangkartse to do trading, and they met up with the Khambas who robbed their
                    horses. Actually, they were misers of the Pelung estate. They should have come
                    to me, but they didn't come to me and went to Pelung estate. A Khambas who was
                    lodging in Pelung Shiga without consulting me, sent a letter to the other
                    Khambas because he knew them, and those Khambas returned the horses. If they had
                    come to me at that time, it would have been very dangerous to deal with the
                    Khambas because of the revolt, so I would have compensated them [the household
                    whose horses were robbed] from the estate and from the common miser. After that, the Khambas told the other Khambas, "The lodging
                    inn of Pelung Shiga which belongs to Lhalu [Tib. lha klu] had sent a letter, so
                    we had to return the horses." Then the Khambas sent a letter to us through the
                    two of them [the owners of the horses] at night saying, "Now we have already
                    eaten the barley from the 18 dzongs in Lhoka and now we are coming to take over
                    Lhalu's estate. Lhalu and his wife are getting 300 yuan each as a salary per
                    month from the Chinese." They didn't deliver this letter to me right away. If
                    they had delivered the letter to me right away and if the person was there, I
                    wouldn't have let him go and I would have whipped him. I would do that because
                    this was dangerous. But the person who delivered the letter had already left. So
                    [I thought that] if I would do too much and chase after him, the Khambas would
                    rise up.   

**Q:**  Who sent the letter?   

**A:**  The Chushigandru Khambas sent the letter
                    through the two people who came back with the horses. Otherwise, the Khambas had
                    left and we would not have been involved in the revolt. At that time, I didn't
                    know what to do. There were 16 estates under my management. Some of them
                    belonged to Lhalu and some of them belonged to other aristocrats and
                    monasteries. Therefore, I called a meeting of all the estate managers.   

**Q:**  Did you go there to arrange the meeting?   

**A:**  I stayed home. My house was located near the
                    estate. In the estate there was a place where the office was held and there was
                    another place where we used to stay before the office was held. I prepared for a
                    meal to be served to the estate managers coming to the meeting. I was the head
                    [Tib. spyi khyab] of the 16 estates and the estate where I was living was called
                    Khangsar [Tib. khang gsar] estate. Among the 16 estates, there was a monastic
                    estate called Barthang Pelrab [Tib. bar thang dpal rab] estate.   

**Q:**  Which monastery did that shiga belong to?   

**A:**  It belonged to Drepung. There was also
                    another monastic estate called Kharnga Shiga [Tib. 'khar rnga]. Bamo estate
                    belonged to the Drepung Jiso [Tib. 'bras spungs spyi bso] and Wang [Tib. dbang]
                    estate belonged to Kyentsal [Tib. skyed tshal] Monastery. Among the estates that
                    belonged to aristocrats, there was Bodrong estate [Tib. 'bod grong] and Barthang
                    Da estate [Tib. bar thang mda'] which belonged to Thönpa. Pecha estate belonged
                    to Thubden Gelek [Tib. thub bstan dge legs], this was a very small one. The
                    following shiga belonged to Lhalu: Metso [Tib. smad tsho] estate, Pelung estate,
                    Phusum [Tib. phu gsum] estate, Sakar [Tib. sa dkar] estate, Barthang Gongmo
                    [Tib. bar thang gong mo] estate, Yendrong [Tib. yan grong] estate, Je [Tib.
                    bye?] estate and Reu [Tib. dbre'u]. The other estates had to perform work for
                    their taxes, but I didn't need to work. However, I had to pay the barley taxes.
                    Among the estates mentioned above, Yendrong, Je and Reu used to be aristocratic
                    estates before they belonged to Lhalu [who got them] when Lhalu became Yabshi,
                    the family of the [12th] Dalai Lama. After they belonged to Lhalu, the previous
                    holders of these became Lhalu's subjects/servants and they could no longer wear
                    hair knots [Tib. spa lcog] like those worn by regular lay officials [two hair
                    knots on the head] and they had to pay about 500-600 khe of tax to Lhalu's
                    estate. These three shiga had about 20-30 miser households who had to pay a
                    little bit for the land lease, about 5-6-10 khe of barley to Lhalu. And they
                    also have to pay the remaining taxes to the three shiga.   

**Q:**  How many estates did Lhalu have altogether?   

**A:**  The above mentioned estates were under my
                    management. Altogether there were 9 estates in Yagde area, among these 9
                    estates, Pecha estate was exchanged with the Chushul Thongga estate [Tib. chu
                    shur mthong dga'].   

**Q:**  To which county did those estate belong?   

**A:**  They were under the jurisdiction of Rinpung
                    [Tib. rin spungs] County.   

**Q:**  Did those belong to Rinpung County in the
                    past?   

**A:**  No. In the past, they belonged to Nyemo
                    Mönkhar Dzong. During the reinvestigation of the reforms, theSE areas were
                    divided according to the two sides of Yarlung River. The other [south] side of
                    the river belonged to Rinpung and this side [north] of the river belonged to
                    Nyemo.   

**Q:**  When did they divide that?   

**A:**  It was in 1960. Actually, we were nearer to
                    Nyemo. It only takes a half day to reach Nyemo, but we had to cross a mountain
                    pass when we went to Rinpung and that took a whole day.   

**Q:**  Lhalu also had estates in other places like
                    Kongpo, right?   

**A:**  The above mentioned estates were only the
                    estates that were under my management. Basically, Lhalu had many other big
                    estates. In the past, Nyemo's Mönkhar Dzong also belonged to Lhalu, but later it
                    was offered to the government during the time of the Regent Reting. In the Nyemo
                    area there was the Sharam estate [Tib. shar ram], the Semo [Tib. zas mo] estate
                    in Sey [Tib. zas] area, the Yamda [Tib. yab mda'] estate, the Yamda Dekyi
                    Khangsar [Tib. bde skyid khang gsar] estate, the Jangyab [Tib. lcang rgyab]
                    estate in Phembo [Tib. 'phan po], which was a big estate, and the Tashi Thöndrub
                    [Tib. bkra shis don grub] estate in Lhoka.   

**Q:**  In which county was that?   

**A:**  At that time it was under Nedong [Tib. sne
                    gdong] County. In that shiga, there was a small estate called Lapa [Tib. la pa]
                    estate. There was Tashi Treling [Tib. bkra shis bkras gling] estate in Kongpo
                    and there was the Garchag estate, which was the biggest estate. It was where I
                    stayed. There was also an estate in Wölga [Tib. 'ol dga'] given to the Yabshi of
                    the 12th Dalai Lama which was called the Trungkhang [Tib. 'khrungs khang]
                    estate. There were 10 estates not including the 9 estates in Yagde. Lhalu was
                    the family of two Dalai Lamas and for the previous one [8th], many estates were
                    granted. And for the 12th Dalai Lama, they just added one more estate because
                    many estate had already been granted.   

**Q:**  After that, how did you celebrate the New
                    Year?   

**A:**  I celebrated the New Year in the estate in
                    Nyemo. After we received the letter from the Khambas, we prepared the things,
                    and it was probably on the 15th of the Tibetan 1st month when he Khambas came
                    and all of the estate managers went to receive them taking khata scarves.   

**Q:**  How many Khambas were there?   

**A:**  There were 15 of them. It was at the Yagde
                    Khangsar estate. At the beginning, we served tea to the Khambas and then I lent
                    the estate one load of butter to be given to the Khambas. They gave the butter
                    and a khata scarf to them. Otherwise, usually, they would collect the butter
                    from the miser.   

**Q:**  Did all of the Khambas carry guns?   

**A:**  Yes, they had guns and swords. I was told to
                    sit there and so I sat down there. We just offered the khata scarves and didn't
                    have anything to say so the other estate managers left. I ddn't know the
                    Khambas, but the lodging inn keeper knew them. [Among them],there was a gyagpön
                    and a magji who was from Amdo. All of the other 15 soldiers were from Markham
                    [Tib. smar kham].   

**Q:**  Was the Magji from Amdo?   

**A:**  He was from Amdo, but I don't know which part
                    of Amdo. All of them had killed people in the revolt. I heard that they did not
                    appoint someone a gyagpön until he had killed 100 people. I am not sure whether
                    or not he actually killed 100 people. Anyway, he was appointed as the gyagpön.
                    Then we served the Khambas tea and they also told them to serve me tea. Then
                    they asked me, "This estate belongs to Lhalu, right?" I said, "Yes." Then they
                    told me the same as they had written in the letter and said, "Lhalu and his wife
                    are getting 300 dayan as a salary from the Chinese per month. You are a
                    volunteer for Lhalu, right? So we are going to kill you." When
                    they talked about Lhalu, I got very angry. Two of the leaders were sitting on a
                    high seat and the other Khambas' faces became red and they were touching their
                    swords. Then I told them, "I am not a volunteer [worker]. In 1957, I was
                    appointed as the estate manager by force when I filed a lawsuit to the Office
                    for Settling Civil Disputes [Tib. gyod zhib las khungs]. As a result of this, I
                    accepted the job of collecting the taxes from the misers, settling civil
                    disputes and delivering the income to Lhalu. I didn't have any choice but to
                    accept to do those things. I did not volunteer. Otherwise, until now, there
                    hadn't been any talk about Chushigandru." Then they said, "Anyway, we are going
                    to kill you, seal the estate, and take away all the barley; and we are going to
                    move our regiment here." Then I told them, "It will not work
                    out if you do like this, because in this place hay for the horses and mules is
                    very scarce though we can give you barley for the fodder. Secondly, basically
                    the grain had belonged to Lhalu, but now it does not belong to Lhalu because
                    they had already sold the grain to repay loans to the Phurbujog [Tib. phur bu
                    lcog] Labrang [Tib. bla brang]. So please don't be like this." The Amdo was very
                    aggressive and they almost beat me up. Then the Khamba who had asked for lodging
                    on the estate told the other Khambas not to be like this; and he was more
                    powerful.  The Magji was like a crazy person and was trying to
                    fire his gun. Then they asked me whether I had a horse or not. I said, "I have
                    one horse." Then they asked me whether I had gun or not. I said, "I have one,
                    but I left it in Lhasa." They asked me how many guns I have. I said I have three
                    guns, two mausers and one Japanese rifle called Ripin Jagshub [Tib. ri pin lcags
                    shubs]. Here I have only two bullet cases consisting of 5 bullets each. All of
                    the other 200 bullets were left in Lhasa. In fact, I actually had a Mauser rifle
                    with me, but I took it to the monastery and hid it behind the statues. Then they
                    said that they wanted the bullets and [I] gave them to them.
                    Then they said that they were going to do the target shooting and asked me
                    whether I knew how to shoot. I said yes. They had different kinds of rifles,
                    like the 303 English carbine, and we did target shooting together. They said,
                    "You are a crack shot. You are going to challenge us [Tib. kha gtad bcag]." I
                    said, "No, this is not for challenging you. I just did target shooting for fun;
                    just like playing." When I stayed in Kongpo, I used to go hunting. After that, they kind of calmed down. The main thing was that
                    we entertained them well, so they calmed down. Then they told me to call all the
                    people in that area who make smoke rise [Tib. du ba gnam gtong] to a meeting
                    [i.e., every household large and small]. Being the chief of that area, I didn't
                    have any choice but to send the letter summoning the people. Then we called the
                    meeting at the big threshing field.   

**Q:**  How many misers got together at that time?   

**A:**  Probably, there were over 1,000 people. When
                    we count the villages, two of the villages had only one nomad household each.
                    Altogether there were 27 villages.   

**Q:**  How many households were there?   

**A:**  I don't remember that. The Khambas talked a
                    lot at the meeting. We didn't have any thoughts regarding the revolt. Before
                    that, the cadres from the China had come to that place to set up schools and
                    such things for the Preparatory Committee of the TAR. In
                    Rinpung County, they [Khambas] did many things and prepared for war by
                    recruiting people between the ages of 18-60. However, I told the people in our
                    area, "Do not meddle in those matters like setting up schools." This was a kind
                    of crime that I committed. Then I told them, "We won't be capable to make war.
                    You had better remain still because we didn't get any order from the local
                    [Tibetan] government. If we meddle in these matters without understanding them,
                    there would be trouble. We don't know what would happen and who is going to do
                    what. Do not say anything regarding opposing the Chinese. Whoever tells you
                    anything, just remain still. When the matter is settled in the future, it will
                    have a result whatever it may be."   

**A:**  The Khambas said that they are the Army to
                    Defend the Religion [Tib. bstan srung dmag sgar] and they have a great regiment
                    in Drigu [Tib. gri gu]. They were also talking badly about the Panchen Lama.   

**Q:**  What did they say?   

**A:**  They said, "The Panchen Lama is pro-Chinese.
                    He is like a Chinese spy. He is the same as the Chinese, and he is opposing the
                    Tibetans. So we are going to eliminate those people. All of you should have
                    solidarity and you are not allowed to use the ferry and coracles. You have to
                    seal them and you have to block the mountain pass." They took agreements
                    regarding this from each of the households.   

**Q:**  Did they talk about Tibetan independence?   

**A:**  They didn't say that, but actually, they
                    meant independence because they said, "We are going to eliminate the Chinese.
                    All of you should have solidarity and we should make war." At that time, the
                    agreement was written by Barthang Trinley [Tib. bar thang 'phrin las]. After
                    they put seals om the agreement, I was told to write my name at the bottom and
                    seal it. I said, "I am not going to put my seal on it." They said, "Why?" I
                    said, "I am not a miser. I am the chief [Tib. dpon po] and I am the person who
                    is giving the orders when I receive the orders from the local government and
                    Lhalu. I am the person who made the people do whatever I was told from above. If
                    I would put my seal on the agreement, I would have to take the responsibility
                    and I would have to bear the responsibility if the households would violate
                    something because I am the chief. According to present custom, there is no rule
                    telling me to seal the agreement. So please don't say this to me. You told me to
                    call the people, and didn't I send them letters? This is because I have the
                    authority to do that. Didn't I call all the people to come? I did whatever you
                    told me like getting the agreement from the people. I am not going to tell them
                    that they are not allowed to seal the agreement. But if I [sald] did this, it
                    would be a violation." The Khambas said, "That is not right."
                    Then I said, "They sealed the agreement so they will take responsibility. I will
                    not say anything bad to stop them from doing that." Like this, I [in the end]
                    didn't have to seal the agreement myself. After that, they
                    told me to take a person from the estate and seal the ferry and the coracles. I
                    couldn't refuse it, and I had to go there and take the coracles and the ferry on
                    this side of the river and seal them [stopping their use]. I was also told to
                    guard the mountain pass. I told the Khambas not to move to our place and they
                    just stayed for 5-6 days. During that time, we entertained them well and
                    supplied fodder for their horses and tsamba for themselves. Later, they didn't
                    insist on saying that they wanted grain. They wanted my horse, but I said that I
                    only had one horse. This was true. Then they told me to exchange the horse with
                    one of theirs, but I still refused to do that. So they didn't rob the horse or
                    any other things. One of the Khambas wanted me to sell him
                    some woolen bedding. I couldn't refuse this and he took it and asked me the
                    price. However, I told him I don't want any money for it. When their leaders
                    learned that, they said that "We have 20 points in our rules, so you are not
                    allowed to take the bedding. We are not robbing things from the misers, though
                    there were some Khambas that did that." And then they returned the woolen
                    bedding.   

**Q:**  What were the 20 rules?   

**A:**  They was for prohibiting robbing, drinking
                    beer, raping women and so on.   

**Q:**  Did they drink chang?   

**A:**  No, they didn't. Those Khambas were kind of
                    well-disciplined and they did not rob things. After that, they left and went
                    back. At that time they said, "If you don't accept the task of sealing the ferry
                    and coracles, our regiment will move to this place." I agreed to that and I also
                    said that "We will supply the fodder for the horses and tsamba if you want. But
                    I am not the only person supplying these things. Normally, I would collect them
                    from the misers and supply [to Lhaul] them when we would pay the taxes."  After that, some of the construction workers in Tashilhunpo
                    came to Nyemo and somehow they might have broken the seal on the coracle and
                    then met two Khambas in Rimpung. They were seized saying that they were Chinese
                    spies and they took them to Paldi [Tib. dpal di]. One of them was put on a cross
                    and [they] took him to the bank of the lake and killed him. The other was
                    whipped and hanged from the ceiling. After that, they sent me a letter saying,
                    "You have let the Chinese spies pass, so you, the estate manager, should come to
                    Paldi." This was probably on the 20th of the first month. Then I sent letters to
                    the estate manager and also the headman as the representative of the misers, and
                    we went to the Khambas on the 22nd. I don't remember the month. Altogether,
                    there were 150 Khamba soldiers with the same Magji, gyagpön and the 15 Khambas
                    who had come to our estate staying in the household called Dekhang [Tib. bde
                    khang] in Paldi. When we got there, they scolded us very
                    severely saying, "You sealed the agreement with us, but you let the Chinese
                    spies go through. We put one of them on a cross and killed him, and one of them
                    is there." When we looked down, he was absolutely naked and had been whipped on
                    his back and there were wounds on his back. He was hung up attached to the
                    ceiling with a grinding stone tied to his legs. He wasn't dead at that time.
                    Then the Khambas said, "We are also going to make you people become like him." I
                    was supposed to be the chief conspirator, so they told me, "You and the coracle
                    operator will be killed. Each of the others will be whipped 500 times." I begged for mercy and told them, "Please don't do this." The
                    other people also cried. I was extremely scared and shocked. I couldn't think
                    straight. I just thought something terrible was going to happen. At that time,
                    only the Amdo was drinking chang there. We didn't serve chang when they came to
                    the estate. He was drunk, and he took down a rifle and loaded it and tried to
                    shoot. Then I put on my cap and grabbed his rifle and pointed the gun to the sky
                    and told him, "Please don't do this. We have reasons to tell you. We didn't do
                    any lawless things." Then the other Khambas also told him not to do that and
                    they took his gun away. While they were cornering us in that
                    place, they received a letter saying that the Tsurphu Karmapa [Tib. mtshur bu
                    kar ma pa] Lama was coming. Then we were able to get through this, and they told
                    us to go home and that they would settle this tomorrow. Then they went to
                    receive the Karmapa Lama and there were, altogether, 150 riders carrying rifles.
                    We also went to see the Karmapa staying in some corners of the houses.   

**Q:**  Did you see the Karmapa?   

**A:**  Yes, the Karmapa arrived at Paldi at sunset
                    together with many retinue. Some of them were riding horses and some were coming
                    after yaks. On that night, the Khambas said that they were
                    going to hand us over to the lodging inn [Tib. gnas tshang ra sprod], which
                    meant that the lodging would have to keep watch on us for the night. However,
                    that night I went to see the Karmapa Lama and told him about what the had
                    Khambas done and I told him, "The Khambas told us to go to the lodging inn for
                    tonight because the Karmapa Lamais coming and that they will settle the matter
                    regarding us tomorrow. So please help us."  I knew Karmapa
                    from before when he came to our estate with Nenang Pawo [Tib. gnas nang dpa' bo]
                    Rimpoche. So he recognized me right away and said, "Pawo Rimpoche has already
                    left and Lhasa is finished and now there is nothing. Are you still staying like
                    this? Let's go together [to India]." But at that time I didn't know that the
                    revolt had been quelled. I never thought that the situation would be like this
                    and I told him, "Regarding leavimg, I have to do all the farming work and at
                    home there is my wife and children, and the children are all small. So I am
                    going to come later on. If you meet Pawo Rimpoche there, please tell him about
                    me." Usually, Karmapa would talk in a kidding way, but he showed me a kind of
                    serious look and said, "Oh! Are you really going to stay? There is not much
                    time, but I will tell the Khambas about that." Then I went back home. The Karmapa was going to leave the next morning and I was
                    called there, and the Khamba's magji and the gyagpön were also there. I was told
                    to sit there and the Karmapa said to me, "There will be no problem." But I was
                    still worried about what would happen. Then the Karmapa left, they called us and
                    and said things were okay. They said, "In accordance with your mistake, we
                    planned to kill you as we told you yesterday. But this time, the Karmapa gave us
                    the order [not to kill you] so we can't go against his order. Therefore, this
                    time your life is spared, but in the future [if you do that again] we will kill
                    you right away." We still didn't know about the revolt in
                    Lhasa and after that, the Khambas again came and stayed for 5-6 days in the
                    house of the headman called Dekyilinga. We supplied the fodder for their horses.
                    Altogether they came three times. When they came the last time, the People's
                    Liberation Army had already arrived at Ramba. On the 22nd of probably the fourth
                    month, the Khambas again left because they knew that the People's Liberation
                    Army had come to Ramba. So they ran away and the situation calmed down. After that, I received a notice [from the Chinese in Ramba]
                    about attending a meeting, but while all of the other names of the estates were
                    written there, the name of the estate where I was staying and my name were not
                    written. This letter was passed down to all the estates, and on the next day,
                    the meeting was held in Ramba. I didn't have any experience regarding the
                    revolution, but I had doubts and I thought that it was not alright if I didn't
                    attend the meeting, so I went to the meeting. When I got there, they asked me,
                    "Why are you here?" I said, "The other estates received a letter to attend the
                    meeting, but my name wasn't on there. I was wondering whether this was just an
                    omission so I came to ask about this." They told me to stay. The people involved
                    in the revolt in the Ramba area were shut up in jail. Then they held meetings
                    for a couple of days and served us food. One day, they [Chinese cadres] called
                    me. There were two People's Liberation Army soldiers standing there. They said,
                    "We will take over Lhalu's estates so you have to hand over the keys of the
                    estates to us."   

**Q:**  Who was the interpreter?   

**A:**  There was an interpreter called Powo Kelsang
                    [Tib. spo bo skal bzang] and a Chinese chief of staff [Ch. can mou] called Wang.
                    It was said that the interpreter used to be a monk in Tashilhunpo monastery.   

**Q:**  What was the rank of the military officer,
                    was he a Company Leader [Ch. lian zhang] or a Battalion Leader [Ch. ying zhang]?   

**A:**  I have forgotten that.   

**Q:**  How many People's Liberation Army soldiers
                    were there?   

**A:**  There were over 300 soldiers, and the leader
                    of the artillery unit was wearing a black coat. I didn't know anything about
                    quelling the revolt, so I said, "If I hand over the estates like this, I [first]
                    have to hand over the accounting [Tib. rtsis rgyag] to Lhalu." They said, "Don't
                    you know that Lhalu is a reactionary and has been imprisoned?" I said, "Anyway,
                    I have to talk with Lhalu. Otherwise, if I hand over the estates like this, in
                    the future they will make me become a beggar." They told me, "If you don't
                    accept this, we will send you to China." I said, "I don't care. I will go to
                    China." Then they said, "You will not meet your wife and children." I said,
                    "There is nothing for me to do even if I will not meet them."   

**Q:**  Did they say that they were going to send you
                    to jail in China?   

**A:**  They just said that they were going to send
                    me to China. They didn't say any other things. I told them, "You can send me
                    wherever you like to." They said, "Don't you have to go home?" I told them,
                    "Since you are going to send me to China, I have no thoughts [Tib. bsam rgyu
                    dran rgyu mi 'dug] so I just have to go wherever I will be sent." Then they
                    asked me what I was going to do now. I told them, "Please give
                    me a receipt. In the future, I can show this [to Lhalu]. If you give me a
                    receipt, I will hand over the estates to you. Otherwise, I can't bear the
                    responsibility for doing this." Then they said that they would give me a
                    receipt, and they wrote the receipt or certificate and sealed it with many
                    square shaped seals.   

**Q:**  Was it written in Tibetan?   

**A:**  No, it was Chinese.   

**Q:**  Didn't they translate the receipt?   

**A:**  Yes, they did.   

**Q:**  What did they write in the receipt?   

**A:**  It was written, "We took over the keys of the
                    estates that belonged to the reactionary Lhalu. The estate manager is not to be
                    blamed. In the future, whatever comments there will be [about the estate], they
                    should come to us and you are not allowed to cause trouble to him." The
                    interpreter asked whether this was okay. I said, "This is okay because I will
                    have something to show." Then they took all the keys of the estate and gave me a
                    cigarette and told me to think about it. I said, I don't have anything to think
                    about." They said, "Why?" I said, "I am in such a state of shock that I can't
                    think straight, but I am also not afraid." They then told the soldiers who were
                    carrying guns to go away and said, "Now it doesn't matter. You can take back the
                    keys, they [the officials] will do something about this in the future." At that time, all the leaders [the estate managers] were
                    called to the meeting and I was told to be a uyön (leader) of the Military
                    Administrative Committee [Tib. dmag srid; Ch. wei yuan]. They gave me a kind of
                    title. During that period, they didn't shut me up in jail. Later, when I got
                    close to the interpreter, he told me, "It was good that you came to the meeting
                    even though you didn't receive the notice. Otherwise, we would have made you
                    like the other people and shut you up in jail." Then they told me to go back [to
                    the estate] and said they would come later.   

**Q:**  How long did they hold the meeting?   

**A:**  It was about eleven days. During that time it
                    was like giving a party, using the things that they had confiscated.   

**Q:**  Did you have servants with you?   

**A:**  Yes, I had one servant.   

**Q:**  During that time, you didn't have any
                    connections with your home, right?   

**A:**  Yes. They [he cadres] wanted me to hand over
                    the documents distributed by the reactionaries so I sent my servants to get
                    them. I told them [the Chinese] that I didn't have any choice but to do whatever
                    the Khambas told me to do. After I went back hoome, the same
                    group of fifteen Khambas came to my house again. They probably didn't find a
                    place to run away to. I didn't keep them at home and I also didn't make any
                    arrangements for them on the estate. I just left them in the headman's house and
                    supplied them some fodder and I went there to see them.   

**Q:**  What did the Khambas say?   

**A:**  They told me, "You shouldn’t stay here. Let's
                    go and run away to India. We will escort you." I told them that I couldn't run
                    away because I had my wife and children. The Khamba was a kind of humorous
                    person and he told me to give him the woolen bedding. "They will take away all
                    your things when they implement the reforms so it is useless to think about your
                    wealth. You had better leave. As for us, the only way is to die." Some of them had five bullets and some of them had ten
                    bullets. They said, "After the bullets run out, then we have to die." The
                    Khambas stayed for about three to four days and then they left. The [Chinese] in
                    Ramba knew about that. After that, the Dzongpön of the Nyemo Mönkhar Dzong sent
                    the estate manager of the Trekhang [Tib. bkras khang] estate, which belonged to
                    Taktra Labrang [Tib. stag brag bla brang], and told me to deliver 500 khe of
                    barley to Mönkhar Dzong. After that, I was called to another
                    household where the interpreter and two officials came and said, "Where are the
                    reactionaries?" I said, "There are no reactionaries here." Then they searched
                    all the rooms in the house and the hay storeroom. The Khambas had left the day
                    before. When they couldn't find anything, they calmed down and we served them
                    noodles. They asked, "Where is the estate?" I said, "The estate is up there."
                    Then the interpreter blew a whistle and many soldiers came down from the
                    mountain and they told me to hand over the keys of the estate.  That night I went to open the doors of the estate. I was very tired when they
                    told me to carry down the carpets because I didn't have servants there. There
                    were 350 People's Liberation Army soldiers there and they fetched water and
                    boiled the water. On that day, they told me to call a meeting like the Khambas
                    haad done and they [Chinese] told me at the meeting, "The Khambas have been here
                    and there are people who had relations with them." They told me to go to the
                    Khambas and tell them to surrender. If they surrender, they will be given the
                    same status as they had before, like magji and gyagpön. They will not be
                    imprisoned and killed." I said, "I don't dare to go there because they will kill
                    me." They said, "They won't kill you because you were their friend." I said,
                    "Now, there is no longer any friendship. In the past, at the beginning, they
                    bullied us and then we got close with them. Now, the soldiers have arrived here.
                    So they will kill me or take me away with them." When they
                    told me to go with them, I refused to go. They [the Chinese] said, "They won't
                    kill you. If they take you with them, go with them and one day we will get you."
                    They gave me 200-300 for buying fodder for the horses and I took a servant and
                    went to the Khambas. When I arrived at Tsurphu, the Khambas had left for Phembo
                    [Tib. phen po] and I came back and told them that they had left. Then they
                    brought two yaks from the herd and slaughtered them. The soldiers had only rice
                    and salt. They were eating rice with salt in it.   

**Q:**  How long did it take for you to go to
                    Tsurphu?   

**A:**  It took four days. I stayed overnight in
                    Nyemo and then I crossed the mountain pass and came back. After that, the
                    situation had kind of calmed down, and the soldiers went back and I was told to
                    collect the weapons from all the estates. They said, "You are not allowed to
                    take your servants because until now, you have been the head [Tib. dpon po] and
                    you had servants in the past. Now you have to go alone." So I collected all the
                    guns. They were mostly Tibetan [matchlock] guns and swords and spears. I made a
                    list and took a kind of agreement and took these to Ramba.   

**Q:**  How many Tibetan guns were there?   

**A:**  There were about 200 guns and about 8,000
                    swords and daggers. I put all the documents in a trunk. I asked them [the
                    Chinese] to give me a receipt for the weapons. They said, "You don't need
                    receipts because we are working together." After that, the soldiers took me
                    together with 75 cavalry. We went day and night to wherever they received a
                    phone call telling them where the Khambas would be.   

**Q:**  Where did you go?   

**A:**  It was in the Paldi and Yagde areas. We also
                    went to Nangkartse when we heard that there were Khambas in that place, but then
                    come back at night. Finally, we heard that there were Khambas on the mountain
                    pass called Drelhe [Tib. 'dre lhad] and I went there with the People's
                    Liberation Army soldiers. The Khambas were shooting at us and the soldiers also
                    shot at them many times. After that, they {Khambas] ran away and disappeared.   

**Q:**  Did any soldiers die?   

**A:**  No, but there were casualties on both sides.
                    Then I heard that the Khambas ran away with their guns, but had left their
                    horses and food over there. After that, in the fourth Tibetan month, s Work Team
                    [Tib. las don ru khag] came to Nyemo and all of the estate mangers were called
                    to a study session. They were not prisoners. Altogether there were 140 people.
                    When the meetings [study sessions] were held, the officials came to the meeting.
                    Normally, the leader was a Chinese Director called Song Zhuren. She was about
                    17-18 years old with long hair. Now, she has retired. There was also the Chinese
                    cadre called Shucai. They were the leaders of the study session during the
                    daytime. At night, they handed them over to me. People from Nyemo used to go
                    home at night and I just let them go and told them to come back early in the
                    morning. I treated them leniently and they also were able to drink beer.
