## Abstract  

 W.D. Shakabpa [Tib. zhwa sgab pa] was a very prominent aristocratic government official who held the rank of Tsipön. He is the author of "Tibet: A Political History." In this interview, he describes how the drungtsi operated between the Kashag and the Tsondu. Shakabpa tells about how the Deshib Office headed by Bumtang and Namseling spied on the Communist and Guomindang Chinese and how the government expelled them with the agreement of the Tsondu. Shakabpa describes in detail the Tsondu meeting that was held to show gratitude to Reting for his recognizing the reincarnation of the new Dalai Lama and how Lukhangwa confronted the abbots of the great monasteries at this meeting saying that the Tsondu should not offer government estates to Reting as a reward. He discusses how Dombor attacked Kapshöba for secretly making changes to the Tsondu's resolution without consulting the other drungtsi. Shakabpa tells about the famous incident when Reting demoted Künsangtse from the Tseja office and how the Shagor Khembo cried in the Tsondu regarding the need for banning soccer in Lhasa.

**A:**  If there were any political affairs that the Kashag couldn't decide, normally they would hand them over to the drungtsi and tell them to discuss the matters.   

**Q:**  Usually, when they discussed issues, would the drunyichemmo go to the tsipön or what?   

**A:**  There were separate places for the drungtsi to have their meetings. One was in the Potala in a hall called Sasum [Tib. sa gsum] and another was in the Jokhang in a room on the Labrangteng [Tib. bla brang steng].   

**Q:**  Would they tell you to hold a meeting of the drungtsi?   

**A:**  Yes they would. We wouldn't know what the meeting was for. After the drungtsi got together, they would go to the Kashag and ask them what the meeting was for. Then the Kashag would tell them the content of the meeting. Then the drungtsi would discuss the matters. They would consult with the Kashag if it was necessary to ask them their opinion. The Kashag would tell their opinion and they would decide the matters which could be decided and the decision would be submitted to the Regent. If there was something that Kashag and drungtsi couldn't decide, the tsondu would be the place where they would wash their hands of the matter [Tib. lag pa phis sa]. Then the tsondu hragdu gyepa assembly would be held and there were some people who regularly would attend this assembly meeting. And there could be an abbreviated tsondu hragdu gyepa. I think the drungtsi was considered as the abbreviated Tsondu hragdu gyepa. Otherwise, there wasn't any other abbreviated Tsondu. There was also the Tsondu gyendzom.   

**Q:**  Would the shape attend the Tsondu gyendzom?   

**A:**  No, they wouldn't. But the officials who had the position called kungö denthob [Tib. sku ngo'i gdan thob], a rank almost equal to the kalön, would attend.   

**Q:**  Did the tsipön have the Kungö Denthob rank?   

**A:**  No. The drunyichemmo also didn't have that. The drungtsi were like a bridge between the Kashag and the Tsondu delivering messages back and forth. When assembly meetings were held, they would usually supervise how the discussions were going on between the Kashag and drungtsi, and the drungtsi would make the decision statement [Tib. tsig tho] on the matter that was agreed upon by the majority (at the meeting).   

**Q:**  Would the drungtsi read the statement on the meeting?   

**A:**  Yes, they would consult whether it would be okay to make that decision and people would give their opinions on whether they agree or disagree. After that, they would submit this statement [to the Regent]. When there were important matters, the Kashag and the drungtsi would hold meetings at night.   

**Q:**  In your time, you had to hold many meetings, right?   

**A:**  Yes. For example, like regarding the resignation of Langdün [Tib. glang mdun] and the Reting events and the Sera disturbance at Lhundrup Dzong [Tib. lhun grub rdzong]. When the Sera Jey [Tib. sera byes] supported this matter and the monks didn't come to take their seats at the Mönlam [Tib. smon lam] Prayer Festival, we had to hold a lot of meetings. When expelling the Chinese, we also had to hold meetings.   

**Q:**  When you expelled the Chinese, didn't you all, Kungö, put the Buddha statue made of turquoise on your heads and take an oath?   

**A:**  No, no, we didn't.   

**Q:**  I mean the kalön did that, right?   

**A:**  The kalön might have done that, but we didn't do that. Where was the statue of the Buddha that was made from turquoise?   

**Q:**  I heard that it was in the Kashag.   

**A:**  Probably, there wasn't one like this. I have never heard about it.   

**Q:**  You only had the statue of the Avalokitsevara, right?   

**A:**  There was a statue of the Fifth Dalai Lama and Tsongkapa and the 7th Dalai Lama Kelsang [Tib. skal bzang] and later, there was also a statue of the 13th Dalai Lama.   

**Q:**  I heard that Kapshöba was there when the turquoise Buddha statue was there.   

**A:**  Kapshöba was there. It was just after he became a kalön.   

**Q:**  I heard this was the cause of Kapshöba's demotion.   

**A:**  I am not sure about this.   

**Q:**  They were thinking of doing that [expelling the Chinese], but Namseling [Tib. rnam sras gling] took the responsibility of doing that. Is that true?   

**A:**  It was Namseling and Drunyichemmo Chömpel Thubden [Tib. chos 'phel thub bstan] who were the in charge of the Office Investigating Law Cases, the Deship Office. The Deship probably went through the motions of setting up spies.   

**Q:**  What was the main responsibility of the Deship Office?   

**A:**  It probably was in charge of security. So the Deship had set up spies to spy on the Guomindang Chinese. A restaurant was opened somewhere in Lhasa and probably many kudrak were also going to that restaurant. Later, I came to know that our Khenjung [Trekhang] Samchog-la [Tib. bsam mchog lags] had also been there. I heard that during the Mönlam when the Dalai Lama attended the Mönlam, many tsidrung used to go to that restaurant. Actually, this was a communist restaurant. They [Deship] watched who was coming to the restaurant and came to know that Bapa Phüntso Wangyal [Tib. 'ba' pa phun tshogs dbang rgyal] and those people were coming. They also might have had an inner room to hold meetings and they knew that the Communist spies were gathering in there and they also had connections with the Guomindang spies. So all of them were arrested all of a sudden.   

**Q:**  I heard that at the beginning this was caused by the Deship Office. At first, the Deship reported this to the drungtsi and then the drungtsi reported it to the Kashag, right?   

**A:**  The Deship didn't report to the drungtsi, they reported to the Kashag and the Kashag passed things down to the drungtsi. At that time, the drungtsi didn't dare to touch it so they convened the Tsondu and brought all the members of the Tsondu [to Lhasa]. The Tsondu meeting was held in Norbulinga. At the meeting it was agreed unanimously that according to the situation in China, it would be correct to expel the Chinese. By that time, the drungtsi and the Kashag had already agreed upon that. Except for a few people, all the members of the Tsondu spoke about that matter.   

**Q:**  The abbot of Drepung's Gomang College [Tib. 'bras spungs sgo mang] said that he was going to send monks and was going to do such and such things. [not clear].   

**A:**  After awhile, they said that if we agree upon this, it is good and all of the members of the Tsondu should go up. Actually, they needed to show the Chinese that this was agreed to unanimously by the Tsondu. Then all of the members of the Tsondu came to Lhasa.   

**Q:**  All of them might not have had horses, right?   

**A:**  Yes, all the members, regardless of having horses or not, came up to Lhasa and held the meeting in the Jokhang and they decided it on that day.   

**Q:**  Did they arrest them on that day?   

**A:**  There wasn't any arrest. They didn't arrest even a single person. They just gave a notice to the Chinese representatives that they must leave within a week. They sent the notices and some of the Chinese were handed over to be under the supervision of their landlords or their inn-keepers "like attaching the needles to the collar" [Tib. gnas tshang kgab gong gzer].   

**Q:**  Even the Chinese representative was sent back, right?   

**A:**  Yes.   

**Q:**  This was in 1948-49, right?   

**A:**  Yes. On that day, the drungtsi were at the front followed by the members of the Tsondu riding their horses. They came to the Jokhang and all the people were watching and wondering and were apprehensive saying what are they going to do.   

**Q:**  Probably, the turquoise Buddha statue might be in the Deship Office which they used for taking the oath.   

**A:**  Probably not. I don't have any idea about the Kashag and Seshib taking an oath.   

**Q:**  I heard that this was the reason for Kapshöba getting demoted, because probably he had said (leaked) something about it.   

**A:**  Kapshöba was treated severely by Taktra but I don't know why. And Reting also treated Khyungram severely [Tib. nan po]. Many things happened among the kudrak and Künsangtse was also demoted from his post as Laja head.   

**Q:**  Why was he demoted?   

**A:**  There was a lot of talk regarding this matter. Probably when he was the dzong head of Nagchu [Tib. nag qu 'go pa], he treated Reting's traders aggressively when they were doing trading. Then when he was the Laja head, when Reting Labrang sent some people to get something, he said something sassy. Khyungram was demoted because he said the proverb, "Not being full even after eating the mountain and not being quenched even after drinking the ocean." [Tib., ri bo zos nas ma 'grangs/ rgya mtsho btungs nas ma ngoms/]. He definitely said that. I was there.   

**Q:**  I heard that the Töpa [Tib. stod pa] Khembo altered (the meaning of) [Tib. sgyur] this talk. What was the name of this Khembo?   

**A:**  He was called Gomdzö Chöndze [Tib. go mdzod chos mdzad]. Lukhangwa [Tib. klu khang ba] was the senior gadrung, the gadrung chemmo [Tib. bka' drung chen mo].   

**Q:**  Usually, would the gadrung chemmo attend the Tsondu?   

**A:**  Yes, he would. He was one of the representatives of the Tsondu. I was the tsipa of the Tsikhang [Tib. rtsis pa] then. Actually, Lukhangwa's title was higher, but he used to sit with the Fifth Rank officials, the Letsenpa [Tib. las tshan pa] and wore a purple color brocade chupa. It was strange. He was sitting near to me and near to that there was the bearded Kamekang Gyaula [Tib. dkar me khang rgya'u lags]. The abbots and Lukhangwa argued with each other a lot.   

**Q:**  How did they confront each other?   

**A:**  Lukhangwa said, "It isn't okay to offer government estates to Reting. We are grateful to Reting so we should pull out the hair from our own noses [Tib. sna khung nang gi spu 'thog] [which means we should offer estates from the kudrak]. Otherwise, it would become like the proverb, "the Lama's robe will become finished when people take little pieces of it as a blessing [Tib. bla ma'i na bza' 'thog 'thog gis zad] [the government's estates would be finished if we give little by little to Reting, etc]. Khyungram also said the proverb about the ocean. Kamekang was very critical that this was aimed at Reting and was a great offense to Reting. At that meeting, the Drunyichemmo Ta Lama [Tib. ta bla ma] Ramba, Dombor [Tib. gdong por] and Chömpel Thubden were there. Then there were the Tsipön, Kapshöba, Shelkarlingpa [Tib. shel dkar gling pa] and Driyü [Tib. 'bri yul]. Since there were serious arguments, it took a long time to conclude the meeting. It was said that we should decide the matter that very night for otherwise the (content of the) talks would become known widely. Finally they decided to offer [Reting] 4-5 estates like Bodong Tashigang [Tib. bo dong bkra shis sgang], Gyantse Lungmar [Tib. rgyal rtse lung dmar]. Then they told the members not to go away and Kapshöba made the draft on a Samdra writing board. Lukhangwa told Kapshöba to hold on, and made some suggestions, and then he stopped for awhile and made some more suggestions. He was acting like a deity giving prophecies through a medium/oracle. Like this, they made a very good draft statement [Tib. tshig zin]. Then the members told them to read it again and all of them agreed to it saying it was well done. Then Ngawang Thöndrub, Angula [Tib. ngag dbang don grub, am gug lags] and I were told to come in early the next morning to copy the statement. They also said that all the drungtsi will come and they told the members of Tsondu to come at a fixed time, like 11-12 a.m.   

**Q:**  Did they hold the meeting in Norbulinga?   

**A:**  No, it was held in the Jokhang's Labrangteng. Then the meeting was over and the two of us went there at around 8-9 a.m. At that time, nobody was there. Although I was the one in charge of keeping the documents, I was not allowed to break the seal of the document box unless one of the drungtsi was present. Then Kapshöba came and broke the seal on the box and took out the draft statement. Then one of us prepared the paper [on which the decision was to be written]. Before we copied the statement, Kapshöba read the draft and made some changes. So the two of us were saying that Lukhangwa would argue with doing that and we were wondering what kind of changes Kapshöba made because we didn't know. Then we were told to copy it, but we acted slightly reluctant for awhile. We just started copying the heading of the draft, hoping that the kung [rest of the officials] would come. Then the drungtsi and some of the representatives like the abbots also arrived. After that, tea was served and we ate bag. Drunyichemmo Chömpel Thubden handed the draft of the statement written on the samdra to Dombor while eating his bag. Then Dombor recognized Kapshöba's handwriting and he screamed while kneading his bag and used the term for scolding people, "Key Kapshöba! Behave yourself! Otherwise we might have to cut off your hands!" Oh! My. Three jewels! Then Kapshöba said, "What happened?" Dombor said, "Who wrote this?" Kapshöba said, "I wrote it." Then Dombor said, "We didn't discuss this last night. Go call Lukhangwa and ask whether we had wording like this or not." Lukhangwa was in the Kashag office. As far as Dombor was concerned, he didn't regard the members of the assembly as humans. Oh! My. Three Jewels! Kapshöba was kind of funny and said, "I am sorry! I made this correction. I will just rub it off." and he rubbed it off. When Lukhangwa came, things had already calmed down and the statement drafted last night was confirmed. When Dombor read the draft, he was trembling [with anger]. Right at that time, Angula told me [joking], "He is going to go into trance." Right after that he screamed out as I mentioned above, holding his hand with bag on it. As far as I am concerned, I can't remember what kind of the corrections were made, but the drunyichemmo remembered what was in the draft and what changes were made.   

**Q:**  You, kung, tried to delay copying the draft because of the correction, right?   

**A:**  Yes. We were afraid thinking something [bad] would happen. The other tsipön like Driyü and Shelkarlingpa didn't say anything, although all of them read the draft. Chömpel Thubden waited for Dombor to come and then when he came in he didn't say anything. They were all smart. It was Dombor who said things openly. That was the time when the song came out with the words, "The bear [Dombor] had pimples on his face and the Naga [Lukhangwa] got offended. The garuda's claws had something happen [cut off] [Tib. dom la thor pa skes nas klu la gnod pa btang/ khyung gi sder mo] [the wording is incomplete]   

**Q:**  Yes, there was such a song with that wording, "The Naga was offended and the bear got pimples on his face and something happened to the garuda's claws [Tib. klu la gnod pa 'khyol bas dom la thor pa don song]. Soon after that Dombor became a khenche [Tib. mkhan che] [a powerless position] and couldn't do anything.   

**A:**  Just after that, I had to go to Lukhangwa and when we were chit-chatting while having bag together with fried beef and pickles. I told him, "If you speak very strongly at the meeting, it might cause you trouble." By that time, Lungshar's eyeballs had already been gouged out. He said, "Even if my eyeballs would be gouged out and I would have to beg for food under the Yuthok Bridge, if people would then ask who I am, when they know that I am Lukhangwa, they would give me 1 sho, instead of giving me the 5 karma [Tib. skar ma] that they are supposed to give. And they would say that his eyeballs were gouged out because he worked for the government." He was so courageous.   

**Q:**  He must have had great enthusiasm.   

**A:**  This was something that I had seen and heard and was involved in, though I did not have any power.   

**Q:**  This meeting was for offering estates to Reting to express gratitude for confirming the reincarnation of the Dalai Lama, right?   

**A:**  Yes.   

**Q:**  At the beginning, it was the Töpa Khembo [Tib. stod pa mkhan po] who was the person who raised the talk [about Khyungram], right? Before that, was he almost appointed as the abbot of the Jey [Tib. byes pa] or Ngagpa [Tib. sngags pa] colleges in Sera. He had a lot of trouble when the abbot of Sera Mey [Tib. se ra smad] didn't accept him, right?   

**A:**  Yes, there was a lot of talk about him. I don't have any idea about this. Later he also became an ex-abbot and there was another abbot.   

**Q:**  This might be after Reting became the ex-Regent?   

**A:**  Probably, it was before the Reting became the ex-Regent.   

**Q:**  What was the reason for that?   

**A:**  Probably Reting did that to warn him to be careful because he did something too extreme [Tib. thal che ba] and this abbot always didn't get along well with Lukhangwa. He was called Jungnela [Tib. 'byung gnas lags] and had a white complexion.   

**Q:**  I remember he was tall and thin.   

**A:**  When he would talk, he would frequently use the word "candidly/frankly", Ngö ngö Jenjen [Tib. dngos dngos rjen rjen]. So we nicknamed him "Ngöngö Jenjen."   

**Q:**  That was not Jungnela. Jungnela was very eloquent.   

**A:**  There was another abbot called Shagor Khembo [Tib. shag sgor mkhan po] who looked like a nun. He cried at the meeting.   

**Q:**  Why did he cry?   

**A:**  He cried, saying that people were playing soccer.   

**Q:**  Was he the person who cried?   

**A:**  Yes. [laughter]   

**Q:**  Why the hell was he doing these reckless things? [Tib. mi byed rgu byed tsha la] Actually, he didn't have any knowledge of the scriptures.   

**A:**  He was like a nun.   

**Q:**  The Lama called Shagor Khentrul [Tib. shag sgor mkhan sprul] who is now in Switzerland was a pupil of Shagor Khembo shagtsang (monk's household). After the former abbot was the abbot for 18 years, he became the abbot. But he didn't have any knowledge of the scriptures. Basically, many of the abbots put pressure [on him] regarding the matter of playing soccer, but Shagor Khembo was the one who cried and said, "At this time when Buddhism is declining, people are kicking the Buddha's head."   

**Q:**  It was a ball not the Buddha's head.   

**A:**  I wonder who said what to give him this kind of impression.   

**Q:**  Did he cry loudly?   

**A:**  Yes, he did. So soccer was banned in an urgent manner. It was at the same time when they closed the schools. They had this talk in one day.   

**Q:**  I still don't know how they stopped the schools and why the Tsondu stopped it.
