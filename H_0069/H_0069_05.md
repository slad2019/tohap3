**Q:**  Usually, the jigyab <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. མཁན་པོ] Abbot of a monastery or monastic college.">khembo</a> would follow the Dalai Lama wherever he went. Did he have a separate office, or would he just stay in the palace?   

**A:**  His office was in the Khembotsang. Most of the time when he would go to his office, he would probably go to the treasury, the Dzöbu.   

**Q:**  Where did they hold the Dzöbu?   

**A:**  It was held in the palace called Kelsang Dikyi [Tib. སྐལ་བཟང་བདེ་སྐྱིད].   

**Q:**  Was that the palace called Kelsang Phodrang [Tib. སྐལ་བཟང་ཕོ་བྲང], located inside the yellow wall?   

**A:**  No, it was located in the back of the Jensel Phodrang [Tib. སྤྱན་བསལ་ཕོ་བྲང]. There probably was also a Dzöbu in the Potala.   

**Q:**  Did the jigyab <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. མཁན་པོ] Abbot of a monastery or monastic college.">khembo</a> also have a work hostel [Tib. ལས་ཤག] in the back of the Kelsang Dikyi Palace?   

**A:**    

**Q:**  Who else was there in the Dzöbu? Were the Dalai Lama's personal attendants like the one in charge of clothes, the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. གཟིམ་དཔོན] An honorific term for a servant or personal attendant.">simpön</a> khembo [Tib. gzim dpon mkan po], in the Dzöbu?   

**A:**  No.   

**Q:**  The jigyab <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. མཁན་པོ] Abbot of a monastery or monastic college.">khembo</a> and the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཕྱག་མཛོད] A senior manager/treasurer of an aristocratic or monastic estate, or the senior manager/treasurer of an aristocratic family or a monastic unit. Generally chandzö handled both internal and external issues and were considered higher in power and status than nyerpa (stewards), who typically only handled the storerooms.">chandzö</a> were there, right?   

**A:**  The <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཕྱག་མཛོད] A senior manager/treasurer of an aristocratic or monastic estate, or the senior manager/treasurer of an aristocratic family or a monastic unit. Generally chandzö handled both internal and external issues and were considered higher in power and status than nyerpa (stewards), who typically only handled the storerooms.">chandzö</a> was not there.   

**Q:**  There were some staff of the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. རྩེ་དྲུང] A monk official in the Tibetan government.">tsidrung</a> [leja, Tib. las bya] and <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཨེ་པ] Miser conscripted as a corvée tax to work for the Tibetan government as a scribe copying documents.">epa</a>, who copied documents, right?   

**A:**  Yes.   

**Q:**  Later on, was there an office called the Private Office of the Dalai Lama [Tib. སྐུ་སྒེར་ཡིག་ཚང]? Ta lama [Tib. ཏ་བླ་མ] (Jawdang [Tib. ལྕོག་སྟེང]) and later, Tarala [Tib. རྟ་ར་ལགས], were the secretaries of the Private Office, right? There were only <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. རྩེ་དྲུང] A monk official in the Tibetan government.">tsidrung</a> in that office, right?   

**A:**  This was later on in India.   

**Q:**  In the early times, it was not there, right?   

**A:**  Yes.   

**Q:**  What about the duty of the Drönyerchemmo?   

**A:**  He worked in the Gag.   

**Q:**  What would he do in the Gag?   

**A:**  His job was to submit the petitions to the Dalai Lama, and bring down the petitions and pass down the orders.   

**Q:**  What was the job of the personal attendants—kujar?   

**A:**  They were the three personal attendants in charge of serving food, in charge of the clothes, and in charge of the religious utensils of the Dalai Lama, Sösimchösum: the Söpön Khempo, the Simpön Khembo, and the Chöpön Khempo [Tib. མཆོད་དཔོན་མཁན་པོ].   

**Q:**  I mean the personal attendant, <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. སྐུ་བཅར] 1. A favorite. Someone who works/stays in the close presence of another important figure. 2. The name commonly used for Kumbela (tib. ཀུན་འཕེལ་ལགས), the favorite of the 13th Dalai Lama who became politically powerful during the later period of the 13th Dalai Lama&#x27;s reign.">kujar</a>, of the 13th Dalai Lama.   

**A:**  The <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. སྐུ་བཅར] 1. A favorite. Someone who works/stays in the close presence of another important figure. 2. The name commonly used for Kumbela (tib. ཀུན་འཕེལ་ལགས), the favorite of the 13th Dalai Lama who became politically powerful during the later period of the 13th Dalai Lama&#x27;s reign.">kujar</a> served the Dalai Lama in his room and when the Drönyerchemmo came, he probably first told the kujar. And the kujar reported to the Dalai Lama that the Drönyerchemmo had come. Therefore, the kujar was involved in that. This was his duty.   

**Q:**  So it became like they had to go through <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. སྐུ་བཅར] 1. A favorite. Someone who works/stays in the close presence of another important figure. 2. The name commonly used for Kumbela (tib. ཀུན་འཕེལ་ལགས), the favorite of the 13th Dalai Lama who became politically powerful during the later period of the 13th Dalai Lama&#x27;s reign.">kujar</a> every time, right?   

**A:**  Yes.   

**Q:**  The Dalai Lama might have had many rooms. I have never seen the rooms of the Dalai Lama. The room might have been a big one. So would the Drönyerchemmo have to stand near the door or what?   

**A:**  I also have never seen that. In the Gag, there was a place for the Drönyerchemmo to sit down.   

**Q:**  Actually, the Dalai Lama's room was not right inside the Gag, right?   

**A:**  Yes, there was an official, functional big hall inside the Gag. I remember that the Drönyerchemmo and the tsendrön would sit on the right side of the Gag. On the other side, the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. རྩེ་དྲུང] A monk official in the Tibetan government.">tsidrung</a> bodyguards [Tib. གཟིམ་འགག] were probably seated. The Drönyerchemmo's office was in the Gag.   

**Q:**  Were the doors made of wood?   

**A:**  Yes, the wood doors were always closed.   

**Q:**  Did they have to knock at the door?   

**A:**  No, the door was just left like that. It was not absolutely closed.   

**Q:**  When you opened the door, was that the room where the Dalai Lama was or was there another room?   

**A:**  The functions were there. It was a big hall.   

**Q:**  He may have been there, right?   

**A:**  Yes, there was a big hall for the functions.   

**Q:**  So when you opened the door, that's where the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. སྐུ་བཅར] 1. A favorite. Someone who works/stays in the close presence of another important figure. 2. The name commonly used for Kumbela (tib. ཀུན་འཕེལ་ལགས), the favorite of the 13th Dalai Lama who became politically powerful during the later period of the 13th Dalai Lama&#x27;s reign.">kujar</a> were, right?   

**A:**  The <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. སྐུ་བཅར] 1. A favorite. Someone who works/stays in the close presence of another important figure. 2. The name commonly used for Kumbela (tib. ཀུན་འཕེལ་ལགས), the favorite of the 13th Dalai Lama who became politically powerful during the later period of the 13th Dalai Lama&#x27;s reign.">kujar</a> didn't come in there at all. I don't think so because it was an official functioning place.   

**Q:**  When someone wanted to go for a blessing, they had to go there, right?   

**A:**  When people would go there, the Drönyerchemmo was always there and they had to contact him. When there was no function, Kujar may have been with the Dalai Lama wherever he was, like in his room or in the garden.   

**Q:**  If someone wanted to send a message?   

**A:**  They looked for the kujar.   

**Q:**  When the Drönyerchemmo had something to report to the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. སྐུ་བཅར] 1. A favorite. Someone who works/stays in the close presence of another important figure. 2. The name commonly used for Kumbela (tib. ཀུན་འཕེལ་ལགས), the favorite of the 13th Dalai Lama who became politically powerful during the later period of the 13th Dalai Lama&#x27;s reign.">kujar</a>, he sent a sweeper [Tib. གད་པ], right?   

**A:**  Yes.   

**Q:**  When there was a function, did the Dalai Lama attend the function every day, or did the regents get together with the Dalai Lama and talk about state business every morning? Was there a certain time or what?   

**A:**  Not every morning, it was from time to time.   

**Q:**  If someone wanted to send a petition, could they have sent it directly to the Dalai Lama?   

**A:**  No, they couldn't do that. They had to go through proper channels according to tradition.   

**Q:**  How did they go to the Kashag and the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཡིག་ཚང] The highest office dealing with monastic and religious affairs in the traditional Tibetan government. It is often called the Ecclesiastic Office. It was headed by 4 fourth rank monk officials called Trunyichemmo. The senior Trunyichemmo was called Ta Lama.">Yigtsang</a>?   

**A:**  When you made an appeal to the Kashag, the Kashag would deliberate and then ask for different officials.   

**Q:**  Would they finally send it up to the Dalai Lama?   

**A:**  If it was an important matter, all the kalön would go together and discuss. If it was not important, an individual kalön would go. If it was even less important, the Kashag would send a <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. བཀའ་མགྲོན] Administrative aide to the Kashag. There were usually two or three of these, all of whom were aristocratic lay officials.">kandrön</a> and give it to the Drönyerchemmo, and he would submit it to the Dalai Lama. When the 13th Dalai Lama was in the garden and someone saw him, they couldn't talk to him directly, not even the Drönyerchemmo. They had to tell the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. སྐུ་བཅར] 1. A favorite. Someone who works/stays in the close presence of another important figure. 2. The name commonly used for Kumbela (tib. ཀུན་འཕེལ་ལགས), the favorite of the 13th Dalai Lama who became politically powerful during the later period of the 13th Dalai Lama&#x27;s reign.">kujar</a> and the kujar would report it to the Dalai Lama.   

**Q:**  The Drönyerchemmo probably could not report it immediately when he met the Dalai Lama, right?   

**A:**  Yes, it was a custom of the Tibetan government that people couldn't talk immediately when they would met the Dalai Lama, even when they were going to do something for the government. They would stop there and prostrate or do something. This was their kind of character.   

**Q:**  Did the regents also have <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. སྐུ་བཅར] 1. A favorite. Someone who works/stays in the close presence of another important figure. 2. The name commonly used for Kumbela (tib. ཀུན་འཕེལ་ལགས), the favorite of the 13th Dalai Lama who became politically powerful during the later period of the 13th Dalai Lama&#x27;s reign.">kujar</a> or what?   

**A:**  The regents didn't have kujar. They had the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. སྣེ་མགྲོན] The monk official in charge of the Regent&#x27;s Secretariat Office (shöga). He was the equivalent of the Lord Chamberlain in the Dalai Lama&#x27;s Secretariat.">nendrön</a>, and they also might have had attendants like <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. གསོལ་དཔོན] A lama or abbot&#x27;s servant.">söpön</a>, and they would report through them.   

**Q:**  I heard that when someone wanted to get a job, or get some paperwork done, or something for a law case, they had to go to the person's house and they didn't go to the office, is that correct?   

**A:**  They submitted the petition to the Kashag and they also went to the person's house. It would have been more difficult for the Tibetans because they had to go to four people's homes. In India, you only need to tell one person and he will just give the order, right? When people didn't get the chance to meet the officials in person, they had to go through the office.   

**Q:**  After you became the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. རྩེ་དྲུང] A monk official in the Tibetan government.">tsidrung</a>, when you met with your friends, what did they talk about? Did they talk about political things or did they just talk about ordinary things like chit chatting?   

**A:**  Tibetan people don't talk much about politics.   

**Q:**  The people working on politics will talk about politics, right?   

**A:**  At that time, we didn't have much to talk about.   

**Q:**  At that time, people talked a lot in the tea shops, right?   

**A:**  Yes, they would enjoy themselves and talk a lot.   

**Q:**  Wouldn't they have talked about things like someone was going to run away or that someone ran away, or something like that?   

**A:**  They wouldn't have talked like this.   

**Q:**  Wouldn't they talk about the candidates of the kalön saying, "Such and such persons are among the candidates. I heard that it was true"?   

**A:**  It could have been.
