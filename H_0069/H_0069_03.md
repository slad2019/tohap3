**Q:**  Did he go to submit the report?   

**A:**  Yes, he went to submit the report to the Kashag. At the end of the report, it was written that the report was submitted by some thoughtful [Tib. bsam yod] monk and lay officials. I heard that the Kashag scolded them for this.   

**Q:**  Was that after Trimön had left for Drepung?   

**A:**  I don't know about which happened first.   

**Q:**  I heard that when they went to submit the report, Trimön was not there. What they were planning to do was that if Trimön was in the Kashag, they were going to arrest him or kill him, was that correct? If this was not correct, at that time, people were saying that Lungshar's party was going to take power. Was that the way they were going to take power, or how were they going to grab him?   

**A:**  At that time, we just heard that they submitted the report and held the meeting, and it was said that the main person was Lungshar. After that, Lungshar was arrested. I didn't know what they had written in the report. Most people were saying that a letter was found when Lungshar's boots were searched, and that he also ate another letter. We didn't know the facts  

**Q:**  At that time, after five to six years, didn't people say that if Trimön hadn't gone to Drepung, that he would have been arrested, and that he was lucky? Otherwise, it would have been a disaster for him, right? What did people think later on? Did people say that if Lungshar was successful, things would have been better, or that if Lungshar didn't take power, it would have been worse?   

**A:**  I have never heard this. At that time, it was said that Lungshar was arrested and that there were many people in his party. But only about eight members, like Janglojen, were arrested. However, they didn't do anything to the other people.   

**Q:**  They were probably punished a little bit, right?   

**A:**  Yes, probably. I didn't hear anything about how Lungshar's party thought of reforming the system of government and those things.   

**Q:**  Afterwards, what did they say?   

**A:**  I knew many people who were in Lungshar's party. They should have told me something about that, but they didn't tell me anything, like saying that if they were successful, then they were going to do this.   

**Q:**  What did you think at that time? Did you think that if Lungshar was successful, there wouldn't be trouble between Taktra and Reting?   

**A:**  I didn't hear anything about this. I should have heard something because I knew many people, but I didn't hear anything.   

**Q:**  Usually, the people would talk about all things politics. Why would there have been nobody talking about that?   

**A:**  The Tibetan people didn't know much regarding how to think about politics. At that time, the majority of the people were saying, "Lungshar knew how to use black magic [Tib. snags rgyag] and how to do divinations with arrows, so he was able to curse people using black magic. Therefore, he put the letter in his boots and he ate [destroyed] another letter. This was to harm Trimön." I have never heard regrading the government side, "If Lungshar was successful, he would do this."   

**Q:**  When did the Panda’s event happen? Was it before the Lungshar event or after that?   

**A:**  It was probably one to two months after Lungshar.   

**Q:**  What is your reason for saying that it was after that?   

**A:**  Wait a minute. The Lungshar event took place in the 3-4th month. The news about the death of the Dalai Lama and Kujar's arrest had to reach Markham [Tib. smar khams].   

**Q:**  How long would it have taken for the news to reach over there?   

**A:**  It would have taken longer than one to two months.   

**Q:**  Would it have taken one month and 15 days?   

**A:**  It would have taken longer than that. It would have taken longer than a month to get to Chamdo, and then the news had to reach down there [Mankham]. Then the talk would have had to come up. So it would have taken time.   

**Q:**  Would it have taken about four to five months?   

**A:**  It would have taken three months at least.   

**Q:**  You don't remember the date and the season, like summer or winter?   

**A:**  No, I don't remember this well.   

**Q:**  How did you become a tsidrung (monk official)?   

**A:**  I was a son of ordinary people. In the beginning, after I finished my schooling, I was a layman. I became a tsidrung in the Yigtsang at the time of the Taktra.   

**Q:**  It was quite late during the time of the Taktra, right?   

**A:**  Yes.   

**Q:**  How old were you then?   

**A:**  I was about 24 years old.   

**Q:**  How did you decide to become a tsidrung? How did you get the idea?   

**A:**  At that time, there were two kinds of paths in our country: doing trading or serving the government. We went to school from the beginning and learned writing and reading, so I chose the path for becoming a tsidrung.   

**Q:**  Would people usually become government officials at this age? You were not quite late to become an official, right? Did you go to the Nepalese Gorkha School [Tib. gor kha'i slob grwa]?   

**A:**  Actually, that was not a Nepalese school. The Tibetan government set up a school for teaching Nepalese writing and I was in that school.   

**Q:**  At that time, did you become a tsidrung?   

**A:**  No, I didn't.   

**Q:**  Why did they set up the school for learning Nepalese writing? When did they set up the school?   

**A:**  This was for making relations with the Nepalese. Later, when we had to make relations with India, the English school was set up. It was similar to that.   

**Q:**  When did they set up the Nepalese school?   

**A:**  That was probably when I was 10 years old.   

**Q:**  Was that during Reting or Taktra?   

**A:**  No, it was at the time of the 13th Dalai Lama.   

**Q:**  Where did they set up the school?   

**A:**  It was set up in Lhasa.   

**Q:**  In which part of Lhasa?   

**A:**  It was set up in the house located near Sechung's [Tib. gsar byung] house.   

**Q:**  How many students were there?   

**A:**  There were 10 students.   

**Q:**  How and from where did they recruit the students?   

**A:**  The school was set up by the government and the appropriate ones joined the school. Mainly, when people sent their children to the school, both Tibetans and Nepalese were taught.   

**Q:**  Did the government spend the expenditures?   

**A:**  There weren't any expenditures. Wherever we went to school, the students would eat their own food and then went to school. The government probably paid something to the teacher.   

**Q:**  Was the teacher Nepalese?   

**A:**  No, he was a Tibetan. There was an old teacher who came from Darjeeling.   

**Q:**  Did he teach the Nepalese language and writing?   

**A:**  Yes.   

**Q:**  He didn't teach anything else, right?   

**A:**  He also taught math.   

**Q:**  How did you graduate from this school? Or was it stopped?   

**A:**  I don't know what the degree was that we needed to graduate. I studied there for a little over four years, learning Nepalese and Tibetan, and then we stopped going to the school and four of us were called to work in Trapchi complex for Kujar Künphel la.   

**Q:**  Who were the four students?   

**A:**  One was the late Tsendrön Drakpa Yügye [Tib. grags pa g.yul rgyal], and there was Sonam [Tib. bsod nams] and Keldan [Tib. skal ldan]. All of them have probably died.   

**Q:**  Were all of them the children of kudrak?   

**A:**  No, they weren't.   

**Q:**  How old were you when you finished the school?   

**A:**  I was probably 16-17 years old.   

**Q:**  Did you join Trapchi right after you finished at the school?   

**A:**  Not really joined, we were kind of called to work there.   

**Q:**  Did Kujar call you there?   

**A:**  Yes. In the beginning, there were four of us, and after that, all of the students were called there.   

**Q:**  All of the 10 students worked in Trapchi, right?   

**A:**  Yes, that's how I knew a little about Kujar.   

**Q:**  How old are you now?   

**A:**  Now, I am 62 years old.   

**Q:**  You were born in 1937, right?   

**A:**  Probably.   

**Q:**  That can't be because the Dalai Lama died in 1933. You were not 16-17 years old when you finished school. You must have been much younger then. I thought you were in your fifties.   

**A:**  No, I became a tsidrung at the right time.   

**Q:**  When you were called from the school to work in the Trapchi Office, could you have refused it?   

**A:**  Nobody had the thought to refuse it.   

**Q:**  All of you were glad to go, right?   

**A:**  Yes.   

**Q:**  After you came to Trapchi, you became a government official right away, right?   

**A:**  No, I became a tsidrung during the Taktra period.   

**Q:**  Actually, all the government staffs officers [Tib. gzhung gi las byed pa] were not government officials [Tib. gzhung zhabs], and all the staffs were not kungö, right?   

**A:**  It probably depended on whether people would call them kungö or not.   

**Q:**  I don't think so. What work did you do in the Trapchi Office?   

**A:**  At that time, the main work was hand copying letters. All of us could write Tibetan very well.   

**Q:**  Did they pay a salary from the government?   

**A:**  We were paid a little bit of barley and money as a salary.   

**Q:**  Could you live on that salary?   

**A:**  No, we couldn't, but we didn't think about that because we had our homes. It was like pocket money.   

**Q:**  How long did you work in the Trapchi Office?   

**A:**  Even after I became a tsidrung, I still worked in the Trapchi Office and I never worked in other work units.   

**Q:**  Was Tsarong Sawang in the Trapchi Office when you were there?   

**A:**  Yes, Tsarong was there from the beginning.   

**Q:**  Trekhang was also there, right?   

**A:**  In the beginning, he was there.   

**Q:**  When did they set up the Drongdrag Regiment?   

**A:**  That was in the Water-Monkey Year in 1932.   

**Q:**  Before that, there wasn't the Drongdrag, right?   

**A:**  Yes, I remember that clearly.   

**Q:**  Some people say that setting up the Drongdrag was the idea of Kujar. Do you think so?   

**A:**  It was probably the idea of the Dalai Lama because at that time, they were making war in Kham and they were sending a lot of ammunition to Kham.   

**Q:**  Why did they set up the Drongdrag instead of improving the Gusung Regiment?   

**A:**  The Gusung Regiment was for safeguarding the Dalai Lama and stayed in Lhasa. The other soldiers had to go make war.   

**Q:**  Why did they set up the Drongdrag instead of improving the Trapchi Regiment?   

**A:**  At that time, the Trapchi Regiment was not here. It had been many years since they had been sent to Kham.   

**Q:**  Did the other regiments go to Kham?   

**A:**  There were many regiments in Kham. There were disturbances in Kham and it was decided that the Yangtse River would be the border in 1932-33. Until then, they had been confronting one another all the time.   

**Q:**  That was the time when Trekhang Trunyichemmo went to negotiate that the Yangtse River would be the border, right?   

**A:**  Yes.   

**Q:**  Was the idea of setting up the Drongdrag to reinforce the soldiers who were making war in Kham, or did they have the idea long before that?   

**A:**  This must have been a new idea because the west side of our Trapchi Office was an empty space where the Drongdrag Regiment was built. This was a newly built regiment located just near the Trapchi Office.   

**Q:**  Before building this regiment, the Drongdrag was probably staying in Yamön [Ch. ya men], right?   

**A:**  They probably stayed in Yamön because they needed a place for the soldiers to stay.   

**Q:**  Not only did they stay there, but they also practiced drills over there. At that time, Yuthok Kandrön, Derge Sey, and about 25 soldiers, were trained in Gyantse Janglo [Tib. lcang lo], right? I heard that Drongdrag was there at this time, is that correct?   

**A:**  There were also some soldiers chosen from the Gusung Regiment of the Dalai Lama.   

**Q:**  Later, all of them went into the Drongdrag, right?   

**A:**  No, they didn't.   

**Q:**  Who didn't go?   

**A:**  The soldiers of the Gusung Regiment worked as teachers. After, they went back, and they went back to their own regiment. They didn't join the Drongdrag.   

**Q:**  They went back to the Gusung Regiment, right?   

**A:**  Yes, the soldiers of the Gusung Regiment were recruited from the military gang [Tib. dmag rkang] they held.   

**Q:**  Was Yuthok the depön when he was in Gyantse?   

**A:**  No, he was a Kandrön.   

**Q:**  Were the kudrak regarded as the well-to-do households [Tib. grong drag]?   

**A:**  As for the Drongdrag, I don't know what the standard was to be qualified as a well-to-do household from where the soldiers were recruited, like if they had to have 100 rupees or if they had to have more than 75.   

**Q:**  Were there soldiers recruited from the kudrak?   

**A:**  Yes, there were, like Ngabö Kalön and Derge Sey. There were several others also. They became soldiers before they became lay officials. After becoming lay officials, they didn't remain soldiers.   

**Q:**  Were most of the Drongdrag soldiers recruited from the taxpayer or treba class of villagers?   

**A:**  Yes, it was something like that.   

**Q:**  How did Ngabö and Derge Sey become soldiers in the Drongdrag? As for Ngabö, he was not allowed to become a lay official because Horkhang Sonam Pembar [Tib. bsod nams dpal 'bar] was there serving as the lay official of Horkhang. How did Derge Sey come into the Drongdrag?   

**A:**  Even if they were from a kudrak family and they were young, if they had already become a lay official, they were not recruited into the Drongdrag. The children of the kudrak who hadn't become lay officials were probably recruited into the Drongdrag.   

**Q:**  Were most of them recruited because they were treba and obliged to send a soldier, or did they join it voluntarily?   

**A:**  As I told you before, they should probably had a standard for what was a Drongdrag, a well-to-do household. Like if the household had 100 rupees, it would have been regarded as a well-to-do.   

**Q:**  They probably didn't have that standard. They must have recruited the soldiers from the households who were said to be well-to-do and who had some better children. The dzong might have recommended the well-to-do households under their jurisdiction, right?   

**Q:**  What were you thinking before you became a tsidrung?   

**Q:**  You had been working for many years in the Trapchi Office and then you got the idea of becoming a tsidrung. When you got the idea of becoming a tsidrung, did you have to use some expenditures or did you need a backer for that?   

**A:**  I was working in that office from the beginning, though I was not a tsidrung. So I submitted a report to the Yigtsang in which I wrote, "I have been working in the Trapchi Office during these past years and I would like to seek permission to become a tsidrung and to continue working in this office."   

**Q:**  Were you a monk at that time?   

**A:**  No, I wasn't. But I requested as a monk to become a tsidrung and the permission was granted.   

**Q:**  You got permission even though you were not a monk, right?   

**A:**  Yes, I would have had to become a monk.   

**Q:**  Did you have to report to the kungö in charge of the Trapchi Office that you were going to submit the report to the Yigtsang?   

**A:**  Yes, I had to.   

**Q:**  Did you have to submit the report through the Trapchi Office or you could just submit it directly to the Yigtsang?   

**A:**  I could submit it directly.   

**Q:**  At that time, if you didn't have a backer in the Yigtsang, it probably would have been difficult, right?   

**A:**  There were different kinds of situations.   

**Q:**  You probably had a little bit of a backer. Otherwise, everyone would submit a report to become a tsidrung. [Laughter] I think that was because you had been working there for many years.   

**A:**  Yes, it was because ever since I left the school from my childhood, I was working in the office.   

**Q:**  Did all the others become tsidrung?   

**A:**  Only two of us became tsidrung.   

**Q:**  The others didn't become tsidrung, right?   

**A:**  They didn't become officials, but they continued to work in the office.   

**Q:**  What did they do?   

**A:**  Some of them were working in the mint printing currency and some of them were doing other jobs.   

**Q:**  Did you have friends among the trunyichemmo?   

**A:**  I knew all of them.   

**Q:**  At that time, you knew about submitting the report to the Yigtsang and making a report to the Trapchi Office. But, as a new person, they wouldn't have known about these kinds of procedures. So who would have advised them to do these things? Would the relatives teach them to do that, or how did they do that?   

**A:**  Mainly, the elder relatives and friends would teach what kind of procedures we had to go through. But, since we were working in the office, we knew a lot of things.   

**Q:**  What were your other relatives doing?   

**A:**  I had two elder sisters at home.   

**Q:**  Where was your father from?   

**A:**  He was from Lo where there was the Lama Losempa [Tib. lo sems dpa'], and he worked as a chandzö for the Sempa Labrang. My mother belonged to Tengyeling [Tib. bstan rgyas gling] and I was born in Lhasa. Later, she came to Lhoka.   

**Q:**  What was your mother doing for Tengyeling?   

**A:**  She was from a family of an official [Tib. zhabs sdod pa] of Tengyeling.   

**Q:**  She was not among the households that used to belong to Tengyeling and later belonged to the government, Tenla Shungchö [Tib. bstan bla gzhung chod], and became shungyuba, right? Or, did she belong to the government before that? Or, did she become Tenla Shungchö after you became the government official?   

**A:**  Tenla Shungchö means Tengyeling misers who became shungyuba, and it happened before I was born.   

**Q:**  Oh! I see. The households that used to belong to Tengyeling and later belonged to the government were all called Tenla Shungchö and they were kind of shungyuba, right?   

**A:**  It was something like that.   

**Q:**  For example, Kapshö and Maya [Tib. rma bya] were also among the Tenla Shungchö. What did your father do in Lhasa?   

**A:**  He probably worked for Tengyeling.   

**Q:**  That was later on, right?   

**A:**  Yes.   

**Q:**  Did he work as a treasurer—dechang—or nyerpa or what?   

**A:**  He worked as the estate manager—shidö—for the Losempa before the estate was handed over to the government. The magji, Keltsül la [Tib. skal tshul lags], was the official who took over the estate.   

**Q:**  When the Yigtsang granted you permission to become a tsidrung, you became a monk right away then, right?   

**A:**  Yes, I became a monk in Drepung Monastery?   

**Q:**  What khamtsen?   

**A:**  In Gungru [Tib. gung ru].   

**Q:**  Then you entered the monk's order [Tib. chos zhugs], right?   

**A:**  Yes.   

**Q:**  The monks knew that you were going to become a tsidrung, right?   

**A:**  Yes.   

**Q:**  You didn't need to tell the monastery that you were going to become a tsidrung, right?   

**A:**  Yes.   

**Q:**  When you entered the monk's order and went to the teaching grove for one day, you could go to Lhasa on the next day, right?   

**A:**  Yes.   

**Q:**  Did you take the name of chöndze?   

**A:**  Yes.   

**Q:**  You had to seek an audience with the abbot and attend the assembly for one day, right?   

**A:**  Yes.   

**Q:**  You had to serve an "admissions tea" [Tib. zhugs ja] in the khamtsen, right? Did you have to serve one in the Tratsang? You might have offered alms too, right?   

**A:**  Yes.   

**Q:**  You didn't get a salary from the government, so how did you manage your expenses? Did you have an estate?   

**A:**  Yes, we had an estate.   

**Q:**  How did you get the estate?   

**A:**  We got it from the early times.   

**Q:**  You got the estate from the early times, right?   

**A:**  Yes.   

**Q:**  Was the estate good?   

**A:**  Yes.   

**Q:**  Did the estate previously belong to Tengyeling?   

**A:**  No, when my father was working for the Losempa Labrang, he probably got the estate. At that time, we didn't need to worry about food.   

**Q:**  In Tibet, there were poor people, but the well-to-do households would never worry about expenses. At that time, you were living in Lhasa, so who took care of the estate?   

**A:**  I had some relatives taking care of the estate.   

**Q:**  Did you share your livelihood with your relatives?   

**A:**  Yes, we were living together.   

**Q:**  Were your relatives from the same parents?   

**A:**  My relatives living in the estate were from the same parents.   

**Q:**  Were they estate managers?   

**A:**  Yes.   

**Q:**  Did the estate have miser working for it?   

**A:**  Yes.   

**Q:**  Did you have to pay something like taxes or a lease to the Sempa Labrang?   

**A:**  They probably had to pay a little bit of something like a lease, but probably not much because it was leased many years ago. But I don't know how much they had to pay.   

**Q:**  Did they send you necessities like rice, flour, and cooking oil regularly to Lhasa?   

**A:**  There was no rice, but they would send flour, tsamba, and cooking oil.   

**Q:**  They would also send you barley, right?   

**A:**  Yes.   

**Q:**  You also sold barley, right?   

**A:**  Yes.   

**Q:**  In the west, there are different subjects in school and people used to say, "You shouldn't study this subject because it is difficult to find a job. If you study this, it is very popular and it would be good." For example, as a tsidrung from a poor household, what method would they take to get a good position? Some of them might have been thinking that, "This is an appropriate position for me and I can't reach that position." Some of them were probably saying that they were going to try as much as they could to get up to the position of the Kalön Lama. While there wasn't any legal rule from the government, what did people think about getting a good position? Would they say, "You shouldn't go to this dzong because you won't succeed. You should go there and after that, you should go there."?   

**A:**  At that time, we didn't have things like studying arts and those things.   

**Q:**  Yes, there wasn't anything like that. But when the officials would go to the dzong and get positions, what was the path that would lead to those positions? Some officials might have been thinking, "It would be okay even I were to go to a dzong or estate far away." Some of them might have thought that "If I were to go a dzong that is a long distance away, I would not be able to stay in Lhasa," right?   

**A:**  Yes, each person would have had their own thoughts.   

**Q:**  Supposing a middle standard household had a good fortune, what would they have thought about things like getting positions? For example, lay officials had a different way of thinking. How did the tsidrung think about getting positions?   

**A:**  They didn't have a different way.   

**Q:**  Yes, there was a different way. For example, lay officials would think about getting positions like the mayorship [Tib. mi dpon], and then the shölpa [Tib. zhol pa], the head of the Shöl Leygung. Then the tsipön. They were trying to avoid going to the far away dzongs, right?   

**A:**  Yes, it depended on the capability of the person. Some people liked to work in Lhasa and some people didn't like to work in Lhasa, even if they were told to work and they liked to go to the dzong.   

**Q:**  When people didn't have much money, even if they wanted to stay in Lhasa, they would go to the dzong. Once they left for the dzong, they would have to stay there for four years. The rich people were working in Lhasa, like the kandrön.   

**A:**  There was talk about this. If a bigger household had a capable person, and if he got the position of kalön, they had to keep many servants and horses, and they need fodder to feed the horses. So the bigger kudrak would become kalön and those high positions. It was said that the kudrak who had small estates should go to the dzongs. Otherwise, if they could get a high position, everyone would try to get one.   

**Q:**  Among the lay officials, if someone was capable, they could get whatever kind of positions they wanted. But, among the tsidrung, could only the bigger monks' households take the higher positions, or what?   

**A:**  For example, the Gyanbungang Jigyab Khembo, Ngawang Namgyal [Tib. ngag dbang rnam rgyal], used to be servant of a household.   

**Q:**  There were just one or two people like this, but usually, what about the majority of the tsidrung?   

**A:**  The tsidrung didn't need to do so many troublesome and elaborate things. Even the trunyichemmo only had one riding servant.   

**Q:**  If someone became a kalön lama, did they also only have one servant?   

**A:**  They had the same amount of servants as the kalön.   

**Q:**  For example, normally, among the lay officials, if someone wanted to get to a high position, first, they would try to become a kandrön or kadrung, or the Secretary of Tsikhang, Tsipa. Then they would try to get the position of tsipön and then kalön if possible. There could have been a similar thing among the tsidrung also—like becoming the Secretary, Yigtsang Nyerpa [Tib. yig tshang gnyer pa], was considered the best way—which was equal to kandrön and kadrung.   

**A:**  Yes, if they were capable. Like the kandrön and kadrung, there were some new tsidrung working in the Yigtsang as the staff of Yigtsang [Tib. las bya].   

**Q:**  From where did they select the candidates for trunyichemmo?   

**A:**  The Yigtsang would select the candidates.   

**Q:**  I mean from where did they select the candidates? They wouldn't have selected them from the ordinary tsidrung, right? They would have excluded the khenche [Tib. mkhan che]. Would they have selected them from the tsendrön?   

**A:**  They could have.   

**Q:**  They would have selected them from among the khenjung, the tsendrön, and the shöndrön, right?   

**A:**  They would also have selected from among the ordinary tsidrung. There were some ordinary tsidrung selected as candidates for trunyichemmo. But mostly, they were selected from among the khenjung and tsendrön.   

**Q:**  There could have been one to two tsidrung specifically appointed by the Dalai Lama or the regent. We want to ask you something about the ranks. Who was the highest tsidrung?   

**A:**  It was the jigyab khembo.   

**Q:**  Was there a term of years for the jigyab khembo?   

**A:** 

  

**Q:**  Who was the next?   

**A:**  It was the khenche.   

**Q:**  Was the dzasa higher than the khenche?   

**A:**  Yes.   

**Q:**  The khenche were in the Nangma, right? I mean, was it called Nangmakhang?   

**A:**  Yes, Nangma means the officials sitting in the Dalai Lama's assembly hall/meeting place [Tib. gzim chung]. They were called Nangma, and outside of that it was the gag, and the tsendrön would sit in the gag.   

**Q:**  Both the khenche and khenjung sat inside, right?   

**A:**  Yes.   

**Q:**  Sometimes, the assembly hall couldn't hold all of the khenjung and some of them had to sit outside, right?   

**A:**  No, there wasn't any talk about holding or not holding all of them in the hall.   

**Q:**  So all the khenjung would sit inside the assembly hall, they didn't need to sit outside, right?   

**A:**  Yes.   

**Q:**  This was not the office, right?   

**A:**  Yes.   

**Q:**  Did the khenche have jobs?   

**A:**  Some of them had jobs.   

**Q:**  What kind of jobs did they have?   

**A:**  They got jobs like ones in the auditor's office [Tib. zhib khang].   

**Q:**  What was underneath khenche?   

**A:**  There were a lot of khenjung.   

**Q:**  The khenjung were the fourth rank, right?   

**A:**  It was kind of strange. From where did they count the rimshi? I don't know where it started and what the other three ranks were.   

**Q:**  What was the second rank?   

**A:**  I don't know.   

**Q:**  The kalön were the third rank, right?   

**A:**  Yes, supposing the Dalai Lama is regarded as the first rank.   

**Q:**  Did they count the Dalai Lama in the ranks?   

**A:**  I think probably not.   

**Q:**  Anyway, all the khenjung were of the fourth rank. There were offices like the Yigtsang, Tse ga, Shöga, the Shöl Printing House [Tib. zhol par khang], and the office for performing additional rituals, Shabphar Khang [Tib. zhabs 'phar khang], where the tsidrung exclusively worked, right?   

**A:**  There were some offices where it was not exclusively tsidrung.   

**Q:**  Was it the office for performing rituals [Tib. zhabs brtan las khungs]?   

**A:**  Yes.   

**Q:**  And there was the Dalai Lama's kitchen [Tib. rtse gsol thab]?   

**A:**  Yes.   

**Q:**  Then I have the drönyerchemmo and the nendrön.   

**A:**  When there was the regent and the prime minister, then there was the nendrön.   

**Q:**  What was the job of the nendrön?   

**A:**  All of the petitions submitted to the regent should go through the nendrön.   

**Q:**  For example, if the Yigtsang had to submit a report, then they should hand it over to the nendrön, right?   

**A:**  Except the kalön of the Kashag and the trunyichemmo of Yigtsang who would submit the report directly to the regent in person, all the other reports should have been submitted through the nendrön. If the Kashag and the Yigtsang were to send their staffs to submit a report, then it should have been submitted through the nendrön.   

**Q:**  Supposing I am a kalön, if I have to go see the Dalai Lama or the Regent in person, can I go directly or how can I walk in?   

**A:**  They would have had to report beforehand that they wanted to see the Dalai Lama through either the drönyerchemmo or through the nendrön when there was a regent—if the Kashag had to go to see them.   

**Q:**  How about if it was a single person?
