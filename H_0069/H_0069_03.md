**Q:**  Did he go to submit the report?   

**A:**  Yes, he went to submit the report to the Kashag. At the end of the report, it was written that the report was submitted by some thoughtful [Tib. བསམ་ཡོད] monk and lay officials. I heard that the Kashag scolded them for this.   

**Q:**  Was that after <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཁྲི་སྨོན] The name of the aristocratic family of an important lay official .">Trimön</a> had left for Drepung?   

**A:**  I don't know about which happened first.   

**Q:**  I heard that when they went to submit the report, <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཁྲི་སྨོན] The name of the aristocratic family of an important lay official .">Trimön</a> was not there. What they were planning to do was that if Trimön was in the Kashag, they were going to arrest him or kill him, was that correct? If this was not correct, at that time, people were saying that <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ལུང་ཤར] The family name of a famous aristocratic lay official during the time of the 13th Dalai Lama and the Regent Reting.">Lungshar</a>'s party was going to take power. Was that the way they were going to take power, or how were they going to grab him?   

**A:**  At that time, we just heard that they submitted the report and held the meeting, and it was said that the main person was <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ལུང་ཤར] The family name of a famous aristocratic lay official during the time of the 13th Dalai Lama and the Regent Reting.">Lungshar</a>. After that, Lungshar was arrested. I didn't know what they had written in the report. Most people were saying that a letter was found when Lungshar's boots were searched, and that he also ate another letter. We didn't know the facts  

**Q:**  At that time, after five to six years, didn't people say that if <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཁྲི་སྨོན] The name of the aristocratic family of an important lay official .">Trimön</a> hadn't gone to Drepung, that he would have been arrested, and that he was lucky? Otherwise, it would have been a disaster for him, right? What did people think later on? Did people say that if <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ལུང་ཤར] The family name of a famous aristocratic lay official during the time of the 13th Dalai Lama and the Regent Reting.">Lungshar</a> was successful, things would have been better, or that if Lungshar didn't take power, it would have been worse?   

**A:**  I have never heard this. At that time, it was said that <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ལུང་ཤར] The family name of a famous aristocratic lay official during the time of the 13th Dalai Lama and the Regent Reting.">Lungshar</a> was arrested and that there were many people in his party. But only about eight members, like Janglojen, were arrested. However, they didn't do anything to the other people.   

**Q:**  They were probably punished a little bit, right?   

**A:**  Yes, probably. I didn't hear anything about how <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ལུང་ཤར] The family name of a famous aristocratic lay official during the time of the 13th Dalai Lama and the Regent Reting.">Lungshar</a>'s party thought of reforming the system of government and those things.   

**Q:**  Afterwards, what did they say?   

**A:**  I knew many people who were in <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ལུང་ཤར] The family name of a famous aristocratic lay official during the time of the 13th Dalai Lama and the Regent Reting.">Lungshar</a>'s party. They should have told me something about that, but they didn't tell me anything, like saying that if they were successful, then they were going to do this.   

**Q:**  What did you think at that time? Did you think that if <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ལུང་ཤར] The family name of a famous aristocratic lay official during the time of the 13th Dalai Lama and the Regent Reting.">Lungshar</a> was successful, there wouldn't be trouble between <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. སྟག་བྲག] The regent of Tibet who replaced Reting in 1941 and served until 1950 when the 14th Dalai Lama assumed power.">Taktra</a> and Reting?   

**A:**  I didn't hear anything about this. I should have heard something because I knew many people, but I didn't hear anything.   

**Q:**  Usually, the people would talk about all things politics. Why would there have been nobody talking about that?   

**A:**  The Tibetan people didn't know much regarding how to think about politics. At that time, the majority of the people were saying, "<a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ལུང་ཤར] The family name of a famous aristocratic lay official during the time of the 13th Dalai Lama and the Regent Reting.">Lungshar</a> knew how to use black magic [Tib. སྣགས་རྒྱག] and how to do divinations with arrows, so he was able to curse people using black magic. Therefore, he put the letter in his boots and he ate [destroyed] another letter. This was to harm Trimön." I have never heard regrading the government side, "If Lungshar was successful, he would do this."   

**Q:**  When did the Panda’s event happen? Was it before the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ལུང་ཤར] The family name of a famous aristocratic lay official during the time of the 13th Dalai Lama and the Regent Reting.">Lungshar</a> event or after that?   

**A:**  It was probably one to two months after Lungshar.   

**Q:**  What is your reason for saying that it was after that?   

**A:**  Wait a minute. The <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ལུང་ཤར] The family name of a famous aristocratic lay official during the time of the 13th Dalai Lama and the Regent Reting.">Lungshar</a> event took place in the 3-4th month. The news about the death of the Dalai Lama and Kujar's arrest had to reach Markham [Tib. སྨར་ཁམས].   

**Q:**  How long would it have taken for the news to reach over there?   

**A:**  It would have taken longer than one to two months.   

**Q:**  Would it have taken one month and 15 days?   

**A:**  It would have taken longer than that. It would have taken longer than a month to get to Chamdo, and then the news had to reach down there [Mankham]. Then the talk would have had to come up. So it would have taken time.   

**Q:**  Would it have taken about four to five months?   

**A:**  It would have taken three months at least.   

**Q:**  You don't remember the date and the season, like summer or winter?   

**A:**  No, I don't remember this well.   

**Q:**  How did you become a <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. རྩེ་དྲུང] A monk official in the Tibetan government.">tsidrung</a> (monk official)?   

**A:**  I was a son of ordinary people. In the beginning, after I finished my schooling, I was a layman. I became a <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. རྩེ་དྲུང] A monk official in the Tibetan government.">tsidrung</a> in the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཡིག་ཚང] The highest office dealing with monastic and religious affairs in the traditional Tibetan government. It is often called the Ecclesiastic Office. It was headed by 4 fourth rank monk officials called Trunyichemmo. The senior Trunyichemmo was called Ta Lama.">Yigtsang</a> at the time of the Taktra.   

**Q:**  It was quite late during the time of the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. སྟག་བྲག] The regent of Tibet who replaced Reting in 1941 and served until 1950 when the 14th Dalai Lama assumed power.">Taktra</a>, right?   

**A:**  Yes.   

**Q:**  How old were you then?   

**A:**  I was about 24 years old.   

**Q:**  How did you decide to become a <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. རྩེ་དྲུང] A monk official in the Tibetan government.">tsidrung</a>? How did you get the idea?   

**A:**  At that time, there were two kinds of paths in our country: doing trading or serving the government. We went to school from the beginning and learned writing and reading, so I chose the path for becoming a tsidrung.   

**Q:**  Would people usually become government officials at this age? You were not quite late to become an official, right? Did you go to the Nepalese Gorkha School [Tib. གོར་ཁའི་སློབ་གྲྭ]?   

**A:**  Actually, that was not a Nepalese school. The Tibetan government set up a school for teaching Nepalese writing and I was in that school.   

**Q:**  At that time, did you become a <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. རྩེ་དྲུང] A monk official in the Tibetan government.">tsidrung</a>?   

**A:**  No, I didn't.   

**Q:**  Why did they set up the school for learning Nepalese writing? When did they set up the school?   

**A:**  This was for making relations with the Nepalese. Later, when we had to make relations with India, the English school was set up. It was similar to that.   

**Q:**  When did they set up the Nepalese school?   

**A:**  That was probably when I was 10 years old.   

**Q:**  Was that during Reting or <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. སྟག་བྲག] The regent of Tibet who replaced Reting in 1941 and served until 1950 when the 14th Dalai Lama assumed power.">Taktra</a>?   

**A:**  No, it was at the time of the 13th Dalai Lama.   

**Q:**  Where did they set up the school?   

**A:**  It was set up in Lhasa.   

**Q:**  In which part of Lhasa?   

**A:**  It was set up in the house located near Sechung's [Tib. གསར་བྱུང] house.   

**Q:**  How many students were there?   

**A:**  There were 10 students.   

**Q:**  How and from where did they recruit the students?   

**A:**  The school was set up by the government and the appropriate ones joined the school. Mainly, when people sent their children to the school, both Tibetans and Nepalese were taught.   

**Q:**  Did the government spend the expenditures?   

**A:**  There weren't any expenditures. Wherever we went to school, the students would eat their own food and then went to school. The government probably paid something to the teacher.   

**Q:**  Was the teacher Nepalese?   

**A:**  No, he was a Tibetan. There was an old teacher who came from Darjeeling.   

**Q:**  Did he teach the Nepalese language and writing?   

**A:**  Yes.   

**Q:**  He didn't teach anything else, right?   

**A:**  He also taught math.   

**Q:**  How did you graduate from this school? Or was it stopped?   

**A:**  I don't know what the degree was that we needed to graduate. I studied there for a little over four years, learning Nepalese and Tibetan, and then we stopped going to the school and four of us were called to work in <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. གྲྭ་བཞི] 1. An area below Sera Monastery. 2. The location of the Tibetan Armory-Mint Office and the regimental headquarters of the Khadang Regiment, which was also called the Trapchi Regiment.">Trapchi</a> complex for Kujar <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཀུན་འཕེལ] The name of the favorite of the 13th Dalai Lama who became politically powerful during the later period of the 13th Dalai Lama&#x27;s reign.">Künphel</a> la.   

**Q:**  Who were the four students?   

**A:**  One was the late <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. རྩེ་མགྲོན] The monk officials working as aides in the Tse ga, the Secretariat of the Dalai Lama.">Tsendrön</a> Drakpa Yügye [Tib. གྲགས་པ་གཡུལ་རྒྱལ], and there was Sonam [Tib. བསོད་ནམས] and Keldan [Tib. སྐལ་ལྡན]. All of them have probably died.   

**Q:**  Were all of them the children of <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. སྐུ་དྲག] 1. A member of the lay aristocracy. 2. Title for government lay and monk officials. 3. A name occasionally used for the top leaders/officials in a monastery.">kudrak</a>?   

**A:**  No, they weren't.   

**Q:**  How old were you when you finished the school?   

**A:**  I was probably 16-17 years old.   

**Q:**  Did you join <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. གྲྭ་བཞི] 1. An area below Sera Monastery. 2. The location of the Tibetan Armory-Mint Office and the regimental headquarters of the Khadang Regiment, which was also called the Trapchi Regiment.">Trapchi</a> right after you finished at the school?   

**A:**  Not really joined, we were kind of called to work there.   

**Q:**  Did Kujar call you there?   

**A:**  Yes. In the beginning, there were four of us, and after that, all of the students were called there.   

**Q:**  All of the 10 students worked in <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. གྲྭ་བཞི] 1. An area below Sera Monastery. 2. The location of the Tibetan Armory-Mint Office and the regimental headquarters of the Khadang Regiment, which was also called the Trapchi Regiment.">Trapchi</a>, right?   

**A:**  Yes, that's how I knew a little about Kujar.   

**Q:**  How old are you now?   

**A:**  Now, I am 62 years old.   

**Q:**  You were born in 1937, right?   

**A:**  Probably.   

**Q:**  That can't be because the Dalai Lama died in 1933. You were not 16-17 years old when you finished school. You must have been much younger then. I thought you were in your fifties.   

**A:**  No, I became a <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. རྩེ་དྲུང] A monk official in the Tibetan government.">tsidrung</a> at the right time.   

**Q:**  When you were called from the school to work in the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. གྲྭ་བཞི] 1. An area below Sera Monastery. 2. The location of the Tibetan Armory-Mint Office and the regimental headquarters of the Khadang Regiment, which was also called the Trapchi Regiment.">Trapchi</a> Office, could you have refused it?   

**A:**  Nobody had the thought to refuse it.   

**Q:**  All of you were glad to go, right?   

**A:**  Yes.   

**Q:**  After you came to <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. གྲྭ་བཞི] 1. An area below Sera Monastery. 2. The location of the Tibetan Armory-Mint Office and the regimental headquarters of the Khadang Regiment, which was also called the Trapchi Regiment.">Trapchi</a>, you became a government official right away, right?   

**A:**  No, I became a <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. རྩེ་དྲུང] A monk official in the Tibetan government.">tsidrung</a> during the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. སྟག་བྲག] The regent of Tibet who replaced Reting in 1941 and served until 1950 when the 14th Dalai Lama assumed power.">Taktra</a> period.   

**Q:**  Actually, all the government staffs officers [Tib. གཞུང་གི་ལས་བྱེད་པ] were not government officials [Tib. གཞུང་ཞབས], and all the staffs were not <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. སྐུ་ངོ] An honorific term of address for aristocratic officials. It is something like, &quot;Your Excellency.&quot;">kungö</a>, right?   

**A:**  It probably depended on whether people would call them <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. སྐུ་ངོ] An honorific term of address for aristocratic officials. It is something like, &quot;Your Excellency.&quot;">kungö</a> or not.   

**Q:**  I don't think so. What work did you do in the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. གྲྭ་བཞི] 1. An area below Sera Monastery. 2. The location of the Tibetan Armory-Mint Office and the regimental headquarters of the Khadang Regiment, which was also called the Trapchi Regiment.">Trapchi</a> Office?   

**A:**  At that time, the main work was hand copying letters. All of us could write Tibetan very well.   

**Q:**  Did they pay a salary from the government?   

**A:**  We were paid a little bit of barley and money as a salary.   

**Q:**  Could you live on that salary?   

**A:**  No, we couldn't, but we didn't think about that because we had our homes. It was like pocket money.   

**Q:**  How long did you work in the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. གྲྭ་བཞི] 1. An area below Sera Monastery. 2. The location of the Tibetan Armory-Mint Office and the regimental headquarters of the Khadang Regiment, which was also called the Trapchi Regiment.">Trapchi</a> Office?   

**A:**  Even after I became a <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. རྩེ་དྲུང] A monk official in the Tibetan government.">tsidrung</a>, I still worked in the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. གྲྭ་བཞི] 1. An area below Sera Monastery. 2. The location of the Tibetan Armory-Mint Office and the regimental headquarters of the Khadang Regiment, which was also called the Trapchi Regiment.">Trapchi</a> Office and I never worked in other work units.   

**Q:**  Was Tsarong <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ས་དབང] One of the heads of the Kashag [bka&#x27; shag] or Council of Ministers. Sawang was also a term of address for a Kalön/Shape.">Sawang</a> in the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. གྲྭ་བཞི] 1. An area below Sera Monastery. 2. The location of the Tibetan Armory-Mint Office and the regimental headquarters of the Khadang Regiment, which was also called the Trapchi Regiment.">Trapchi</a> Office when you were there?   

**A:**  Yes, Tsarong was there from the beginning.   

**Q:**  Trekhang was also there, right?   

**A:**  In the beginning, he was there.   

**Q:**  When did they set up the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. གྲོང་དྲག] The army regiment created during the 13th Dalai Lama&#x27;s reign whose members were recruited from better families. The name &quot;Drongdrag&quot; means &quot;better families.&quot;">Drongdrag</a> Regiment?   

**A:**  That was in the Water-Monkey Year in 1932.   

**Q:**  Before that, there wasn't the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. གྲོང་དྲག] The army regiment created during the 13th Dalai Lama&#x27;s reign whose members were recruited from better families. The name &quot;Drongdrag&quot; means &quot;better families.&quot;">Drongdrag</a>, right?   

**A:**  Yes, I remember that clearly.   

**Q:**  Some people say that setting up the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. གྲོང་དྲག] The army regiment created during the 13th Dalai Lama&#x27;s reign whose members were recruited from better families. The name &quot;Drongdrag&quot; means &quot;better families.&quot;">Drongdrag</a> was the idea of Kujar. Do you think so?   

**A:**  It was probably the idea of the Dalai Lama because at that time, they were making war in Kham and they were sending a lot of ammunition to Kham.   

**Q:**  Why did they set up the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. གྲོང་དྲག] The army regiment created during the 13th Dalai Lama&#x27;s reign whose members were recruited from better families. The name &quot;Drongdrag&quot; means &quot;better families.&quot;">Drongdrag</a> instead of improving the Gusung Regiment?   

**A:**  The Gusung Regiment was for safeguarding the Dalai Lama and stayed in Lhasa. The other soldiers had to go make war.   

**Q:**  Why did they set up the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. གྲོང་དྲག] The army regiment created during the 13th Dalai Lama&#x27;s reign whose members were recruited from better families. The name &quot;Drongdrag&quot; means &quot;better families.&quot;">Drongdrag</a> instead of improving the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. གྲྭ་བཞི] 1. An area below Sera Monastery. 2. The location of the Tibetan Armory-Mint Office and the regimental headquarters of the Khadang Regiment, which was also called the Trapchi Regiment.">Trapchi</a> Regiment?   

**A:**  At that time, the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. གྲྭ་བཞི] 1. An area below Sera Monastery. 2. The location of the Tibetan Armory-Mint Office and the regimental headquarters of the Khadang Regiment, which was also called the Trapchi Regiment.">Trapchi</a> Regiment was not here. It had been many years since they had been sent to Kham.   

**Q:**  Did the other regiments go to Kham?   

**A:**  There were many regiments in Kham. There were disturbances in Kham and it was decided that the Yangtse River would be the border in 1932-33. Until then, they had been confronting one another all the time.   

**Q:**  That was the time when Trekhang <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. དྲུང་ཡིག་ཆེན་མོ] The title of the four heads of the Yigtsang office (Ecclesiastic Office).">Trunyichemmo</a> went to negotiate that the Yangtse River would be the border, right?   

**A:**  Yes.   

**Q:**  Was the idea of setting up the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. གྲོང་དྲག] The army regiment created during the 13th Dalai Lama&#x27;s reign whose members were recruited from better families. The name &quot;Drongdrag&quot; means &quot;better families.&quot;">Drongdrag</a> to reinforce the soldiers who were making war in Kham, or did they have the idea long before that?   

**A:**  This must have been a new idea because the west side of our <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. གྲྭ་བཞི] 1. An area below Sera Monastery. 2. The location of the Tibetan Armory-Mint Office and the regimental headquarters of the Khadang Regiment, which was also called the Trapchi Regiment.">Trapchi</a> Office was an empty space where the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. གྲོང་དྲག] The army regiment created during the 13th Dalai Lama&#x27;s reign whose members were recruited from better families. The name &quot;Drongdrag&quot; means &quot;better families.&quot;">Drongdrag</a> Regiment was built. This was a newly built regiment located just near the Trapchi Office.   

**Q:**  Before building this regiment, the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. གྲོང་དྲག] The army regiment created during the 13th Dalai Lama&#x27;s reign whose members were recruited from better families. The name &quot;Drongdrag&quot; means &quot;better families.&quot;">Drongdrag</a> was probably staying in Yamön [Ch. ya men], right?   

**A:**  They probably stayed in Yamön because they needed a place for the soldiers to stay.   

**Q:**  Not only did they stay there, but they also practiced drills over there. At that time, Yuthok Kandrön, Derge Sey, and about 25 soldiers, were trained in Gyantse Janglo [Tib. ལྕང་ལོ], right? I heard that <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. གྲོང་དྲག] The army regiment created during the 13th Dalai Lama&#x27;s reign whose members were recruited from better families. The name &quot;Drongdrag&quot; means &quot;better families.&quot;">Drongdrag</a> was there at this time, is that correct?   

**A:**  There were also some soldiers chosen from the Gusung Regiment of the Dalai Lama.   

**Q:**  Later, all of them went into the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. གྲོང་དྲག] The army regiment created during the 13th Dalai Lama&#x27;s reign whose members were recruited from better families. The name &quot;Drongdrag&quot; means &quot;better families.&quot;">Drongdrag</a>, right?   

**A:**  No, they didn't.   

**Q:**  Who didn't go?   

**A:**  The soldiers of the Gusung Regiment worked as teachers. After, they went back, and they went back to their own regiment. They didn't join the Drongdrag.   

**Q:**  They went back to the Gusung Regiment, right?   

**A:**  Yes, the soldiers of the Gusung Regiment were recruited from the military <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. རྐང] The basic land measurement unit for tax obligations in the traditional Tibetan society. One gang was considered a full tax unit of land. A gang was measured by volume, specifically by the amount of seed (sönkhe) that could be sown. This amount was not standardized and the size of one gang varied under different lords.">gang</a> [Tib. དམག་རྐང] they held.   

**Q:**  Was Yuthok the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. མདའ་དཔོན] A commander or general in charge of a regiment in the traditional Tibetan Army. If a regiment had only 500 troops, there was usually only one depön, but if there were 1,000 troops, there were usually two.">depön</a> when he was in Gyantse?   

**A:**  No, he was a Kandrön.   

**Q:**  Were the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. སྐུ་དྲག] 1. A member of the lay aristocracy. 2. Title for government lay and monk officials. 3. A name occasionally used for the top leaders/officials in a monastery.">kudrak</a> regarded as the well-to-do households [Tib. གྲོང་དྲག]?   

**A:**  As for the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. གྲོང་དྲག] The army regiment created during the 13th Dalai Lama&#x27;s reign whose members were recruited from better families. The name &quot;Drongdrag&quot; means &quot;better families.&quot;">Drongdrag</a>, I don't know what the standard was to be qualified as a well-to-do household from where the soldiers were recruited, like if they had to have 100 rupees or if they had to have more than 75.   

**Q:**  Were there soldiers recruited from the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. སྐུ་དྲག] 1. A member of the lay aristocracy. 2. Title for government lay and monk officials. 3. A name occasionally used for the top leaders/officials in a monastery.">kudrak</a>?   

**A:**  Yes, there were, like Ngabö <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. བཀའ་བློན] One of the heads of the Kashag [bka&#x27; shag] or Council of Ministers. There were usually 4 Kalön, although in the 1950s the number increased at various times to 6 or 7. The Kalön ministers made decisions collectively, and had no fixed term of office.">Kalön</a> and Derge Sey. There were several others also. They became soldiers before they became lay officials. After becoming lay officials, they didn't remain soldiers.   

**Q:**  Were most of the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. གྲོང་དྲག] The army regiment created during the 13th Dalai Lama&#x27;s reign whose members were recruited from better families. The name &quot;Drongdrag&quot; means &quot;better families.&quot;">Drongdrag</a> soldiers recruited from the taxpayer or <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཁྲལ་པ] The class of bound peasant/miser/serf households who held farmland and had to fulfill large corvée tax obligations to their manorial estates/lords. They are often called taxpayer households in English. While some of these were well off by local standards, many were poor due to a variety of factors such as heavy debts and a dearth of able-bodied workers in their households.">treba</a> class of villagers?   

**A:**  Yes, it was something like that.   

**Q:**  How did Ngabö and Derge Sey become soldiers in the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. གྲོང་དྲག] The army regiment created during the 13th Dalai Lama&#x27;s reign whose members were recruited from better families. The name &quot;Drongdrag&quot; means &quot;better families.&quot;">Drongdrag</a>? As for Ngabö, he was not allowed to become a lay official because Horkhang Sonam Pembar [Tib. བསོད་ནམས་དཔལ་འབར] was there serving as the lay official of Horkhang. How did Derge Sey come into the Drongdrag?   

**A:**  Even if they were from a <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. སྐུ་དྲག] 1. A member of the lay aristocracy. 2. Title for government lay and monk officials. 3. A name occasionally used for the top leaders/officials in a monastery.">kudrak</a> family and they were young, if they had already become a lay official, they were not recruited into the Drongdrag. The children of the kudrak who hadn't become lay officials were probably recruited into the Drongdrag.   

**Q:**  Were most of them recruited because they were <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཁྲལ་པ] The class of bound peasant/miser/serf households who held farmland and had to fulfill large corvée tax obligations to their manorial estates/lords. They are often called taxpayer households in English. While some of these were well off by local standards, many were poor due to a variety of factors such as heavy debts and a dearth of able-bodied workers in their households.">treba</a> and obliged to send a soldier, or did they join it voluntarily?   

**A:**  As I told you before, they should probably had a standard for what was a <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. གྲོང་དྲག] The army regiment created during the 13th Dalai Lama&#x27;s reign whose members were recruited from better families. The name &quot;Drongdrag&quot; means &quot;better families.&quot;">Drongdrag</a>, a well-to-do household. Like if the household had 100 rupees, it would have been regarded as a well-to-do.   

**Q:**  They probably didn't have that standard. They must have recruited the soldiers from the households who were said to be well-to-do and who had some better children. The <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. རྫོང] A district in the traditional Tibetan governmental structure. This large administrative unit was headed by one or two district heads (tib. dzongpön [རྫོང་དཔོན]) appointed by the Tibetan government. Typically there was one lay official and one monk official who were jointly sent from Lhasa for three year terms. They were responsible for collecting taxes and adjudicating disputes in their district. These dzong were equivalent to counties (ch. 县) in the current Chinese system of administration.">dzong</a> might have recommended the well-to-do households under their jurisdiction, right?   

**Q:**  What were you thinking before you became a <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. རྩེ་དྲུང] A monk official in the Tibetan government.">tsidrung</a>?   

**Q:**  You had been working for many years in the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. གྲྭ་བཞི] 1. An area below Sera Monastery. 2. The location of the Tibetan Armory-Mint Office and the regimental headquarters of the Khadang Regiment, which was also called the Trapchi Regiment.">Trapchi</a> Office and then you got the idea of becoming a <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. རྩེ་དྲུང] A monk official in the Tibetan government.">tsidrung</a>. When you got the idea of becoming a tsidrung, did you have to use some expenditures or did you need a backer for that?   

**A:**  I was working in that office from the beginning, though I was not a <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. རྩེ་དྲུང] A monk official in the Tibetan government.">tsidrung</a>. So I submitted a report to the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཡིག་ཚང] The highest office dealing with monastic and religious affairs in the traditional Tibetan government. It is often called the Ecclesiastic Office. It was headed by 4 fourth rank monk officials called Trunyichemmo. The senior Trunyichemmo was called Ta Lama.">Yigtsang</a> in which I wrote, "I have been working in the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. གྲྭ་བཞི] 1. An area below Sera Monastery. 2. The location of the Tibetan Armory-Mint Office and the regimental headquarters of the Khadang Regiment, which was also called the Trapchi Regiment.">Trapchi</a> Office during these past years and I would like to seek permission to become a tsidrung and to continue working in this office."   

**Q:**  Were you a monk at that time?   

**A:**  No, I wasn't. But I requested as a monk to become a <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. རྩེ་དྲུང] A monk official in the Tibetan government.">tsidrung</a> and the permission was granted.   

**Q:**  You got permission even though you were not a monk, right?   

**A:**  Yes, I would have had to become a monk.   

**Q:**  Did you have to report to the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. སྐུ་ངོ] An honorific term of address for aristocratic officials. It is something like, &quot;Your Excellency.&quot;">kungö</a> in charge of the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. གྲྭ་བཞི] 1. An area below Sera Monastery. 2.

**A:**  Yes, I had to.   

**Q:**  Did you have to submit the report through the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. གྲྭ་བཞི] 1. An area below Sera Monastery. 2. The location of the Tibetan Armory-Mint Office and the regimental headquarters of the Khadang Regiment, which was also called the Trapchi Regiment.">Trapchi</a> Office or you could just submit it directly to the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཡིག་ཚང] The highest office dealing with monastic and religious affairs in the traditional Tibetan government.

**A:**  I could submit it directly.   

**Q:**  At that time, if you didn't have a backer in the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཡིག་ཚང] The highest office dealing with monastic and religious affairs in the traditional Tibetan government. It is often called the Ecclesiastic Office. It was headed by 4 fourth rank monk officials called Trunyichemmo. The senior Trunyichemmo was called Ta Lama.">Yigtsang</a>, it probably would have been difficult, right?   

**A:**  There were different kinds of situations.   

**Q:**  You probably had a little bit of a backer. Otherwise, everyone would submit a report to become a tsidrung. [Laughter] I think that was because you had been working there for many years.   

**A:**  Yes, it was because ever since I left the school from my childhood, I was working in the office.   

**Q:**  Did all the others become <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. རྩེ་དྲུང] A monk official in the Tibetan government.">tsidrung</a>?   

**A:**  Only two of us became tsidrung.   

**Q:**  The others didn't become <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. རྩེ་དྲུང] A monk official in the Tibetan government.">tsidrung</a>, right?   

**A:**  They didn't become officials, but they continued to work in the office.   

**Q:**  What did they do?   

**A:**  Some of them were working in the mint printing currency and some of them were doing other jobs.   

**Q:**  Did you have friends among the trunyichemmo?   

**A:**  I knew all of them.   

**Q:**  At that time, you knew about submitting the report to the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཡིག་ཚང] The highest office dealing with monastic and religious affairs in the traditional Tibetan government. It is often called the Ecclesiastic Office. It was headed by 4 fourth rank monk officials called Trunyichemmo.

The location of the Tibetan Armory-Mint Office and the regimental headquarters of the Khadang Regiment, which was also called the Trapchi Regiment.">Trapchi</a> Office. But, as a new person, they wouldn't have known about these kinds of procedures. So who would have advised them to do these things? Would the relatives teach them to do that, or how did they do that?   

**A:**  Mainly, the elder relatives and friends would teach what kind of procedures we had to go through. But, since we were working in the office, we knew a lot of things.   

**Q:**  What were your other relatives doing?   

**A:**  I had two elder sisters at home.   

**Q:**  Where was your father from?   

**A:**  He was from Lo where there was the Lama Losempa [Tib. ལོ་སེམས་དཔའ], and he worked as a <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཕྱག་མཛོད] A senior manager/treasurer of an aristocratic or monastic estate, or the senior manager/treasurer of an aristocratic family or a monastic unit. Generally chandzö handled both internal and external issues and were considered higher in power and status than nyerpa (stewards), who typically only handled the storerooms.">chandzö</a> for the Sempa Labrang. My mother belonged to Tengyeling [Tib. བསྟན་རྒྱས་གླིང] and I was born in Lhasa. Later, she came to Lhoka.   

**Q:**  What was your mother doing for Tengyeling?   

**A:**  She was from a family of an official [Tib. ཞབས་སྡོད་པ] of Tengyeling.   

**Q:**  She was not among the households that used to belong to Tengyeling and later belonged to the government, Tenla Shungchö [Tib. བསྟན་བླ་གཞུང་ཆོད], and became <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. གཞུང་རྒྱུགས་པ] A type of bound peasant/miser/serf whose lord was the government rather than an aristocrat or monastery/lama. They usually had sizable land holdings and were primarily responsible for providing the corvée transport and riding animal tax for the Tibetan government&#x27;s transportation system. Often translated as, &quot;Government taxpayer serfs.&quot;">shungyuba</a>, right? Or, did she belong to the government before that? Or, did she become Tenla Shungchö after you became the government official?   

**A:**  Tenla Shungchö means Tengyeling misers who became <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. གཞུང་རྒྱུགས་པ] A type of bound peasant/miser/serf whose lord was the government rather than an aristocrat or monastery/lama. They usually had sizable land holdings and were primarily responsible for providing the corvée transport and riding animal tax for the Tibetan government&#x27;s transportation system. Often translated as, &quot;Government taxpayer serfs.&quot;">shungyuba</a>, and it happened before I was born.   

**Q:**  Oh! I see. The households that used to belong to Tengyeling and later belonged to the government were all called Tenla Shungchö and they were kind of <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. གཞུང་རྒྱུགས་པ] A type of bound peasant/miser/serf whose lord was the government rather than an aristocrat or monastery/lama. They usually had sizable land holdings and were primarily responsible for providing the corvée transport and riding animal tax for the Tibetan government&#x27;s transportation system. Often translated as, &quot;Government taxpayer serfs.&quot;">shungyuba</a>, right?   

**A:**  It was something like that.   

**Q:**  For example, Kapshö and Maya [Tib. རྨ་བྱ] were also among the Tenla Shungchö. What did your father do in Lhasa?   

**A:**  He probably worked for Tengyeling.   

**Q:**  That was later on, right?   

**A:**  Yes.   

**Q:**  Did he work as a treasurer—dechang—or <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. གཉེར་པ] A steward or manager. In some monasteries, the nyerpa was in charge of storerooms under the authority of a higher manager called a chandzö.">nyerpa</a> or what?   

**A:**  He worked as the estate manager—shidö—for the Losempa before the estate was handed over to the government. The <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. དམག་སྤྱི] 1. Commander-in-Chief (of the Tibetan Army). 2. Commander of a regiment in Chushigandru.">magji</a>, Keltsül la [Tib. སྐལ་ཚུལ་ལགས], was the official who took over the estate.

The senior Trunyichemmo was called Ta Lama.">Yigtsang</a> granted you permission to become a <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. རྩེ་དྲུང] A monk official in the Tibetan government.">tsidrung</a>, you became a monk right away then, right?   

**A:**  Yes, I became a monk in Drepung Monastery?   

**Q:**  What <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཁང་ཚན] A monastic residential unit in which monks from specific geographic areas lived. These were corporate entities with property and internal officials. Some large khamtsen had smaller subordinate units called mi tshan. Khamtsen were part of tratsang (colleges). For example, Hamdong Khamtsen was part of Gomang College in Drepung Monastery.">khamtsen</a>?   

**A:**  In Gungru [Tib. གུང་རུ].   

**Q:**  Then you entered the monk's order [Tib. ཆོས་ཞུགས], right?   

**A:**  Yes.   

**Q:**  The monks knew that you were going to become a <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. རྩེ་དྲུང] A monk official in the Tibetan government.">tsidrung</a>, right?   

**A:**  Yes.   

**Q:**  You didn't need to tell the monastery that you were going to become a <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. རྩེ་དྲུང] A monk official in the Tibetan government.">tsidrung</a>, right?   

**A:**  Yes.   

**Q:**  When you entered the monk's order and went to the teaching grove for one day, you could go to Lhasa on the next day, right?   

**A:**  Yes.   

**Q:**  Did you take the name of <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཆོས་མཛད] The title of monks who made a payment or gave gifts to secure exemption from the normal &quot;young monk&quot; work obligations. There were tratsang chöndze and khamtsen chöndze.">chöndze</a>?

**A:**  Yes.   

**Q:**  You didn't get a salary from the government, so how did you manage your expenses? Did you have an estate?   

**A:**  Yes, we had an estate.   

**Q:**  How did you get the estate?   

**A:**  We got it from the early times.   

**Q:**  You got the estate from the early times, right?   

**A:**  Yes.   

**Q:**  Was the estate good?   

**A:**  Yes.   

**Q:**  Did the estate previously belong to Tengyeling?   

**A:**  No, when my father was working for the Losempa Labrang, he probably got the estate. At that time, we didn't need to worry about food.   

**Q:**  In Tibet, there were poor people, but the well-to-do households would never worry about expenses. At that time, you were living in Lhasa, so who took care of the estate?   

**A:**  I had some relatives taking care of the estate.   

**Q:**  Did you share your livelihood with your relatives?   

**A:**  Yes, we were living together.   

**Q:**  Were your relatives from the same parents?   

**A:**  My relatives living in the estate were from the same parents.   

**Q:**  Were they estate managers?   

**A:**  Yes.   

**Q:**  Did the estate have <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. མི་སེར] A term that can mean serf/bound subject as well as citizen, depending on context. For example, the miser of a lord would connote the bound subjects of that lord, whereas the miser of Tibet would connote citizens of Tibet.">miser</a> working for it?   

**A:**  Yes.   

**Q:**  Did you have to pay something like taxes or a lease to the Sempa Labrang?   

**A:**  They probably had to pay a little bit of something like a lease, but probably not much because it was leased many years ago. But I don't know how much they had to pay.   

**Q:**  Did they send you necessities like rice, flour, and cooking oil regularly to Lhasa?   

**A:**  There was no rice, but they would send flour, <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. རྩམ་པ] The traditional Tibetan staple food that consists of grain that is roasted (popped), usually in heated sand, and then ground into a flour.">tsamba</a>, and cooking oil.   

**Q:**  They would also send you barley, right?   

**A:**  Yes.   

**Q:**  You also sold barley, right?   

**A:**  Yes.   

**Q:**  In the west, there are different subjects in school and people used to say, "You shouldn't study this subject because it is difficult to find a job. If you study this, it is very popular and it would be good." For example, as a <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. རྩེ་དྲུང] A monk official in the Tibetan government.">tsidrung</a> from a poor household, what method would they take to get a good position? Some of them might have been thinking that, "This is an appropriate position for me and I can't reach that position." Some of them were probably saying that they were going to try as much as they could to get up to the position of the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. བཀའ་བློན] One of the heads of the Kashag [bka&#x27; shag] or Council of Ministers. There were usually 4 Kalön, although in the 1950s the number increased at various times to 6 or 7. The Kalön ministers made decisions collectively, and had no fixed term of office.">Kalön</a> Lama. While there wasn't any legal rule from the government, what did people think about getting a good position? Would they say, "You shouldn't go to this <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. རྫོང] A district in the traditional Tibetan governmental structure. This large administrative unit was headed by one or two district heads (tib. dzongpön [རྫོང་དཔོན]) appointed by the Tibetan government. Typically there was one lay official and one monk official who were jointly sent from Lhasa for three year terms. They were responsible for collecting taxes and adjudicating disputes in their district. These dzong were equivalent to counties (ch. 县) in the current Chinese system of administration.">dzong</a> because you won't succeed. You should go there and after that, you should go there."?   

**A:**  At that time, we didn't have things like studying arts and those things.   

**Q:**  Yes, there wasn't anything like that. But when the officials would go to the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. རྫོང] A district in the traditional Tibetan governmental structure. This large administrative unit was headed by one or two district heads (tib. dzongpön [རྫོང་དཔོན]) appointed by the Tibetan government.

They were responsible for collecting taxes and adjudicating disputes in their district. These dzong were equivalent to counties (ch. 县) in the current Chinese system of administration.">dzong</a> and get positions, what was the path that would lead to those positions? Some officials might have been thinking, "It would be okay even I were to go to a dzong or estate far away." Some of them might have thought that "If I were to go a dzong that is a long distance away, I would not be able to stay in Lhasa," right?   

**A:**  Yes, each person would have had their own thoughts.   

**Q:**  Supposing a middle standard household had a good fortune, what would they have thought about things like getting positions? For example, lay officials had a different way of thinking. How did the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. རྩེ་དྲུང] A monk official in the Tibetan government.">tsidrung</a> think about getting positions?   

**A:**  They didn't have a different way.   

**Q:**  Yes, there was a different way. For example, lay officials would think about getting positions like the mayorship [Tib. མི་དཔོན], and then the shölpa [Tib. ཞོལ་པ], the head of the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཞོལ] The walled town beneath the Potala Palace in Lhasa.">Shöl</a> Leygung. Then the tsipön. They were trying to avoid going to the far away dzongs, right?   

**A:**  Yes, it depended on the capability of the person. Some people liked to work in Lhasa and some people didn't like to work in Lhasa, even if they were told to work and they liked to go to the dzong.   

**Q:**  When people didn't have much money, even if they wanted to stay in Lhasa, they would go to the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. རྫོང] A district in the traditional Tibetan governmental structure. This large administrative unit was headed by one or two district heads (tib. dzongpön [རྫོང་དཔོན]) appointed by the Tibetan government. Typically there was one lay official and one monk official who were jointly sent from Lhasa for three year terms. They were responsible for collecting taxes and adjudicating disputes in their district. These dzong were equivalent to counties (ch. 县) in the current Chinese system of administration.">dzong</a>. Once they left for the dzong, they would have to stay there for four years. The rich people were working in Lhasa, like the kandrön.   

**A:**  There was talk about this. If a bigger household had a capable person, and if he got the position of kalön, they had to keep many servants and horses, and they need fodder to feed the horses. So the bigger <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. སྐུ་དྲག] 1. A member of the lay aristocracy. 2. Title for government lay and monk officials. 3. A name occasionally used for the top leaders/officials in a monastery.">kudrak</a> would become kalön and those high positions. It was said that the kudrak who had small estates should go to the dzongs. Otherwise, if they could get a high position, everyone would try to get one.   

**Q:**  Among the lay officials, if someone was capable, they could get whatever kind of positions they wanted. But, among the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. རྩེ་དྲུང] A monk official in the Tibetan government.">tsidrung</a>, could only the bigger monks' households take the higher positions, or what?   

**A:**  For example, the Gyanbungang Jigyab Khembo, Ngawang <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. རྣམ་རྒྱལ] 1. A person&#x27;s name. 2. The name of the Dalai Lama&#x27;s monastery located in the Potala Palace [tib. rnam rgyal grwa tshamg].">Namgyal</a> [Tib. ངག་དབང་རྣམ་རྒྱལ], used to be servant of a household.   

**Q:**  There were just one or two people like this, but usually, what about the majority of the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. རྩེ་དྲུང] A monk official in the Tibetan government.">tsidrung</a>?   

**A:**  The <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. རྩེ་དྲུང] A monk official in the Tibetan government.">tsidrung</a> didn't need to do so many troublesome and elaborate things. Even the trunyichemmo only had one riding servant.   

**Q:**  If someone became a kalön lama, did they also only have one servant?   

**A:**  They had the same amount of servants as the kalön.   

**Q:**  For example, normally, among the lay officials, if someone wanted to get to a high position, first, they would try to become a <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. བཀའ་མགྲོན] Administrative aide to the Kashag. There were usually two or three of these, all of whom were aristocratic lay officials.">kandrön</a> or <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. བཀའ་དྲུང] Aide/secretary to the Kashag. There were usually two of these, both aristocratic lay officials. Their job was to assist the Kalöns, and their usual work involved writing whatever letters, documents, orders, and recommendations the Kashag sent to the Dalai Lama and other offices. Their office was called the Dröndrungkhang [tib. མགྲོན་དྲུང་ཁང].">kadrung</a>, or the Secretary of Tsikhang, Tsipa. Then they would try to get the position of tsipön and then kalön if possible. There could have been a similar thing among the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. རྩེ་དྲུང] A monk official in the Tibetan government.">tsidrung</a> also—like becoming the Secretary, <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཡིག་ཚང] The highest office dealing with monastic and religious affairs in the traditional Tibetan government. It is often called the Ecclesiastic Office. It was headed by 4 fourth rank monk officials called Trunyichemmo. The senior Trunyichemmo was called Ta Lama.">Yigtsang</a> Nyerpa [Tib. ཡིག་ཚང་གཉེར་པ], was considered the best way—which was equal to kandrön and kadrung.   

**A:**  Yes, if they were capable. Like the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. བཀའ་མགྲོན] Administrative aide to the Kashag. There were usually two or three of these, all of whom were aristocratic lay officials.">kandrön</a> and <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. བཀའ་དྲུང] Aide/secretary to the Kashag.

**Q:**  From where did they select the candidates for trunyichemmo?   

**A:**  The <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཡིག་ཚང] The highest office dealing with monastic and religious affairs in the traditional Tibetan government. It is often called the Ecclesiastic Office. It was headed by 4 fourth rank monk officials called Trunyichemmo. The senior Trunyichemmo was called Ta Lama.">Yigtsang</a> would select the candidates.   

**Q:**  I mean from where did they select the candidates? They wouldn't have selected them from the ordinary <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. རྩེ་དྲུང] A monk official in the Tibetan government.">tsidrung</a>, right? They would have excluded the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. མཁན་ཆེ] A high monk official of the third rank in the traditional Tibetan government.">khenche</a> [Tib. མཁན་ཆེ]. Would they have selected them from the tsendrön?   

**A:**  They could have.   

**Q:**  They would have selected them from among the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. མཁན་ཆུང] A rank/title for monk officials that was equal to 4th rank (tib. རིམ་བཞི) officials in the lay aristocratic side of the traditional government bureaucracy.">khenjung</a>, the tsendrön, and the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཤོད་མགྲོན] Monk officials working in the Secretariat of the Regent. They were something like an aide-de-camp.">shöndrön</a>, right?   

**A:**  They would also have selected from among the ordinary <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. རྩེ་དྲུང] A monk official in the Tibetan government.">tsidrung</a>. There were some ordinary tsidrung selected as candidates for trunyichemmo. But mostly, they were selected from among the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. མཁན་ཆུང] A rank/title for monk officials that was equal to 4th rank (tib. རིམ་བཞི) officials in the lay aristocratic side of the traditional government bureaucracy.">khenjung</a> and tsendrön.   

**Q:**  There could have been one to two <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. རྩེ་དྲུང] A monk official in the Tibetan government.">tsidrung</a> specifically appointed by the Dalai Lama or the regent. We want to ask you something about the ranks. Who was the highest tsidrung?   

**A:**  It was the jigyab khembo.   

**Q:**  Was there a term of years for the jigyab <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. མཁན་པོ] Abbot of a monastery or monastic college.">khembo</a>?   

**A:**    

**Q:**  Who was the next?   

**A:**  It was the khenche.   

**Q:**  Was the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. རྫ་ས] 1. A high rank in the Tibetan government. 2. A top manager-like official for the labrang of important incarnate lamas, especially those who in the past had served as regents of Tibet.">dzasa</a> higher than the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. མཁན་ཆེ] A high monk official of the third rank in the traditional Tibetan government.">khenche</a>?   

**A:**  Yes.   

**Q:**  The <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. མཁན་ཆེ] A high monk official of the third rank in the traditional Tibetan government.">khenche</a> were in the Nangma, right? I mean, was it called Nangmakhang?   

**A:**  Yes, Nangma means the officials sitting in the Dalai Lama's assembly hall/meeting place [Tib. གཟིམ་ཆུང]. They were called Nangma, and outside of that it was the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. འགག] The Secretariat Office of either the Dalai Lama (tib. ཙེ་གག [རྩེ་འགག]) or the Regent (tib. shö gag [ཞོལ་འགག]).">gag</a>, and the tsendrön would sit in the gag.   

**Q:**  Both the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. མཁན་ཆེ] A high monk official of the third rank in the traditional Tibetan government.">khenche</a> and <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. མཁན་ཆུང] A rank/title for monk officials that was equal to 4th rank (tib. རིམ་བཞི) officials in the lay aristocratic side of the traditional government bureaucracy.">khenjung</a> sat inside, right?   

**A:**  Yes.   

**Q:**  Sometimes, the assembly hall couldn't hold all of the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. མཁན་ཆུང] A rank/title for monk officials that was equal to 4th rank (tib. རིམ་བཞི) officials in the lay aristocratic side of the traditional government bureaucracy.">khenjung</a> and some of them had to sit outside, right?   

**A:**  No, there wasn't any talk about holding or not holding all of them in the hall.   

**Q:**  So all the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. མཁན་ཆུང] A rank/title for monk officials that was equal to 4th rank (tib. རིམ་བཞི) officials in the lay aristocratic side of the traditional government bureaucracy.">khenjung</a> would sit inside the assembly hall, they didn't need to sit outside, right?   

**A:**  Yes.   

**Q:**  This was not the office, right?   

**A:**  Yes.   

**Q:**  Did the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. མཁན་ཆེ] A high monk official of the third rank in the traditional Tibetan government.">khenche</a> have jobs?   

**A:**  Some of them had jobs.   

**Q:**  What kind of jobs did they have?   

**A:**  They got jobs like ones in the auditor's office [Tib. ཞིབ་ཁང].   

**Q:**  What was underneath <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. མཁན་ཆེ] A high monk official of the third rank in the traditional Tibetan government.">khenche</a>?   

**A:**  There were a lot of khenjung.   

**Q:**  The <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. མཁན་ཆུང] A rank/title for monk officials that was equal to 4th rank (tib. རིམ་བཞི) officials in the lay aristocratic side of the traditional government bureaucracy.">khenjung</a> were the fourth rank, right?   

**A:**  It was kind of strange. From where did they count the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. རིམ་བཞི] A fourth rank official in the Tibetan government.">rimshi</a>? I don't know where it started and what the other three ranks were.   

**Q:**  What was the second rank?   

**A:**  I don't know.   

**Q:**  The kalön were the third rank, right?   

**A:**  Yes, supposing the Dalai Lama is regarded as the first rank.   

**Q:**  Did they count the Dalai Lama in the ranks?   

**A:**  I think probably not.   

**Q:**  Anyway, all the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. མཁན་ཆུང] A rank/title for monk officials that was equal to 4th rank (tib. རིམ་བཞི) officials in the lay aristocratic side of the traditional government bureaucracy.">khenjung</a> were of the fourth rank. There were offices like the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཡིག་ཚང] The highest office dealing with monastic and religious affairs in the traditional Tibetan government. It is often called the Ecclesiastic Office. It was headed by 4 fourth rank monk officials called Trunyichemmo. The senior Trunyichemmo was called Ta Lama.">Yigtsang</a>, <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. རྩེ] The Potala Palace.">Tse</a> ga, Shöga, the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཞོལ] The walled town beneath the Potala Palace in Lhasa.">Shöl</a> Printing House [Tib. ཞོལ་པར་ཁང], and the office for performing additional rituals, Shabphar Khang [Tib. ཞབས་འཕར་ཁང], where the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. རྩེ་དྲུང] A monk official in the Tibetan government.">tsidrung</a> exclusively worked, right?   

**A:**  There were some offices where it was not exclusively tsidrung.   

**Q:**  Was it the office for performing rituals [Tib. ཞབས་བརྟན་ལས་ཁུངས]?   

**A:**  Yes.   

**Q:**  And there was the Dalai Lama's kitchen [Tib. རྩེ་གསོལ་ཐབ]?   

**A:**  Yes.   

**Q:**  Then I have the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. མགྲོན་གཉེར་ཆེན་མོ] 1. The Dalai Lama&#x27;s Lord Chamberlain. He was one of the most important monk officials in the Tibetan government and was the head of the Tse ga, the Dalai Lama&#x27;s secretariat. 2. A high economic managerial position in some large monasteries.">drönyerchemmo</a> and the nendrön.   

**A:**  When there was the regent and the prime minister, then there was the nendrön.   

**Q:**  What was the job of the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. སྣེ་མགྲོན] The monk official in charge of the Regent&#x27;s Secretariat Office (shöga). He was the equivalent of the Lord Chamberlain in the Dalai Lama&#x27;s Secretariat.">nendrön</a>?   

**A:**  All of the petitions submitted to the regent should go through the nendrön.   

**Q:**  For example, if the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཡིག་ཚང] The highest office dealing with monastic and religious affairs in the traditional Tibetan government. It is often called the Ecclesiastic Office. It was headed by 4 fourth rank monk officials called Trunyichemmo. The senior Trunyichemmo was called Ta Lama.">Yigtsang</a> had to submit a report, then they should hand it over to the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. སྣེ་མགྲོན] The monk official in charge of the Regent&#x27;s Secretariat Office (shöga). He was the equivalent of the Lord Chamberlain in the Dalai Lama&#x27;s Secretariat.">nendrön</a>, right?   

**A:**  Except the kalön of the Kashag and the trunyichemmo of <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཡིག་ཚང] The highest office dealing with monastic and religious affairs in the traditional Tibetan government. It is often called the Ecclesiastic Office. It was headed by 4 fourth rank monk officials called Trunyichemmo. The senior Trunyichemmo was called Ta Lama.">Yigtsang</a> who would submit the report directly to the regent in person, all the other reports should have been submitted through the nendrön. If the Kashag and the Yigtsang were to send their staffs to submit a report, then it should have been submitted through the nendrön.   

**Q:**  Supposing I am a kalön, if I have to go see the Dalai Lama or the Regent in person, can I go directly or how can I walk in?   

**A:**  They would have had to report beforehand that they wanted to see the Dalai Lama through either the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. མགྲོན་གཉེར་ཆེན་མོ] 1. The Dalai Lama&#x27;s Lord Chamberlain. He was one of the most important monk officials in the Tibetan government and was the head of the Tse ga, the Dalai Lama&#x27;s secretariat. 2.

He was the equivalent of the Lord Chamberlain in the Dalai Lama&#x27;s Secretariat.">nendrön</a> when there was a regent—if the Kashag had to go to see them.   

**Q:**  How about if it was a single person?
