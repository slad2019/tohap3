**A:**  If it would have been a personal matter, they were not allowed to go in. If it was an important official matter, they would go together to see the Dalai Lama or the Regent.   

**Q:**  In America, people would go to an office and say that they wanted to see whoever it was, like the president. And they would ask him whether he was busy or not, and if he was not busy, they would let us see him. Was it possible to do that in Tibet when the people wanted to see the Dalai Lama or the Regent?   

**A:**  I never heard about people trying to do that.   

**Q:**  Did they have to send a letter saying that they would like to come?   

**A:**  They didn't need to send a letter, they just had to report it to the officials in the Gag.   

**Q:**  The <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. སྣེ་མགྲོན] The monk official in charge of the Regent&#x27;s Secretariat Office (shöga). He was the equivalent of the Lord Chamberlain in the Dalai Lama&#x27;s Secretariat.">nendrön</a> would go to the regent directly, right?   

**A:**  Probably.   

**Q:**  If the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. མགྲོན་གཉེར་ཆེན་མོ] 1. The Dalai Lama&#x27;s Lord Chamberlain. He was one of the most important monk officials in the Tibetan government and was the head of the Tse ga, the Dalai Lama&#x27;s secretariat. 2. A high economic managerial position in some large monasteries.">drönyerchemmo</a> would go to the Dalai Lama directly, how could it have been that everyone blamed Kujar for not reporting the illness of the Dalai Lama instead of blaming the drönyerchemmo, the jigyab <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. མཁན་པོ] Abbot of a monastery or monastic college.">khembo</a> and the kalön. They would have known that the Dalai Lama was sick, right? Why was Kujar punished and those people didn't get punished?   

**A:**  Yes, they knew what happened. It is impossible that they didn't know that because they were in Norbulinga.   

**Q:**  That was just an attack against Kujar, right?   

**A:**  Yes.   

**Q:**  Would everyone have known, or just the tsidrung—like did the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. མགྲོན་གཉེར་ཆེན་མོ] 1. The Dalai Lama&#x27;s Lord Chamberlain. He was one of the most important monk officials in the Tibetan government and was the head of the Tse ga, the Dalai Lama&#x27;s secretariat. 2. A high economic managerial position in some large monasteries.">drönyerchemmo</a> and the jigyab <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. མཁན་པོ] Abbot of a monastery or monastic college.">khembo</a> know about that? The Prime Minister [Tib. སྲིད་བློན] and the kalön probably didn't receive the message and they didn't know about that because they were not in <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ནོར་བུ་གླིང་ཁ] The summer palace of the Dalai Lama.">Norbulinga</a>, right?   

**A:**  For example, nowadays—someone wrote that the Dalai Lama didn't attend the Death Anniversary of Tsongkhapa, thevNgamjö. He might have said that he was sick.   

**Q:**  He might have just said that he was not going to attend the anniversary ceremony, and no one would have asked for the reason, right? Before the Dalai Lama attended the anniversary, would the people in <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ནོར་བུ་གླིང་ཁ] The summer palace of the Dalai Lama.">Norbulinga</a>, like the jigyab <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. མཁན་པོ] Abbot of a monastery or monastic college.">khembo</a>, have known that he got a cold?   

**A:**  They probably would have known and there would have been a kalön on duty whose turn it was to stay in <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ནོར་བུ་གླིང་ཁ] The summer palace of the Dalai Lama.">Norbulinga</a> [Tib. བཞུགས་ཆ]. They would have known that.   

**Q:**  How would the kalön have known? Who would have told them because they were not in the Dalai Lama's room?   

**A:**  I don't think this was something to be kept secret. Why would they have kept it secret? They didn't think of keeping it secret.   

**Q:**  Later, <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཀུན་འཕེལ] The name of the favorite of the 13th Dalai Lama who became politically powerful during the later period of the 13th Dalai Lama&#x27;s reign.">Künphel</a> la said that it was the Dalai Lama's order not to report it. Were there any other offices where only the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. རྩེ་དྲུང] A monk official in the Tibetan government.">tsidrung</a> would attend?   

**A:**  There were the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. བླ་ཕྱག] 1. The abbreviation of bla brang phyag mdzod, a major treasury/supply office that was located on the second floor of the Tsuglagang Temple and collected taxes annually from various parts of Tibet. 2. A monastic official/manager who worked for the Labrang of the abbots or incarnate lamas. For example, in Loseling College in Drepung, the Laja worked for the abbot who appointed him.">Laja</a> and the Tseja.   

**Q:**  There were lay officials in those offices. I mean, were there offices where the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. རྩེ་དྲུང] A monk official in the Tibetan government.">tsidrung</a> exclusively attended? I have some names of lower offices. What was next to the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. མཁན་ཆུང] A rank/title for monk officials that was equal to 4th rank (tib. རིམ་བཞི) officials in the lay aristocratic side of the traditional government bureaucracy.">khenjung</a>?   

**A:**  Next to the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. མཁན་ཆུང] A rank/title for monk officials that was equal to 4th rank (tib. རིམ་བཞི) officials in the lay aristocratic side of the traditional government bureaucracy.">khenjung</a> was the tsendrön.   

**Q:**  Were they equal to the fifth rank? I also know the treasury in the Potala, <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. རྩེ] The Potala Palace.">Tse</a> Nyertsang Leygung [Tib. རྩེ་གཉེར་ཚང་ལས་ཁུངས].   

**A:**  Only the fifth rank <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. རྩེ་དྲུང] A monk official in the Tibetan government.">tsidrung</a> who were not tsendrön were there in that office.   

**Q:**  Were tsendrön higher than fifth rank officials?   

**A:**  <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. རྩེ་མགྲོན] The monk officials working as aides in the Tse ga, the Secretariat of the Dalai Lama.">Tsendrön</a> were part of the fifth rank. There were a lot of other things within the fifth rank.   

**Q:**  <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. རྩེ་མགྲོན] The monk officials working as aides in the Tse ga, the Secretariat of the Dalai Lama.">Tsendrön</a> was not a rank, right?   

**A:**  Right, it was a position.   

**Q:**  If you asked the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. རྩེ་དྲུང] A monk official in the Tibetan government.">tsidrung</a> about their rank, would they say that "I am a fourth rank [official]," <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. རིམ་བཞི] A fourth rank official in the Tibetan government.">rimshi</a>?   

**A:**  Rimshi was for the lay officials.   

**Q:**  Would the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. རྩེ་དྲུང] A monk official in the Tibetan government.">tsidrung</a> say that they were fifth rank officials?   

**A:**  No, they wouldn't.   

**Q:**  What would they say?   

**A:**  They would say, "I am a tsendrön and a <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ལས་ཚན་པ] The name for officials of the 5th rank in the traditional Tibetan government.">letsenpa</a>." Among the letsenpa, there were also the fifth, the sixth and the seventh rank officials. Some of the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. རྩེ་དྲུང] A monk official in the Tibetan government.">tsidrung</a> were ordinary tsidrung, but they were of the fifth rank and they were going to the dzong.   

**Q:**  Was it only among the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. རྩེ་དྲུང] A monk official in the Tibetan government.">tsidrung</a>?   

**A:**  No, there were both.   

**Q:**  For example, among the lay officials, there were the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ལས་ཚན་པ] The name for officials of the 5th rank in the traditional Tibetan government.">letsenpa</a> and those people. What would they call the fifth, sixth and seventh rank officials in the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. རྩེ་དྲུང] A monk official in the Tibetan government.">tsidrung</a>?   

**A:**  The fifth and sixth ranks were called <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ལས་ཚན་པ] The name for officials of the 5th rank in the traditional Tibetan government.">letsenpa</a>, and there were also fifth and sixth ranks who were not letsenpa.   

**Q:**  The tsendrön were not <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ལས་ཚན་པ] The name for officials of the 5th rank in the traditional Tibetan government.">letsenpa</a>, but they were of the fifth rank, right?   

**A:**  Yes, there were also fifth rank officials who were not tsendrön. There were some dzong—like Gyantse Dzong, which was called the fifth rank, togne ngapa [Tib. ཏོག་གནས་ང་པ]—but they were not letsenpa. So if someone just became a fifth rank official, it was not certain that they would become a letsenpa.   

**Q:**  When you first started off as an ordinary <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. རྩེ་དྲུང] A monk official in the Tibetan government.">tsidrung</a>, what rank would you have gotten?   

**A:**  The ordinary <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. རྩེ་དྲུང] A monk official in the Tibetan government.">tsidrung</a> [Tib. དཀྱུས་མ] didn't have any rank [Tib. རིམ་པ]. They just had the togne [Tib. ཏོག་གནས].   

**Q:**  They would not call them seventh rank [Tib. རིམ་པ], right?   

**A:**  Yes, it was just called the rank togne.   

**Q:**  Tell us about how the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. རྩེ་དྲུང] A monk official in the Tibetan government.">tsidrung</a> would get the togne.   

**A:**  The lay officials and <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. རྩེ་དྲུང] A monk official in the Tibetan government.">tsidrung</a> were the same.   

**Q:**  What kind of togne did they have for positions like the official in charge of firewood [Tib. ཤིང་གཉེར] and the official in charge of the workers [Tib. བཟོ་ཁང་དོ་དམ་པ]?   

**A:**  The official in charge of firewood was probably the seventh rank <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ལས་ཚན་པ] The name for officials of the 5th rank in the traditional Tibetan government.">letsenpa</a> [Tib. རིམ་པ་བདུན་པའི་ལས་ཚན་པ].   

**Q:**  Was this the lowest rank among the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. རྩེ་དྲུང] A monk official in the Tibetan government.">tsidrung</a>? What was the lowest?   

**A:**  It was the ordinary <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. རྩེ་དྲུང] A monk official in the Tibetan government.">tsidrung</a> [Tib. དཀྱུས་མ].   

**Q:**  Did the ordinary <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. རྩེ་དྲུང] A monk official in the Tibetan government.">tsidrung</a> have togne?   

**A:**  Yes.   

**Q:**  What togne [did] they have?   

**A:**  They had the togne from the fifth to the seventh among the ordinary tsidrung.   

**Q:**  How did you differentiate these three?   

**A:**  In the beginning, the ordinary <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. རྩེ་དྲུང] A monk official in the Tibetan government.">tsidrung</a> just had a togne and it was called the empty rank [Tib. ཏོག་སྟོང]. Then they could ask for the togne, like the sixth togne, though they didn't have a position in the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. རྫོང] A district in the traditional Tibetan governmental structure. This large administrative unit was headed by one or two district heads (tib. dzongpön [རྫོང་དཔོན]) appointed by the Tibetan government. Typically there was one lay official and one monk official who were jointly sent from Lhasa for three year terms. They were responsible for collecting taxes and adjudicating disputes in their district. These dzong were equivalent to counties (ch. 县) in the current Chinese system of administration.">dzong</a>. If they could get the sixth togne, then it would have been easy to get the fifth togne. And it would have been easy to get a position in the dzong with the fifth togne.   

**Q:**  How could they have gotten the togne? Would they have gotten it from the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. རྫོང] A district in the traditional Tibetan governmental structure. This large administrative unit was headed by one or two district heads (tib. dzongpön [རྫོང་དཔོན]) appointed by the Tibetan government. Typically there was one lay official and one monk official who were jointly sent from Lhasa for three year terms. They were responsible for collecting taxes and adjudicating disputes in their district. These dzong were equivalent to counties (ch. 县) in the current Chinese system of administration.">dzong</a> or what? Did they have to go ask for it? Was the ordinary <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. རྩེ་དྲུང] A monk official in the Tibetan government.">tsidrung</a> the lowest rank and the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ལས་ཚན་པ] The name for officials of the 5th rank in the traditional Tibetan government.">letsenpa</a> was just above this?   

**A:**  Yes.   

**Q:**  Who was above the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ལས་ཚན་པ] The name for officials of the 5th rank in the traditional Tibetan government.">letsenpa</a>?   

**A:**  There were some high and low <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ལས་ཚན་པ] The name for officials of the 5th rank in the traditional Tibetan government.">letsenpa</a> of which the tsendrön was the highest. The next was the shöndrön. The next was the fifth rank [Tib. གནས་ལྔ་པ] letsenpa, the sixth rank letsenpa [Tib. གནས་དྲུག་པའི་ལས་ཚན་པ], and the seventh rank letsenpa [Tib. གནས་བདུན་པའི་ལས་ཚན་པ].   

**Q:**  What was the fifth rank <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ལས་ཚན་པ] The name for officials of the 5th rank in the traditional Tibetan government.">letsenpa</a>?   

**A:**  They were like the treasurers: <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. རྩེ] The Potala Palace.">Tse</a> <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. གཉེར་ཚང] 1. Storehouse. 2. Steward, person in charge of a storehouse. 3. A monastic official in charge of storerooms.">nyertsang</a>, Lhasa nyertsang and shölnyer [Tib. ཞོལ་གཉེར].   

**Q:**  The others, like the official in charge of the religious decorations [Tib. ཆོས་རྫས་དོ་དམ] and the official in charge of the scriptures [Tib. ཕྱག་དཔེ་དོ་དམ], were all <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ལས་ཚན་པ] The name for officials of the 5th rank in the traditional Tibetan government.">letsenpa</a>, right?   

**A:**  Yes.   

**Q:**  Who was above the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ལས་ཚན་པ] The name for officials of the 5th rank in the traditional Tibetan government.">letsenpa</a>?   

**A:**  It was the khenjung.   

**Q:**  How many tsendrön were there?   

**A:**  There were probably 16-17 of them.   

**Q:**  How many <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཤོད་མགྲོན] Monk officials working in the Secretariat of the Regent. They were something like an aide-de-camp.">shöndrön</a> were there?   

**A:**  There were 7-8 of them.   

**Q:**  If there was the regent and also the prime minister, would there have been two <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. སྣེ་མགྲོན] The monk official in charge of the Regent&#x27;s Secretariat Office (shöga). He was the equivalent of the Lord Chamberlain in the Dalai Lama&#x27;s Secretariat.">nendrön</a>?   

**A:**  There would have been just one.   

**Q:**  What was the rank of the lay officials?   

**A:**  It was the same.   

**Q:**  The lowest were the ordinary lay officials, kyüma.   

**A:**  Yes.   

**Q:**  Would they call them kyüma <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ལས་ཚན་པ] The name for officials of the 5th rank in the traditional Tibetan government.">letsenpa</a>?   

**A:**  They were the same [as the tsidrung].   

**Q:**  There were no tsendrön or <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཤོད་མགྲོན] Monk officials working in the Secretariat of the Regent. They were something like an aide-de-camp.">shöndrön</a> among the lay officials, right?   

**A:**  Right.   

**Q:**  There were also the fifth, sixth, and seventh rank [Tib. གནས] <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ལས་ཚན་པ] The name for officials of the 5th rank in the traditional Tibetan government.">letsenpa</a> among the lay officials, right?   

**A:**  Yes, the treasurers, like the Lhasa <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. གཉེར་ཚང] 1. Storehouse. 2. Steward, person in charge of a storehouse. 3. A monastic official in charge of storerooms.">nyertsang</a> and the shölnyer were of the fifth rank, and the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. བཀའ་དྲུང] Aide/secretary to the Kashag. There were usually two of these, both aristocratic lay officials. Their job was to assist the Kalöns, and their usual work involved writing whatever letters, documents, orders, and recommendations the Kashag sent to the Dalai Lama and other offices. Their office was called the Dröndrungkhang [tib. མགྲོན་དྲུང་ཁང].">kadrung</a> were also of the fifth rank. The <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. རུ་དཔོན] A military officer in the traditional Tibetan Army just below a depön (commander). Rupön were usually in charge of half of a regiment (something like a battalion).">rupön</a> were also probably fifth rank letsenpa.   

**Q:**  The tseja, laja, the head of the payroll [Tib. ཕོགས་དཔོན], and the tsipön were all of the fourth rank, right? What about the judicial system where the civil disputes were settled, Gyöship?   

**A:**  Yes, the head of the Gyöship was Yuthok. After he became the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. བཀའ་ཚབ] An acting Kalön.">katsab</a>, Menkyiling [Tib. སྨོན་སྐྱིད་གླིང] became the head.   

**Q:**  The head of the Gyöship was a third rank official, <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. རྫ་ས] 1. A high rank in the Tibetan government. 2. A top manager-like official for the labrang of important incarnate lamas, especially those who in the past had served as regents of Tibet.">dzasa</a>, right?   

**A:**  Yes.   

**Q:**  Among the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. རྩེ་དྲུང] A monk official in the Tibetan government.">tsidrung</a>, there were three class/ ranks [Tib. གྲལ་རིམ]: the better tsidrung [Tib. དྲུང་དྲག], the middle tsidrung [Tib. དྲུང་འབྲིང] and the ordinary tsidrung [Tib. དྲུང་དཀྱུས]. What was the difference between them?   

**A:**  I don't know who those people were. Anyway, probably, the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. རྩེ་དྲུང] A monk official in the Tibetan government.">tsidrung</a> who had large estates were the better ones and the tsidrung who had smaller estates than that were in the middle class. Those who had small estates were the ordinary tsidrung.   

**Q:**  But most of the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. རྩེ་དྲུང] A monk official in the Tibetan government.">tsidrung</a> probably didn't have estates. So they belonged to the ordinary tsidrung, right? When you were the tsidrung, how many better tsidrung, middle tsidrung, and ordinary tsidrung were there?   

**A:**  There were several <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. རྩེ་དྲུང] A monk official in the Tibetan government.">tsidrung</a> who had bigger estates who were called the better ones, and the next were those who had slightly smaller estates, and they were the middle class. And the ordinary tsidrung didn't have estates.   

**Q:**  Tsidrung like Trekhang and Rong Namsey (Jawdang) [Tib. རོང་རྣམ་སྲས] were the better ones, right?   

**A:**  Tsidrung like Barshi [Tib. བར་གཞིས] had very large estates.   

**Q:**  But, most <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. རྩེ་དྲུང] A monk official in the Tibetan government.">tsidrung</a> didn't [have] estates, right?   

**A:**  Yes, most of them didn't have estates.   

**Q:**  So they became ordinary <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. རྩེ་དྲུང] A monk official in the Tibetan government.">tsidrung</a>, right?   

**Q:**  How many <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. རྩེ་དྲུང] A monk official in the Tibetan government.">tsidrung</a> were there when you became a tsidrung?   

**A:**  The limit was 175 tsidrung.   

**Q:**  But, actually, there were more than that, right?   

**A:**  Yes, there were a few more than that.   

**Q:**  Supposing there were 200 <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. རྩེ་དྲུང] A monk official in the Tibetan government.">tsidrung</a>, were there about 20 who had estates?   

**A:**  There were less than that.   

**Q:**  At that time, you had estates. But how could the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. རྩེ་དྲུང] A monk official in the Tibetan government.">tsidrung</a> recruited from the great monasteries as a tax [Tib. གྲྭ་འཕྱགས] and who became the tsidrung through the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. རྩེ་སློབ་གྲྭ] The school for training monk officials in the Potala that was run by the Yigtsang (Ecclesiastic) Office.">Tse labdra</a> [Tib. རྩེ་སློབ་གྲྭ], have made their living?   

**A:**  In the early times, there were the students in the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. རྩེ་སློབ་གྲྭ] The school for training monk officials in the Potala that was run by the Yigtsang (Ecclesiastic) Office.">Tse labdra</a> who were recruited to become <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. རྩེ་དྲུང] A monk official in the Tibetan government.">tsidrung</a> as a tax. Later, though, in 1954, there were just four to five of them.   

**Q:**  It was not in 1954 when you became the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. རྩེ་དྲུང] A monk official in the Tibetan government.">tsidrung</a>, right?   

**A:**  At that time, I was living in India.   

**Q:**  How about at the time of <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. སྟག་བྲག] The regent of Tibet who replaced Reting in 1941 and served until 1950 when the 14th Dalai Lama assumed power.">Taktra</a>?   

**A:**  There were only 7-10 of them.   

**Q:**  Do you mean the better class <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. རྩེ་དྲུང] A monk official in the Tibetan government.">tsidrung</a>?   

**A:**  No, I mean the students in the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. རྩེ] The Potala Palace.">Tse</a> labdra.   

**Q:**  Where did they come from?   

**A:**  There were two different kinds of <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. རྩེ་སློབ་གྲྭ] The school for training monk officials in the Potala that was run by the Yigtsang (Ecclesiastic) Office.">Tse labdra</a> students: the private students [Tib. སྒེར་པ] and the government students [Tib. གཞུང་པ]. The government students were those recruited from the monasteries as a tax. Some of them were also from government official families, they were called private students.   

**Q:**  Were the government students poorer?   

**A:**  Not really poorer, they were recruited as a tax.   

**Q:**  You didn't go to the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. རྩེ་སློབ་གྲྭ] The school for training monk officials in the Potala that was run by the Yigtsang (Ecclesiastic) Office.">Tse labdra</a>, right?   

**A:**  Yes, there were more <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. རྩེ་དྲུང] A monk official in the Tibetan government.">tsidrung</a> who didn't go to the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. རྩེ] The Potala Palace.">Tse</a> labdra.   

**Q:**  I heard that it was very hard to become a <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. རྩེ་དྲུང] A monk official in the Tibetan government.">tsidrung</a> from the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. རྩེ་སློབ་གྲྭ] The school for training monk officials in the Potala that was run by the Yigtsang (Ecclesiastic) Office.">Tse labdra</a>?   

**A:**  They just went through the motion of saying that. Actually, some of them had some difficulties and some of them were better. Since they were recruited into the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. རྩེ་སློབ་གྲྭ] The school for training monk officials in the Potala that was run by the Yigtsang (Ecclesiastic) Office.">Tse labdra</a>, they had equal rights to become a <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. རྩེ་དྲུང] A monk official in the Tibetan government.">tsidrung</a>, but they had to select some of them at one time according to the exam.   

**Q:**  It was not only through the exam, they were pulling up many of them. So there were very old students left there in the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. རྩེ་སློབ་གྲྭ] The school for training monk officials in the Potala that was run by the Yigtsang (Ecclesiastic) Office.">Tse labdra</a>, right? Did you have to go show what you looked like (appearance) in front of the authorities [Tib. མི་བབ་སྤྱན་ཞུ]?   

**A:**  Yes.   

**Q:**  What would that have been [like]? Please, tell us in detail how did you go there to do that?   

**A:**  I just wore my regular clothes.   

**Q:**  Did you get dressed up?   

**A:**  No, I didn't.   

**Q:**  There wasn't any ceremony at home, right?   

**A:**  Yes.   

**Q:**  This was after you applied to the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཡིག་ཚང] The highest office dealing with monastic and religious affairs in the traditional Tibetan government. It is often called the Ecclesiastic Office. It was headed by 4 fourth rank monk officials called Trunyichemmo. The senior Trunyichemmo was called Ta Lama.">Yigtsang</a>, right?   

**A:**  As for me, I didn't need to do that because my application was granted. Usually, there were two new <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. རྩེ་དྲུང] A monk official in the Tibetan government.">tsidrung</a> at the New Year. For the two tsidrung, there were four candidates selected and the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཡིག་ཚང] The highest office dealing with monastic and religious affairs in the traditional Tibetan government.

**Q:**  They didn't wear the brocade vest [Tib. གོས་ཆེན་སྟོད་འགག], did they?   

**A:**  Usually—if they would wear it regularly, then they would wear it. Then they would have had to go to the front of the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. རྩེ་ཕྱག] 1. The Treasury Office that was located in the Potala and supplied items for the Dalai Lama. 2. The name/title of the officials who headed the Tseja Office.">Tseja</a> Office.

**A:**  Yes.   

**Q:**  What else would the Dalai Lama do?   

**A:**  He would just have a look. That's all that it was.   

**Q:**  Didn't he look at their handwriting?   

**A:**  This was done before that. This was just to show their appearance.   

**Q:**  Where did they check their handwriting?   

**A:**  They checked that in the Yigtsang. They just had to write something and submit it to the Yigtsang.   

**Q:**  Did they put a mark on it?   

**A:**  There wasn't any mark on it.   

**Q:**  Did you have to write it there in the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཡིག་ཚང] The highest office dealing with monastic and religious affairs in the traditional Tibetan government. It is often called the Ecclesiastic Office. It was headed by 4 fourth rank monk officials called Trunyichemmo.

**A:**  You had to write it in front of them.   

**Q:**  Did they dictate to you what to write?   

**A:**  You could write whatever you liked.   

**Q:**  How much did you have to write?   

**A:**  I had to write a Tsugtung, a form of alphabet that's not as small as cursive. And then the Tsugmakhyug [Tib. ཚུགས་མ་འཁྱུག], smaller letters mixed with cursive [Tib. འཁྱུག]. I could write whatever verses I wanted to write, like a verse praising the Dalai Lama.   

**Q:**  Would this writing go up to the regent? Or did it just go to the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཡིག་ཚང] The highest office dealing with monastic and religious affairs in the traditional Tibetan government. It is often called the Ecclesiastic Office. It was headed by 4 fourth rank monk officials called Trunyichemmo. The senior Trunyichemmo was called Ta Lama.">Yigtsang</a>?   

**A:**    

**Q:**  What would the four people do when they were standing there?   

**A:**  We didn't need to do anything. We just had to stand over there. Somebody would give all of us a sign.   

**Q:**  Then you had to go back, right?   

**A:**  Yes.   

**Q:**  What would happen then?   

**A:**  Then it would be decided and they would receive notice regarding whoever may be appointed according to the plan and the approval [Tib. འཆར་གཞི་ཕྱག་རྟགས].   

**Q:**  Would they receive notice on that day?   

**A:**  Yes.   

**Q:**  What happened to the other two?   

**A:**  They would get the next chance.   

**Q:**  If they didn't get it on the next chance?   

**A:**  If somebody didn't get it even after two chances, they might have gotten it on the third or the fourth chance.   

**Q:**  Eventually, they would get it, right?   

**A:**  Yes, after two chances they would get it.   

**Q:**  As for the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. རྩེ་དྲུང] A monk official in the Tibetan government.">tsidrung</a>, didn't you have to offer the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཁ་བཏགས] A Tibetan ceremonial scarf given to lamas, visitors, etc.">khata</a> called the reporting khata [Tib. སྙན་སེང་མཇལ་དར]?   

**A:**  Yes, it was called the "reporting <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཁ་བཏགས] A Tibetan ceremonial scarf given to lamas, visitors, etc.">khata</a> for becoming a <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. རྩེ་དྲུང] A monk official in the Tibetan government.">tsidrung</a>," Shabdö Nyendar [Tib. ཞབས་སྡོད་སྙན་དར].   

**Q:**  I heard that sometimes they would return the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཁ་བཏགས] A Tibetan ceremonial scarf given to lamas, visitors, etc.">khata</a>. When did you have to offer this reporting khata?   

**A:**  This must have been the first step for seeking permission to become a tsidrung.   

**Q:**  They should have sought this permission from the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཡིག་ཚང] The highest office dealing with monastic and religious affairs in the traditional Tibetan government. It is often called the Ecclesiastic Office. It was headed by 4 fourth rank monk officials called Trunyichemmo. The senior Trunyichemmo was called Ta Lama.">Yigtsang</a>, right?   

**A:**  Yes, this <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཁ་བཏགས] A Tibetan ceremonial scarf given to lamas, visitors, etc.">khata</a> should have been a nangdzö.   

**Q:**  I heard that if the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཁ་བཏགས] A Tibetan ceremonial scarf given to lamas, visitors, etc.">khata</a> was not good (quality), they would return it to them.   

**A:**  It was regarded as an important thing.   

**Q:**  Among the 200 <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. རྩེ་དྲུང] A monk official in the Tibetan government.">tsidrung</a>, how many would go through the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. རྩེ་སློབ་གྲྭ] The school for training monk officials in the Potala that was run by the Yigtsang (Ecclesiastic) Office.">Tse labdra</a> school?   

**A:**  In the beginning, there were not many people who wanted to become a <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. རྩེ་དྲུང] A monk official in the Tibetan government.">tsidrung</a>. So they set up the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. རྩེ་སློབ་གྲྭ] The school for training monk officials in the Potala that was run by the Yigtsang (Ecclesiastic) Office.">Tse labdra</a>, but later, they became tsidrung directly, and the Tse labdra sort of became unnecessary and there were just a few students. The lessons were good, but it had strict discipline, so just a few students joined the school.   

**Q:**  In the beginning, all the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. རྩེ་དྲུང] A monk official in the Tibetan government.">tsidrung</a> coming from the three great monasteries had to go through the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. རྩེ་སློབ་གྲྭ] The school for training monk officials in the Potala that was run by the Yigtsang (Ecclesiastic) Office.">Tse labdra</a> and gradually, they would become tsidrung, right?   

**A:**  Yes.   

**Q:**  At the time of the two regents, <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. སྟག་བྲག] The regent of Tibet who replaced Reting in 1941 and served until 1950 when the 14th Dalai Lama assumed power.">Taktra</a> and Reting, how many <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. རྩེ་དྲུང] A monk official in the Tibetan government.">tsidrung</a> went through the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. རྩེ་སློབ་གྲྭ] The school for training monk officials in the Potala that was run by the Yigtsang (Ecclesiastic) Office.">Tse labdra</a> and how many of them became tsidrung directly?   

**A:**  I can't tell you clearly. Anyway, later on, there were only four to five students in the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. རྩེ] The Potala Palace.">Tse</a> labdra. Compared to the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. རྩེ་དྲུང] A monk official in the Tibetan government.">tsidrung</a> who went through the Tse labdra with the tsidrung who didn't go through the Tse labdra, there were more tsidrung who didn't go through the Tse labdra.   

**Q:**  How many more?   

**A:**  I can't tell you that.   

**Q:**  What percentage?   

**A:**  There were more than 20-30 percent who didn't go through the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. རྩེ] The Potala Palace.">Tse</a> labdra.   

**Q:**  Later, there were no more students going to the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. རྩེ་སློབ་གྲྭ] The school for training monk officials in the Potala that was run by the Yigtsang (Ecclesiastic) Office.">Tse labdra</a>, right?   

**A:**  I heard that they had a plan for the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. རྩེ་སློབ་གྲྭ] The school for training monk officials in the Potala that was run by the Yigtsang (Ecclesiastic) Office.">Tse labdra</a> to make changes for recruiting new students.   

**Q:**  Did they call your household a <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཤག་ཚང] 1. The household or family of a monk that consisted of multiple monks. 2.

The senior monks are usually served tea with a lot of shag.">shag</a> that had better living conditions many pupils were called shagtsang.   

**Q:**  In the monasteries, there were two to three pupils in one shagtsang. The <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. རྩེ་དྲུང] A monk official in the Tibetan government.">tsidrung</a> probably only had one to two pupils, right?   

**A:**  Yes.   

**Q:**  How would they manage their <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཤག་ཚང] 1. The household or family of a monk that consisted of multiple monks. 2. The apartment of a monk household.">shagtsang</a>? They should have kept at least one pupil [in order] to become a <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. རྩེ་དྲུང] A monk official in the Tibetan government.">tsidrung</a> in the future, right? Some of them also had two pupils, right?

**A:**  Every <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. རྩེ་དྲུང] A monk official in the Tibetan government.">tsidrung</a> did not necessarily have a shagtsang. If they had someone to become a tsidrung, then they had a shagtsang. If they didn't have that, then they didn't have a shagtsang.   

**Q:**  Did they become <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. རྩེ་དྲུང] A monk official in the Tibetan government.">tsidrung</a> in the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཤག་ཚང] 1. The household or family of a monk that consisted of multiple monks. 2. The apartment of a monk household.">shagtsang</a> for inheriting property [Tib. རྒྱུད་པ་འཛིན]?   

**A:**  It was something like that.   

**Q:**  Suppose you, Kungö, were to keep a pupil who was related to you or a lover. Would he inherit all of your property, like the things you got from the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. རྫོང] A district in the traditional Tibetan governmental structure.

**A:**  There wasn't any difference between the lay officials and <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. རྩེ་དྲུང] A monk official in the Tibetan government.">tsidrung</a> on this matter. It depended on whether the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. རྫོང] A district in the traditional Tibetan governmental structure.

**Q:**  Among the offices in Lhasa, like the treasury, Nyertsang, and the Branch Judicial Office for settling civil disputes [Tib. གྱོད་ཞིབ], which of the offices would receive the most bribes?   

**A:**  In the past, the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. བླ་ཕྱག] 1.

**Q:**  Normally, when you would go to the office, what daily work would you do, starting from the morning? Was there anyone making you do work or what? What time would you start working?   

**A:**  We had to arrive at the office at 10 a.m. There wasn't any lunch break and we would work until 4 p.m. When there was a lot of work, we would work until 5-6 p.m. Each office had different work and the leader would assign the work.

**Q:**  The kalön would appoint the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. རྫོང་དཔོན] The head of a dzong in the traditional Tibetan government.">dzongpön</a>, right?

**Q:**  When did that happen?   

**A:**  This was probably in 1948-49. Before that, some of the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. རྫོང] A district in the traditional Tibetan governmental structure.

**Q:**  When they were appointing the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. རྫོང་དཔོན] The head of a dzong in the traditional Tibetan government.">dzongpön</a> separately, if you wanted to become a dzongpön, did you have to request permission from the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཡིག་ཚང] The highest office dealing with monastic and religious affairs in the traditional Tibetan government.

**A:**  If we wanted to become a <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. རྫོང་དཔོན] The head of a dzong in the traditional Tibetan government.">dzongpön</a> while we were working in Lhasa, we were allowed to request permission from the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཡིག་ཚང] The highest office dealing with monastic and religious affairs in the traditional Tibetan government.

**A:**  That would have been quite hard.   

**Q:**  Could you do that sometimes?   

**A:**  Yes, we could do that sometimes, but mostly, it was impossible. There weren't many <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. རྫོང] A district in the traditional Tibetan governmental structure.

**Q:**  Some of the foreigners considered the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. རྩེ་དྲུང] A monk official in the Tibetan government.">tsidrung</a> to belong to the monks. But, according to my point of view, the lay officials and tsidrung were government officials and they were better off, and the three great monasteries were separate. The tsidrung were monks and they had loyalty towards the government, but the monks in the three great monasteries didn't think about the government, right?   

**A:**  The people outside would have thought that all the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. རྩེ་དྲུང] A monk official in the Tibetan government.">tsidrung</a> came from one of the great monasteries. So they would stand on the side of the monastery.   

**Q:**  What was the main regular job of the jigyab <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. མཁན་པོ] Abbot of a monastery or monastic college.">khembo</a>?
