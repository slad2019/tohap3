<h3 id="tape-1">Tape 1</h3>
<p><strong>Q:</strong> [Editor&apos;s note. Goldstein and Wang Gui sometimes spoke in Tibetan, but when Wang Gui spoke in Chinese, a translator translated that for Goldstein]  You were among the Northwest Army [Ch. xibei jun], right?   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  No, I was among the Southeast Army [Ch. xinan jun] and I was among the Advance Troops [Tib. mdun skyod dmag dpung] [Ch. xian qian bu dui] of the 18th Army [Ch. shi ba jun] who came the first time to Tibet.  </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  Was that in 1951?   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong> It was in 1950 and I was there when the Chamdo War took place. I came to Lhasa along with Zhang Guohua and Tan Guansan, and when the Chamdo War took place, I was with Wang Qimei.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong> At that time, Wang Qimei was the Committee Member of the Chamdo Liberation Committee [Tib. chab mdo bcings &#x2018;grol u yon lhan khang gi u yon], right?  </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong> Yes, you are right, and I was there when they set up the Liberation Committee.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  You know a lot about the history, right?   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  When they started the Chamdo Liberation Committee, they needed a house which could hold about 300-400 people, and when Chamdo was about to be liberated, there wasn&#x2019;t such a big house. So we didn&#x2019;t have a house to hold the meeting. Therefore Wang Qimei hurried up and took the section leader [Ch. ke zhang] of our Reconnoitre Section [Ch. zhen cha ke] and went around Chamdo to find a house which could hold about 300-400 people. The assembly hall of the Chamdo Champaling [Tib. byams pa gling] Monastery could hold about 200 people. However, it was not good to hold the meeting in the monastery, right? Our section leader said that we could build a house, and after about a month, they built the house. There was an abundance of wood in Chamdo, but they didn&#x2019;t have many bricks. At that time, we were hungry and food was scarce, but they could build the house in a little more than a month. Chamdo was liberated in October and they built the house in December, and it took a little more than a month. The meeting was held in that house. Ngab&#xF6;, Ts&#xF6;go [Tib. mtsho sgo], Phagpalha [Tib. &#x2018;phags pa lha], and Traya Londen Sherab [Tib. brag g.yab blo ldan shes rab] et cetera, and all the Huthogthu attended the meeting. Also the people from Jomda [Tib. mjo mda&#x2019;], Traya [Tib. brag g.yab], and Riwoche [Tib. ri bo che], Markham [Tib. smar khams], Dzogang [Tib. mdzo sgang], Sanggna Ch&#xF6;dzong [Tib. gsang sngags chos rdzong] and Pomi [Tib. spo mi] attended the meeting.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong> At that time, you were young, right?  </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong> I was 19 years old [laughter] when I came to Chamdo and 20 years old when I arrived in Lhasa.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  After you came to Lhasa, did you stay in Lhasa continuously?   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  Mainly, I stayed in Lhasa. I also stayed in Yadong for about 5 years at the border, and I also stayed in Posumdzom [Tib. spo bo gsum &#x2018;dzoms] for quite a long time. And then I also stayed in T&#xF6; Trad&#xFC;n [Tib. stod bkra mdun] and Drongpa [Tib. &#x2018;brong pa] for a couple of years.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong> Where is Drongpa located?  </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  It is located at the north side of the Mustang [Tib. glo sman thang] which is a completely nomad area. I also stayed in Shigatse and Gyantse. Your Tibetan is quite good and you can understand what I say, right?  </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  It is just so-so [Tib. da ga se red]. You went from the east to the west, and from the south to the north to many different places. When did you stay in Lhasa, I mean from what time?   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  I came to Lhasa in October 1951 along with Zhang Guohua and Tan Guansan. Then after about a month, I went to Gyantse. I stayed about 8 months there and then I went to Shigatse. I came back to Lhasa in 1952 and stayed in Lhasa until 1954, and then I went to Yadong. And in 1959, I came to Lhasa, and I was in Lhasa when they made war in Lhasa and the revolt took place. In 1963, I went to Potramog [Tib. spo bo spra rmog] Sumdzong and in 1964, I came to Lhasa again. In 1965, I went to T&#xF6; Drongpa and Trad&#xFC;n, and stayed there for about a year. And then I came back to Lhasa and mainly stayed in Lhasa, and I also went everywhere, like Chamdo.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong> How did you learn Tibetan?  </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong> I learned Tibetan by myself with great effort.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  Your Tibetan is fluent and your pronunciation is good.   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  As for us, learning Tibetan was our duty. We were told that all the members of the 18th Army must learn the Tibetan language and writing well, and that Zhang Jingwu of the Tibet Party Committee [Ch. qu dang wei] was very concerned about this and talked many times that we must learn Tibetan. We were in the Reconnoitre Section, which was the Intelligence Office [Tib. gsang ba&#x2019;i las khungs].   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong> It was very important to know Tibetan, right?  </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong> Yes, our section leader would stress that very much, saying that if you don&#x2019;t know Tibetan, it is like [being] a deaf and blind [person], and you can&#x2019;t do any work in Tibet because we&apos;d have to ask the Tibetans for information. And at that time, interpreters were very rare. In our office there was only one interpreter and about ten cadres, so I learned Tibetan [the] hard [way] from the interpreter, who was the teacher, and he wrote a dictionary by hand. In Kangding [Tib. dar rtse mdo], they found a Chinese-Tibetan dictionary [Ch. han zang zi dian] compiled by the Teacher&#x2019;s College [Ch. shi fan xue yuan] of the GMD, and about ten of us copied this dictionary by hand over about 2 years. This dictionary had about 300-400 pages. Even now, this dictionary is displayed in the Military Exhibition [Ch. jun shi guan] in the Tibet Military Command Area.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong> This is very good. I also compiled a dictionary where I did the same by studying by myself and writing a few words on paper, and when I got many words, then I published a book.   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  You have great devotion to one&#x2019;s work [Ch. shi ye xing hen qiang] [Tib. khur sems chen po &#x2018;dug].   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong> No matter if it is useful or not, if I am doing a lot of work I feel happy, and I don&#x2019;t feel happy if I stay relaxed [not working].   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  We Chinese also hard working people, like you, who do some real works [Ch. shi shi] internationally.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  Thank you.   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  I will write something for you to keep as a remembrance [Ch. ji nyan] [keepsake]. It is written in the love song of Tshanyang Gyatso [Tib. tshangs dbyangs rgya mtsho], &#x201C;The bright moon arose from the top of the mountain in the east and the face of the mother who didn&#x2019;t give birth to me appeared in my mind [Tib. shar phyogs ri bo&#x2019;i rtse nas/ dkar gsal lza ba shar byung/ ma skyes a ma&#x2019;i zhal ras/ yid la &#x2018;khor &#x2018;khor byas byung] [Ch. zai dong fang de shan ding shang/ sheng qi liao jiao jei the yue liang/ wo jian wei sheng mu qing de lian pang zai wo xin zhong dang yiang]. This was a famous poem.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong> Your handwriting is good.   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  It is just ordinary [Tib. spyir btang]. Do you like Tibetan songs?  </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  I don&#x2019;t like them that much because I don&#x2019;t know the songs and those things well.   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  There are many good Tibetan songs, and the best are the songs in Markham and Batang. I know a lot of those songs because, at that time, we danced along with the Tibetan miser.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong> My teachers were Tibetan kudrak in America and they didn&#x2019;t know many of those Khamba and Batang dialects and songs.  </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  Who were those Tibetan kudrak you met?  </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  One of them was the Nornang Geshe La [Tib. nor nang dge bshes lags].   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  Norgye Nangpa [Tib. nor rgyas nang pa], right?   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong> Yes, he was a Geshe from the Dagpo [Tib. dwags po] Tratsang. In 1960, they invited a Tibetan teacher, as the Americans [profedssors] didn&#x2019;t know [spoken] Tibetan, so there was Geshe La and there was another teacher called Gyarsib Lhadr&#xF6;n La [Tib. skyar srib lha sgron la], who was not from a big family. The two of them were the Tibetan teachers.  </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong> Lhadr&#xF6;n La was a girl, right?   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  Yes, both of them were kind people. So I studied hard like you and learned Tibetan. Since my teachers were kudrak, I learned fluent Lhasa honorific dialect, like say asking, &#x201C;Is it like this or is it not like this [Tib. yinpa no man pa no]?&quot; Later when I went to the countryside and when I asked them, &#x201C;Is this the toilet or is it not [Tib. &#x2018;di gsang spyod yinpa no man pa no],&quot; they laughed at me and they didn&#x2019;t understand [the honorifics]. Later, they got used to it.   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  I haven&#x2019;t met Norgye Nangpa, but I worked with the Norgye La [Tib. nor rgyas lags] in Yadong for about two years.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong> In the past, I married the daughter of Surkhang who was the daughter of the elder sister of Surkhang Kal&#xF6;n.   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong> Surkhang Kal&#xF6;n&#x2019;s wife was from Yuthok.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong> [misunderstood] No, she was the daughter of the Surkhang sister who was married to Shelkar Linga [Tib. shel dkar gling pa]. Now we are divorced, but we are still friendly and there are many relatives in Lhasa.   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong> Have you met Surkhang Kal&#xF6;n?   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong> Yes.  </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong> I have been to the home of Surkhang Kal&#xF6;n many times and have talked with him many times. At that time, the Vice Commander [Tib. fu si ling yuan] of our Military Command Area was called Lijun, do you know him?   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  No.  </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  Zhang Guohua and Tan Guansan were the Commanders [Ch. si ling yuan] and the Political Commissar [Ch. zheng wei], and the Vice Political Commissar was Wang Qimei and the Chief of the Staff [Ch. can mou zhang] was Lijun, who arrived in Lhasa and was promoted to the Vice Commander and became the combined Vice Commander and the Chief of the Staff. When they built the highway from Kham to Tibet, Cheng Mingyi was in charge of the work in the rear area [Ch. hou fang], where he had two divisions [Tib. shi] working for the 18th Army. We were the Advance Troops [Ch. xian qian dui] and there were more people behind us. They were to build the road from Ganzi to Chamdo and went through a lot of hardships. When our regiment built the road from the west to the south, we took mainly about 10 thousand Tibetan farmers and built the road. These people were recruited from 48 dzongs and estates located in the places from Lhasa to Kongpo. At that time, they call them ula (corvee laborers); we made the miser work but paid them dayan silver coins. At that time, the Tibet Military Command Area and the Kashag jointly set up a Road Building Committee [Tib. lam bzo&#x2019;i u yon lhan khang], with the director [Ch. zhu ren] being Tan Guansan. There were also three vice directors. The first was Surkhang Kal&#xF6;n, the second was Lijun, and the third was the Director of the Political Bureau [Tib. zheng zhi bu], Liu Zhenguo. When the road was being built, it was decided that we [the Chinese] shall pay the money and they shall make the miser work and provide the grain, and we shall pay the cost of the grain. We bought the implements, like hoes and shovels, from India. We made the work assignments like this and there was a lot of work, and the Joint Road Building Committee held a meeting once a week. When they held the meetings, Lijun needed a young interpreter, and I was appointed as the interpreter by the section leader of the Reconnoitre Section. He insisted on me doing that, though at that time, I didn&#x2019;t know Tibetan well, and I could [only] say some of the words, but couldn&#x2019;t say some others. However, I worked hard, and when I couldn&#x2019;t say some words, they would laugh at me. Anyway, I worked hard by being the interpreter, and also learning Tibetan, and Surkhang taught me quite a lot. After being the interpreter for about a year, I improved a lot. I had been to Surkhang&#x2019;s home many times as the interpreter for Lijun regarding the road building. Surkhang was eloquent and would talk with us nicely, but he had done a lot of rubbish [Tib. za re zo re] works from the behind the scene.[laughter].   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong> This was the work style of the aristocrats.  </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  Yes, you are right. However, Surkhang would do more of these things and he was kind of a mediocre [Tib. khrig khrig] person, verbally saying that it is important to build the road, but when the PLA treated the miser very nicely, the miser never thought that they would get paid wages because there wasn&#x2019;t any wages paid in the past. So when we paid the wages, they were very glad. However, the money was taken by the heads, like the estate managers, and they told the miser that this was not for them. They did that because those people were agricultural serfs [Tib. zhing pa bren g.yog]. However, later we took [used different] methods, and gave them boots and tea bricks, which the heads couldn&#x2019;t keep, and we treated the miser very kindly. When the heads and the chandz&#xF6; beat the miser, the miser liked the PLA and they didn&#x2019;t like the kudrak, shid&#xF6; or the shinyer. After 1-2 years, the miser knew about these things, and Surkhang untied his head knot and wore an ordinary Tibetan dress, and went to watch the road building sites from Lhasa to Metrogongkar [Tib. mal gro gung dkar] and those places. When there was a situation where the miser became very friendly with the PLA and they didn&#x2019;t like the kudrak, Surkhang was very much worried about this, and on the way back to Lhasa, Surkhang told me, &#x201C;There will be an earthquake in Tibet.&#x201D; He was very much worried that their system will not be stable. In the beginning, Surkhang himself told me that, &#x201C;There will be an earthquake in Tibet,&#x201D; but later these were the reasons for launching the revolt.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  Nowadays, I am doing some research on how the revolt took place, so please tell me a little bit about this. You were in Lhasa in 1959, right?   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  Yes, I was there.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  In what month did you come back to Lhasa?   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  It was in February when I came to Lhasa from Yadong, and the revolt was just about to break out. And at that time, I was in the Intelligence Office [Tib. so pa&apos;i las khungs].  </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  Where was the Intelligence Office located?   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  It was in the headquarters [Ch. si ling bu] of the Military Command Area, which was then called the New Regiment or Magar sarpa [Tib. dmag sgar gsar pa], and the Combat Department [Ch. zuo zhan chu] was in Magar sarpa, and I was staying in Polingga [Tib. spo bo gling ga]. Do you know Polingga?   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  Yes.   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  This is the place where the sport field [Tib. lus rtsal thang] [Ch. ti yu chang] is now built. We moved there for the time being and when the war took place, we were in Polingga. As for the main reason of that [the revolt], the CIA [Ch. zhong yiang qing bao ju] [Tib. gsang ba&#x2019;i las khungs] of the American government, starting from 1951, 1952, 1953 and 1954, through Taktse Rimpoche [Tib. stag &#x2018;tsher rin po che] and Gyalo Thondup [Tib. rgya lo don grub], made relations many times with Surkhang, Liushar [Tib. sne&#x2019;u shar] and those Kal&#xF6;n, saying, &quot;We can support Tibetan independence. However, there should be a condition [Tib. mthun rkyen] or reason [Tib. rgyu rkyen], and the main condition is that the Dalai Lama would need to go [Tib. phebs dgos kyi &#x2018;dug] abroad. If the Dalai Lama would be held in the hands of the CCP, we cannot support Tibetan independence. If the Dalai Lama would be able to arrive abroad, then we can [Tib. byed chog gi red] strongly support Tibetan independence.&quot; They had this talk. Surkhang and Liushar kept the talk of the American CIA in their mind and they had great enthusiasm [Tib. sems shugs chen po] toward taking the Dalai Lama abroad. They were saying that as long as they could do that, the US would support us. They tried to do that three times. The first one was in 1951, when the Dalai Lama went to Yadong and around the time when the 17-Point Agreement was signed, they said that he must go to India, but this didn&#x2019;t work out and failed because Zhang Jingwu came over. There were two groups in the Kashag. Some of them were saying that the Dalai Lama should return to Lhasa and some of them were saying that the Dalai Lama should go to India. They debated a lot and then he came to Lhasa. The second was when the Dalai Lama went to India for the Buddha Jayanti. At that time, Taktse Rimpoche and Gyalo Thondup both came, and Zhou Enlai and Nehru talked with the Dalai Lama. This also failed and he came back. In 1958 and the beginning of 1959, there was the revolt in Kham and Tibet and many people of Chushigandru came the places around Lhasa. When I was in Yadong, Chushigandru came through Kalimpong and Gangtok to Yadong, and then they went to Dowa Dzong and Lhoka Drigu [Tib. gri gu]. Everyday, they came in groups of ten, and about 20-30 altogether. There were about 700-800 of them. At that time, we wouldn&#x2019;t stop them and they were free to go. They lost the revolt in Kham and then went to Kalimpong, and the US helped them and they came back. After they came to Drigu, they came to Lhasa, and there was Andrutsang Gombo Tashi [Tib. a &#x2018;brug tshang mgon po bkra shis], Jag&#xF6;tsang Namgyal Dorje [Tib. bya rgod tshang rnam rgyal rdo rje] and Sandu Lonyendra [Tib. sa &#x2018;du blo snyan grags]. They were the main ones who launched the Lhasa revolt. At that time, Surkhang, Shasur [Tib. bshad zur], Phala Dr&#xF6;nyerchemmo, et cetera, were saying that this was the chance to take the Dalai Lama abroad, and if we launched the revolt and fired many guns, the Chinese PLA would not have any choice but to fire back. They purposely launched the revolt. At that time, we had a discipline [rule] from the Central Committee (Zhongyang) and the Military Command Area saying that we were not allowed to fire the first shot [Ch. bu xu da di yi qiang] [Tib. me mda&#x2019; ang dang po rgyag chog gi ma red]. &quot;If they fire, let them do it, and we must propagandize [Tib. dril; bsgrags] [Ch. xuan chuan] to them. Do not get deceived [Ch. bu yiao shang dang] [Tib. mgo &#x2018;khor ma thebs pa byed].&quot; Like this, they fired a lot of guns and launched the revolt. The main reason for launching the revolt was the matter of when the Dalai Lama was to go to the Military Command Area to watch the show. The performers of the Dance Group [Ch. wen gong tuan] of the Military Command Area were very skillful in singing and dancing Tibetan songs and dances. Every year, they had to go several times to do the performances in Norbulinga, and when the Dalai Lama wanted to watch the show, the Dance Group would go there right away. The Tibetan miser were saying that they were better than the Tibetans [Tib. bod pa phar bzhag], and that the dances and songs were so good. The Dance Group of the Military Command Area was really performing well and the Dalai Lama liked it very much. It was in February of 1959, which was on the 29th of 12th month in the Tibetan Earth-Dog Year, when they performed the opera [religious dance] on Tsegutor, at the east side of the Potala, in Deyangshar, where the Dalai Lama invited the leaders of the Military Command Area and [where they] watched the show together, as they would do every year. On that day, the Vice Commander, Deng Shaodong, went there as the leader of the Military Command Area, and [so did] Guo Xilian, the General Secretary [Tib. mi shu zhang] of the Tibet Work Committee [Ch. xi zang gong wei]. Did you ever meet the two of them?   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  No. Is Guo Xilian a female?   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  Guo Xilian was the General Secretary [Ch. mi shu zhang] and later became the Vice Party Secretary [Ch. fu shu ji] of the Tibet Work Committee. The Dalai Lama was with them when watching the show and the Dalai Lama told Deng Shaodong in person, &#x201C;I heard that the Dance Group [Tib. wen gong tuan] of the Military Command Area has studied and performed some new shows in China. So I thought of watching it [Tib. nga cig lta dgos bsam byung.]&#x201D; Deng Shaodong replied, &#x201C;If the Dalai Lama wants to watch, we can make preparations right away and send them to Norbulinga.&quot; The Dalai Lama said, &#x201C;This time, how about not coming to Norbulinga [Tib. da res nor bu gling ga la ma phyin na]? It would be good to perform it in your newly built hall [Ch. da li thang] where they have good lights and stages and everything.&#x201D; This hall was built in 1958. The Dalai Lama and Deng Shaodong had that talk directly [face to face]. After the opera, Deng Shaodong came back to the Military Command Area and he told all of the Kal&#xF6;n, &#x201C;The Dalai Lama himself told me that he will come to the Military Command Area to watch the show.&#x201D; And all of the Kal&#xF6;n, like Surkhang, Shasur, Liushar and Phala Dr&#xF6;nyerchemmo already knew about it, but they took a chance by outwardly telling the miser that the Dalai Lama going to the Military Command Area was a plot [Tib. lkog g.yo ngan byus]. There was no custom that the Dalai Lama would go to the Military Command Area. In the past, all the shows were performed in Norbulinga and this time, if he went to the Military Command Area, the Chinese would take him to China in a helicopter [Ch. zhi sheng fei ji]. There was no helicopter, but they made up this bad talk and told this lie. Another lie was that they said that when the Military Command Area would have the banquet, they would poison the Dalai Lama and our Dalai Lama would die, and there would be danger that Dalai Lama would die. Therefore, all people must stop him from going to the Military Command Area. As for the time, the Dalai Lama said that they [the Chinese] must confirm the date by talking with Jigyab Khembo Gadrang [Tib. dga&#x2019; brang]. Do you know him?   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  Yes.   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong> I have met Gadrang many times. This was the time when the Dalai Lama was taking the exam for the Lharamba Geshe [Tib. lha rams dge bshes]. So he said that after taking the Lharamba Geshe exam, he would go to the Military Command Area. Later, Li Zuoming talked with Gadrang. Li Zuoming is still in the Zhongyang United Front Bureau [Ch. tong zhan bu], and the date was fixed [set] for March 10th. On March 9th, G&#xF6;shampa [Tib. rgod gsham pa], who is a good person, told Ngab&#xF6;, &#x201C;Surkhang, Shasur, Liushar and Phala are putting forward a plan to stop the Dalai Lama from going to the Military Command Area by making up talk [Tib. skad cha], and making the miser rise up along with Chushigandru, by [saying that] we must stop the Dalai Lama by surrounding Norbulinga and we should not let him go to the Military Command Area.&quot; On the night of March 9th, there was such talk in Lhasa. At that time, sometimes I was wearing a military uniform and sometimes I was wearing civilian clothes [Ch. bian yi]. There were several teams keeping abreast [Ch. zhang wuo] of the situation. One was the East Side team and the other was the West Side team, and I was keeping abreast of the situation in the urban area, like in the Barkor and Lubu [Tib. klu sbug] [areas]. At that time, I heard this talk. The one who made this talk was the Nangtsesha Mayor [Tib. mi dpon] of Lhasa.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  You heard these things from the people, right?  </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  Yes, the people had great faith toward the Dalai Lama, so when they heard about the Chinese taking the Dalai Lama to China and killing him, they were shocked [Tib. &#x2018;drog &#x2018;go langs]. They didn&#x2019;t know the real situation and they heard those lies. During the morning of March 10th, there were 2,000-3,000 people who went to Norbulinga and surrounded it. Therefore, the Dalai Lama didn&#x2019;t have freedom and couldn&#x2019;t come outside of Norbulinga. Like this, they launched a very disturbing [Tib. zang ngi zang ngi] revolt and held the demonstration.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  At that time, were you in the Tibet Military Command Area?  </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  Sometimes I was in the regiment and sometimes I was in the Barkor, Lubu and [the area] at the bottom of the Potala. There were several people with me keeping abreast of the situation and reporting to the Tibet Military Command Area, and then they went back. I saw it myself when they killed Phagpalha Khenjung Sonam Gyatso [Tib. &#x2018;phags pa lha mkhan chung bsod nams rgya mtsho].   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  Wow!  </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  They killed him in Norbulinga by stoning him, saying he was working with the Chinese. After killing him, they tied his legs with a rope, and attached him to a horse and dragged his head on the floor. I saw this when they dragged him around the Barkor. It was very cruel [upsetting] to see all the blood on him and all people were scared. They were saying, &#x201C;Whoever goes along with the Chinese will have this final result. Tibet has gained total independence. The Chinese and the soldiers of the CCP must go back.&quot; They shouted a lot that Tibet is completely independent. Some of the miser were scared and some of them followed them, and the situation was chaotic. All the shops and the tea shops were closed, and there was a big revolt. They fired a few guns and canons toward the Tibet Military Command Area, but we didn&#x2019;t fire back against them at all. We just propagandized using the loudspeaker, saying, &#x201C;Don&#x2019;t get duped, these talks are lies. It was the Dalai Lama himself&apos;s desire to come to the Tibet Military Command Area.&#x201D; Not only did I myself see this situation, [but] there were some good kudrak, like Langd&#xFC;n Pema [Tib. glang mdun pad ma], [who] was also with us propagandizing. Sh&#xF6;lkang Thubden Nyima [Tib. zhol khang thub bstan nyi ma] was also good and he also spoke through the loudspeaker.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  Where did you place the loudspeaker?  </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  We placed one on the main gate of the Tibet Military Command Area and also on the roof top. The sound was very loud. At that time, the Dalai Lama didn&#x2019;t have freedom.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  Did you propagandize once or did you continuously do that?  </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  We spoke continuously and we went out to detect [get a feel of] the situation, and then came back and spoke again. And after 1-2 hours, we went out again.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  Did you talk with the leaders [Tib. dpon po] when you came back?   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  Yes. I made a report to the director of the Intelligence Department. I was doing both the propagandizing and reconnoitering [Tib. so lta nyul zhib dang dril bsgrags] at the same time. When they stopped the Dalai Lama on the morning of March 10th and he couldn&#x2019;t come to the Tibet Military Command Area, the Dance Group was making preparations, like doing their makeup and the reception work, like preparing fruits, sweets and the chairs for the Dalai Lama to sit [on]. The Political Commissar, Tan Guansan, led the preparation work in person. At that time, Zhang Jingwu and Zhang Guohua were not there because they were sick and they had taken sick leave in China. So the main one [in charge] was Tan Guansan. Chairman Mao was in Wuhan. Tan Guansan came back at noon and he was very much worried. We were all worried very much because the situation was in chaos, and Phagpalha Khenjung had been killed and Sambo Tsewang Rinzin [Tib. bsam pho tshe dbang rig &#x2018;dzin] was almost killed. They mistook him as Ngab&#xF6;, who was then the Vice Commander of the Tibet Military Command Area, who was driven in a small car, and Chushigandru stoned him. He was injured and had to be hospitalized. In the afternoon, around 2-3:00 p.m., Surkhang, Liushar and Shasur, the three Kal&#xF6;ns, came to the Tibet Military Command Area and met the Political Commissar, Tan Guansan. Surkhang said, &#x201C;The miser don&#x2019;t agree [Tib. mos po mi &#x2018;dug], so the Dalai Lama cannot come to the Tibet Military Command Area.&#x201D; Then Liushar said, &#x201C;We didn&#x2019;t know about the matter that the Dalai Lama [was] coming to the Tibet Military Command [Area].&#x201D; Right away, the Political Commissar, Tan Guansan, refuted [Tib. dgag pa brgyab] him saying, &#x201C;It was confirmed by the Dalai Lama himself to come to the Tibet Military Command Area, and Gadrang was to fix the time. And he reported to the Dalai Lama and he prepared, and we also made preparations. All of you know about this because Vice Commander Deng Shaodong told all of you. But now Liushar is saying that he didn&#x2019;t know about this. Don&#x2019;t the two of you also know about this?&#x201D; He asked the two other Kal&#xF6;ns. They didn&#x2019;t have any answer to give because it was a lie and they didn&#x2019;t know how to answer. So Tan Guansan said, &#x201C;Today&#x2019;s revolt was an evil plot [Tib. lkog g.yo ngan byus] and it was planned from the early times. This was not an ordinary thing, so you must severely punish the murderer of Phagpalha and the ones who wounded Sambo, and ensure that such things will never happen again. Now the Dalai Lama didn&#x2019;t have the freedom to watch a show. What kind of work are you the Kashag doing?&#x201D; He spoke [in a] serious [manner]. I was there when Tan Guansan said that, and they [the Tibetans] were embarrassed and didn&#x2019;t have much to say. So they just said &#x201C;Yes, yes [Tib. lags so lags so],&quot; and left for Norbulinga. After they left, they didn&#x2019;t meet Tan Guansan again. Zhongyang knew all about this, and they were saying that in order to win over [Tib. brtson len] the Dalai Lama and avoid danger, as you know, Tan Guansan sent three letters to the Dalai Lama, and the Dalai Lama also replied to the letters.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  At that time, what kind of suggestions [Tib. bsam &#x2018;char] did Zhongyang give you people?   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  They [Tibetans] were saying that if they made a terrific effort to take the Dalai Lama out [of Tibet] [Tib. u tshugs byas nas gdan &#x2018;dren zhu], then the US would support them. They made this kind of plan. Zhang Jingwu said that the Dalai Lama was at a loss and didn&#x2019;t know what to do [Ch. na bu ding zhu yi]. [He said] That the Dalai Lama was not very bad, but he was uncertain [Tib. gtan gtan yod ma red], and since he is a Bodhisattva, in order to have Buddhism flourish, he had to make good relations with all people. So he had good relations with Ngab&#xF6;, Surkhang, the PLA and also Chushigandru, and he didn&#x2019;t want to harm anyone and wanted to be friendly. This was an empty hope. From the early times, Zhang Jingwu came to know this fault of the Dalai Lama, namely, that regarding politics, he didn&#x2019;t have a main position[Ch. zhu xin gu] and a firm idea [Ch. jian ding de zhu yi].   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  I mean, what instructions did the Zhongyang send; what instructions did you receive in Lhasa?  </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  We received the instruction that we must continuously win over [Ch. zheng qu] [Tib. brtson len] the Dalai Lama. It was possible that they would abduct him [Ch. jie chi]. Chairman Mao said, &#x201C;If we cannot win over the Dalai Lama and if he were to go out, do not stop him [Ch. bu yao zu dang] [Tib. bkag rgyu yod ma red].&quot;   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  Did he say that before the revolt or after the revolt was launched?   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  It was after the revolt took place on the 10th. On the 12th, Chairman Mao gave this instruction from Wuhan. He said, &#x201C;If the Dalai Lama goes abroad, do not stop him. There are two main reasons not to stop him. One is in terms of politics because he is the Vice Chairman [Tib. u yon zhang gzhon pa] of the National People&#x2019;s Congress [Tib. rgyal yongs mi dmangs &#x2018;thus mi tshogs chen] and a leader of the state. It is not good to stop him and it would not be good internationally that he didn&#x2019;t have the freedom to go abroad.&quot; Basically, this would have an influence on his freedom. This was the political consideration. And there was a military consideration that if we stopped him with our soldiers, the Dalai Lama had his Gusung bodyguard troops, and the Trapchi soldiers and Chushigandru so altogether there were about 200-300 people and if about 200-300 PLA stopped them, they would exchange fire. If ordinary people got killed it would be a little better, but if the Dalai Lama got hit, then it would be very dangerous and it would not be good at all [Tib. rtsa ba nas yag po yod ma red] because the guns don&#x2019;t have eyes. So these were instructions given by the Chairman Mao in person. This was an internal talk and [was] not public before, but today I can tell you. At that time, actually, we could have stopped him, and it was not the case that we could not stop him because we had an air force paratroopers battalion [Ch. kong jiang ying], who could be parachuted [in] and stop him in Lhoka. We also had that plan, but Zhongyang didn&#x2019;t approve it. The Dalai Lama himself didn&#x2019;t want to have riots [Ch. sao luan]. He wanted to watch the show, and he opposed the revolt and the Chushigandru people who surrounded Norbulinga, and he didn&#x2019;t have freedom. The one who first delivered Tan Guansan&#x2019;s letter to the Dalai Lama was Gyamtsoling [Tib. rgya mtsho gling] Tr&#xFC;lku, who was then the debate partner [Tib. tshan zhabs] to the Dalai Lama. Gyamtsoling was one of the three personal attendants of the Dalai Lama wsho were in charge of food, clothing and offerings [Tib. gsol gzim mchod gsum]. [Translator Note: Gyamtsoling was not the [Tib. mchod dpon mkhan po]]. I met Gyamtsoling many times and I asked him about this in 1961. He said that he went to Norbulinga and delivered Tan Guansan&#x2019;s letter, and found that the Dalai Lama showed an angry face [Tib. gdong nag po], and was distressed [Ch. you shang], very unhappy and lost his appetite. The Dalai Lama called the Kal&#xF6;ns and scolded them [Tib. gshe gshe] saying, &#x201C;Don&#x2019;t I even have the freedom to watch the show?&#x201D; The Dalai Lama criticized [Tib. skyon rjod] the Kal&#xF6;ns saying, &#x201C;You should not do this. You are not allowed to launch the revolt in Norbulinga.&quot; Now, there are all of these records [Tib. yi ge]. Zhongyang had been thinking that it was the Dalai Lama&#x2019;s idea to hold the meetings in Norbulinga and oppose the Zhongyang, but the Dalai Lama said, &#x201C;I don&#x2019;t want to do this. This is done by the Chushigandru and you should not do this. If you insist on holding the meetings, you should not hold them in Norbulinga. You must hold them outside.&#x201D; Like this, the Dalai Lama scolded them and then, in reality, they didn&#x2019;t hold the meeting in Norbulinga and moved it outside to the printing house in Sh&#xF6;lkang [Tib. zhol par khang], that was located at the foot of the Potala. I have also been in that printing house many times.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  Did the high ranking Zhongyang officials underneath give the instructions that it would not be good internationally to stop the Dalai Lama, or did Chairman Mao himself gave the instruction?   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  Chairman Mao himself gave the instruction. Do you have Mao Zedong&#x2019;s Select Works in Tibet [Ch. mao ze dong xi zang gong zuo wen xuan]?&quot;   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  Yes, I have that. Are these written in that book?   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  Yes, it is written there, &#x201C;Do not stop [him]. Let him go [Ch. bu yao zu dang/ rang ta zou].&quot; They moved to the printing house in Sh&#xF6;l on March 12th and most of the dewashung kudrak (Tibetan Governmnet officials) attended the meeting. Some of the better kudrak, like Sh&#xF6;lkang Thubden Nyima, Ts&#xF6;go [Tib. mtsho sgo], Langd&#xFC;n and Phagpalha, who were in the Military Command Area and in the PCTAR [Tib. rang skyong ljong gra sgrig u yon lhan khang], moved into our offices. There were instructions from Zhongyang saying, &#x201C;For safety, let the patriotic personal move in [Ch. wei le an quan rang ai guo ren shi ban jin lai].&quot; So there were about 500-600 people who moved in. However, the majority went to Norbulinga to attend the meeting, and among these, there were double-headed [two-faced] [people] like Kapsh&#xF6;ba [laughter].  </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong> Was that the old Kapsh&#xF6;ba?   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  Yes, it was Kapsh&#xF6;ba, Ch&#xF6;gyal Nyima [Tib. chos rgyal nyi ma], who had been the Kal&#xF6;n in the past, and was later banished and then became a Teiji. I have met him many times, and after the liberation, he came to see Lijun, and I was the interpreter. Kapsh&#xF6;ba neither went to Norbulinga nor to the Military Command Area; he stayed home. I later heard that he asked his servants, &#x201C;If the Chushigandru and Tibetan soldiers come to call me to attend the meeting in Norbulinga, tell them I am not at home and I have already left for Norbulinga. If the PLA come to invite me to [join] their regiment, tell them that I went to Ngab&#xF6;.&#x201D; [Laughter] Actually, he stayed home and didn&#x2019;t go anywhere.  </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  I have never heard this.  </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  He was a two-faced person. So he was not involved in the revolt, and after the revolt he was among the ones who got the buyout policy [Tib. blu nyo&#x2019;i srid jus] [compensation policy] implemented. The ones involved in the revolt had their property confiscated and distributed to the farmers. And later he also became the committee member of the Political Consultative Conference [Tib. chab srid gros tshogs kyi u yon]. In 1960, when they held the meeting of the Political Consultative Conference, Tan Guansan was the chairman of the Political Consultative Conference and Ts&#xF6;go was the vice chairman. Janglojen [Tib. lcang lo can] was good and he was also in the Military Command Area. [T.N. Note: At that time, it was widely known in Lhasa that Kapsh&#xF6;ba had attended some meetings in Norbulinga after March 10th, [and] he was indeed at home until the war started. However, as soon as he heard the first cannon shot, he asked his servants, &#x201C;If the Khambas come, tell them I went to Norbulinga, and if the PLA comes, tell them I went to [see] Ngab&#xF6;.&#x201D; Actually, he sat on the backseat of his motor cycle driven by his servant, and went to [see] Ngab&#xF6; and knocked on the gate saying, &#x201C;Now, my house is full of Khambas, so please save my life.&#x201D; Then Ngab&#xF6; called the Military Command Area and asked, &#x201C;Now, Kapsh&#xF6;ba has come to my house to surrender, shall I accept him?&quot; And the Military Command Area told Ngab&#xF6; to accept him. That&#x2019;s how he became a progressive [Tib. yar thon].} When the meeting of the Political Consultative Conference was held, Tan Guansan told Kapsh&#xF6;ba, &#x201C;You must study well and transform yourself well. As for your label for the revolt, I can label you, if I want to [Tib. zing &#x2019;khrug gi zhwa mo de g.yogs chog chog yod red].&quot; [Laughter] Kapsh&#xF6;ba was called a &#x201C;two-faced drum [Tib. da ru mgo].&quot; When Reting [Tib. rwa sgreng] was demoted, Kapsh&#xF6;ba was Kal&#xF6;n and he wrote two letters on two message writing boards [Tib. sam khra], and sent one to Reting saying that he would serve him and sent one to Taktra saying that he would stand on Taktra&apos;s side. The servant mistakenly delivered the writing boards [laughter]. This was the reason why Kapsh&#xF6;ba was banished. At that time, in general, people didn&#x2019;t know whether the PLA would win or if the Chushigandru would win the victory because there was a small number of PLA then and Chushigandru had about 6,000-7,000 soldiers. The Military Command Area Combat Troops [Ch. zuo zhan bu dui] had only two regiments with a little more than 1,300 infantry soldiers and all the others were cadres in the offices.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  The canon regiment was not included in 1,300, right?   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  Yes. They [Tibetans] didn&#x2019;t know much about the strength of the canon regiment.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  How many canons did they have then?   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  There were three canon battalions. One was the Jianong Canon Battalion [Tib. jia nong pao ying], which was flat fire [Ch. pin she], and the Liudan Canon Battalion [Ch. liu dan pao ying], which was curved fire [Ch. qu she] that shot behind the mountain [Ch. shan bei hou], and one was the heavy mortar battalion [Ch. zhong paiji pao ying]. [Translator Note: Jianong is the Chinese pronunciation of canon, for example, Canada is pronounced as Jianada. I found this in the dictionary written [Ch. jia nong pao] = canon. Liudan might also be an English word pronounced in Chinese, but I can&#x2019;t find it in the dictionary.]   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  The canon regiments were in Trip, on the south side of the river, right?   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  Yes, they were in Trip [Tib. grib], so they were not very attentive to them and their reconnoitering situation [Tib. zhen cha; ch. qing kuang] was also very poor. So they didn&#x2019;t know the situation and the situation was chaotic, and their military standard was very low. We were very skillful militarily and we had rich experience. At that time, they bullied our soldiers very much, which made us very angry, and were saying that we must fight. The soldiers were itching to fight [Ch. qiu zhan qing xu hen gao], but the Zhongyang Military Committee [Ch. jun wei] and the Military Command Area were saying, &quot;You are not allowed to fight [Ch. bu xu da].&quot; Why were we not allowed to fight? The first [reason] was that if we fought, we didn&#x2019;t know whether we would win [or not] because the number of our people was much less and they had many people, and also because the miser (populace) also were coming towards to them.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  You said there were several thousand people. Those were miser, right?   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  Yes.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  How many Khambas and Tibetan soldiers were there?   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  There were 4 regiments [in the Tibetan army]. The Gusung (Bodyguard) Regiment, which was the Kadang Regiment located in Norbulinga, and [it] had about 600-700 soldiers. Its dep&#xF6;n was Yabshi Ph&#xFC;ntso Tashi [Tib. yab gzhis phin tshogs bkra shis], who was related to the Dalai Lama [his brother-in-law]. The Khadang Regiment was the Trapchi Regiment. It was located in the north (of Lhasa), and had 1,000 soldiers in the past, but at that time, there were only 600-700 soldiers because about 100-200 soldiers went over to Chushigandru in Lhoka carrying their guns. The fourth regiment, the Ngadang Regiment, was called the Gyantse Regiment, and at that time, it was located in the place called &#x201C;Stone Lion [Tib. rdo seng ge],&quot; just near to the Military Command Area; they had about 400 soldiers. And they also had the Canon Regiment, which was the Chadang Regiment. The dep&#xF6;n of the Ngadang Regiment was Ragashag [Tib. rags kha shag], or Dokharsey [Tib. mdo mkhar sras]. I have seen him many times. His father was a nice person [who] died in 1957 when the Dalai Lama came back (from India). If he hadn&#x2019;t died, he wouldn&#x2019;t have been involved in the revolt. He was a stable person, almost like Ngab&#xF6;. However, his son was quite bad like Surkhang, and he was the dep&#xF6;n of the Ngadang Regiment. The dep&#xF6;n of the Chadang Regiment was J&#xFC;npa [Tib. &#x2018;jun pa]. The Chadang Regiment was from Dingri and the Jadang Regiment was from Shigatse. The dep&#xF6;n of the Chadang Regiment was Numa Rimshi, who was a nice person. The dep&#xF6;n of the Jadang [Tib. ca dang] Regiment in Dingri was Dragjun [Tib. brag &#x2018;jun]. Altogether, there 3,000-4,000 Tibetan soldiers, and they had about 2,000 in Lhasa.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  From among the 2,000 soldiers, didn&#x2019;t most of them go to India when the Dalai Lama went there?   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  No, most of them didn&#x2019;t go. When they made war in Lhasa, we arrested most of them. Part of the Gusung and Trapchi soldiers went with the Chushigandru and then went to India. The Tibetan soldiers did many disturbing things [Tib. za ngi zing ngi] and fired guns, and the Tibetan kudrak stood on their side. So the kudrak who were acting nice [Tib. yag po byed mkhan] to us were afraid, thinking that if they cooperated [Tib. mnyam po byas na] with the Chinese, it would be like [what happened with] Phagpalha Khenjung and [they] would be killed. At that time, people didn&#x2019;t know whether the PLA would win or [if] the Chushigandru will win. Therefore, most of the people went to Norbulinga to attend the meeting and signed their names, and [they] said, &quot;From today [on], we will not cooperate with the Chinese and we will stand on your side.&quot; Later, we got all of these documents written [about] who was involved [in the revolt]. They couldn&#x2019;t take that over [the Transportation Station?], so they fired guns. On the 16th, they mainly fired guns toward the Military Command Area, and among the local offices, they fired against the Qinghai-Tibet Highway Transportation Station [Tib. mtsho bod mo tra&#x2019;i &#x2018;gro lam lha sa&#x2019;i &#x2018;grim &#x2018;grul las khungs; Ch. qing zang gong lu yun shu zhan] located on the west side of Lhasa, in between Norbulinga and the Potala, where there were many of our militia who didn&#x2019;t wear military uniforms, but were given guns and machine guns [Ch. ji guan qiang] because the situation was tense. There were many discharged soldiers [Ch. fu yuan jun ren] in the Transportation Station.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong> What do you mean by many? Were there like a thousand?   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  There were 2,000-3000 of them, and their duty was self-defense [Ch. zi wei] and to guard [Ch. fang shou] one&#x2019;s own unit, but they could not go on the offensive [Tib. phar rgol byed thub kyi ma red]. Among them, there was one policeman named Zeng Huishan, who was an economic policeman [Ch. jingji jingcha], who violated the law [Tib. khrims &#x2018;gal]. On the 16th and 17th of March, Chushigandru fired a great many shots, and there was the danger that the gasoline pipe in the Transportation Station would catch fire. They [Tibetans] fired tens and hundreds [Tib. bcu phrag brgya phrag] of shots from the Potala. Therefore, he was angry and violated the law of not firing against them, and he fired two shells from the small mortar called 60 Paiji Pao against Norbulinga.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  Was this on the 16th?   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  It was at 2-3 p.m. on the 17th.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  Did he just fired casually [Tib. da ga se] by himself?   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  Yes. This was against our discipline because the Tibet Military Command Area said it was not allowed for us to fire first, but he fired. These two canon shells didn&#x2019;t reach inside Norbulinga and fell outside Norbulinga at the distance of about 100 feet. Then Surkhang, Shasur, Liushar and Phala said, &#x201C;Now, the Chinese have fired the canon against Norbulinga, so there is danger to the Dalai Lama,&quot; and they insisted that the Dalai Lama leave on the 17th.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong> Now, they got the chance, right?   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong> Yes.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  What is the name of the person who fired the canon?   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  His name is Zeng Huishan. You can find this in the book titled, &#x201C;Chinese Communist Party, 55 years of records of big events on the work in Tibet [Ch. zhong guo gong chan dang wu shi wu nyan xi zang gong zuo da shi ji].&quot;   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  What was the third canon battalion you mentioned?   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  In our 308th Regiment, located in Trip, they had the infantry regiment and also the canon regiment, and the third canon regiment was the 120th Heavy Mortar Battalion [Tib. zhong pai ji pao ying]. The 60 mortar [Ch. liu ling pai ji pao] is the smallest and the 82 mortar [Tib. ba er pai ji pao] is the middle size.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  Is this the name of the book?   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  Yes. In this book, the events of March 17th and the name of Zeng Huishan were written, and later he was punished [Ch. shou chu fen] for his wrongdoing. What he did matched Surkhang, Liushar, Shasur and Phala&#x2019;s plan [Ch. zheng zhong liao ta men de ji hua], which was to &#x201C;provoke and provoke again, and then you have to attack them, and when you attack, then I take the Dalai [Lama] away [Ch. tiao xin tiao xin de shi hou ni yao gong ji/ zhi yao ni gong ji wo ba da lai dai zou].&quot;   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong> [Looking at a book] What was he doing here?   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  {another Chinese said] This is talking about his job and the name of his position, and what he was doing and [how] his responsibility was to fire the mortars.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  Where was he stationed at that time?  </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  I don&#x2019;t know where he is now. He&apos;s probably dead.  </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong> No, I mean where was he stationed at that time?   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  He was stationed at the West Side Transportation Station, located in the northeast of Norbulinga and near the Lhasa Middle School. Even now, the station is still there, but it has been developed very much.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong> Why did Zeng Huishan got angry and fire the mortar?   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong> This Transportation Station was at a very crucial point, like a throat to go from Norbulinga to the town, and Chushigandru wanted to wipe it out because the rebels had to pass by this Transportation Station, as it would not be convenient for them to move [Ch. xing dong bu fang bian]. So they fired many guns and canons at this station. So it would be too bad if the gasoline pipe caught fire. Therefore, he got angry and went against the discipline [Ch. wei fan ji lu] and counter-attacked [Tib. fan ji] even though the Military Command Area said not to counterattack. Though these two shells didn&#x2019;t reach Norbulinga, Surkhang and Phala said that the Dalai Lama must leave, and on that night he left. When he [Dalai Lama] left, he was not well prepared, and his mother and sister were also not well prepared, but he had to leave all of a sudden. The Dalai Lama even left his quilt, which is still there now, and he didn&#x2019;t take his things, and didn&#x2019;t have much money also. However, Surkhang, Liushar, Shasur and Phala were well prepared and loaded all of their valuable things, like gold and silver, on horses and mules. At that time, the Dalai Lama&#x2019;s mother and Yabshi Tsering Drolma [Tib. yab gzhis tshe ring sgrol ma] [his sister] were not well prepared and had to leave all of a sudden. When they crossed the Lhasa River at the Ramagang ferry site, Yabshi Tsering Drolma didn&#x2019;t have a horse to ride, so they brought an inferior horse from the miser which didn&#x2019;t have proper saddlery, and they went to Lhoka in a chaotic manner. At that time, the Indian Consul General [Ch. zong ling shi guan] was Mr. Kiper. I saw him many times. He used to be the Indian Commercial Representative [Ch. shang wu dai biao] in Yadong. I saw him many times. He was a little fat. Later he was appointed as the Consul General in Lhasa. He received those rebels and helped them send several telegraphs to Shakabpa and those people in India, saying a disturbance broke out in Lhasa and war might ensue. But, we received [intercepted] the telegraph sent that night.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  Did they receive that by accident or what?   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong> In that telegraph, it said, &#x201C;That man already left Norbulinga [Ch. na ge ren yi jing zou le] [Tib. mi de norbu gling ga nas thon song].&quot; So we analyzed [Ch. fen xi] it and speculated that the Dalai Lama had left.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  How did the PLA get the telegraph?   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  We could get that message from our telegraph station [Ch. dian tai] because it was a plain code [Tib. ming ma dian bao] telegraph and not a secret code telegraph [Ch. mi ma dian bao]. But in the telegraph, they did not say the Dalai Lama, but only said, that person.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong> At around what time did you get that telegraph?   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong> It was around 12 p.m-1 a.m.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong> What time did the Dalai Lama leave?   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  He might have left at 11 or 12, and then they sent this telegraph. When they sent that telegraph, only a few people knew about that and Lhalu [Tib. lha klu] didn&#x2019;t know. At that time, we also invited Lhalu to the regiment. Lhalu had been a Kal&#xF6;n and then was an ex-Kal&#xF6;n [Tib. bka&#x2019; zur]. Lhalu had done quite a lot of good things. [Another Chinese person] You have talked for about an hour.   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong> Is it useful what I have told you?   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong> It is very useful. How can you remember these things, because many years have passed? You have a very amazing memory.   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong> I wrote these details in my book. Did you read that book?   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  Yes, I did.   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  These are written in my book titled, &#x201C;The Historical Status of Tibet [Ch. xi zang li shi di wei bian] [Tib. bod ljongs kyi lo rgyus go bab dpyad zhib].&quot; This is the fourth edition. It was published in 1995 by the Ethnic Publishing House [Ch. min zu chu ban she], and you can still buy it.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  I can ask a Chinese student and she can buy it.  </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  I spent 4 years from 1991-1995 writing this book, which has about 600,000 characters, and I got a prize for that. [Other Chinese person translates from Chinese:] Mr. Wang asked why you wanted to ask for these, since these all are written in the book. So I told Mr. Wang that Dr. Goldstein can read what you have written in the book, but he wants you to talk about that. [Wang Gui:] He is right. one&#x2019;s personal experiences is of much more influence than reading the book. [The other Chinese person tells Wang:] Yes, for example, you were talking about you being beaten and tied up. We can&#x2019;t see these in the book. [Wang Gui:] It was really cruel, and my head was broken and bleeding [Ch. tou po xue liu].   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  In that book, did you write about 1959?  </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong> Yes, I wrote all of it.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong> When you got that telegraph, you suspected that he [Dalai Lama] left. Then what did you do?   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  I need to tell you a little bit about the war (fighting). After the Dalai Lama left, the Military Command Area and the Tibet Work Committee did ane investigation [Tib. zhib &#x2018;jug] and said that now, perhaps [Tib. phal cher] we should fight the battle because there was no choice but to fight [Tib. dmag ma rgyag rang rgyag red]. In that case, if we fought the battle, there was some danger for us because we had a small number of people and their [Tibetan] number of people was increasing. After the Kashag launched the revolt, they sent an edict, and the main content was to recruit people from age 18-60 [Tib. bco brgyad drug cu] and tell them that they must fight against the Chinese. They sent this edict mainly to the dzongs and estates under the Sh&#xF6;l legung, like Lhasa, Metrogongkar [Tib. mal gro gung dkar] and to Chushul [Tib. chu shur]. So our Intelligence Team [Ch. qing bao zu] got this information. The miser didn&#x2019;t know about the situation and they had deep faith in the Dalai Lama. And when they heard that the Dalai Lama would be taken to China, poisoned and killed, naturally [Tib. rang bzhin gyis], they were coming over, bringing their food, guns, swords and spears. Every day, there were about 200-300-400 and the numbers increased.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong> They were coming to Norbulinga, right?   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong> They were coming to Lhasa. There were also monk soldiers [Tib. ser dmag] from the three great monastic seats of Sera, Drepung and Ganden coming. At that time, among the rebellion troops, there were more and more masses coming who were duped and under duress [Ch. guo xie]. At that time, the chairman of the Zhongyang Military Committee was Peng Dehuai and the Chief of Staff was Senior General [Ch. da jiang] Huang Kecheng, and their order was to wait and to hold fast to [one&#x2019;s position] [Ch. jian shou], and not to counter attack for half a month or a month. That we should wait, and make preparations, such as storing up [Ch. tun] on grain and water, and building bunkers. Get well prepared to hold fast to [one&#x2019;s position] and be firmly entrenched in [Ch. zuo hao jian shou gu shou de zhun bei], and wait for the two divisions coming later [reinforcements] to destroy the rebels. Tan Guansan was determined to put this command into action. However, the subordinate officers and soldiers like me were eager [Ch. ji zhe] to fight, and we were saying, &#x201C;We must fight. If we don&#x2019;t fight, there is danger. On the one hand, we won&#x2019;t be able to handle them because their number is increasing. On the other hand, if we fight too late, more and more masses who are duped and under duress [who have] joined the rebellion will be mistakenly injured [Ch. wu shang].&quot; At that time, Tan Guansan kept very silent and he knew what to do. And there were three work units that were under the greatest danger. The first was the Qinghai-Tibet Road Transportation Station, which was attacked, but we fought back courageously and defeated [Ch. yiong gan da thui] them.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong> Where was the Transportation Station located going from Jokpori [Tib. lcags po ri]?   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong> It was located between Jokpori and Norbulinga, slightly in the north, and in between there was the big sandy river [Ch. liu sha he] [Tib. bye rag]. Now this river has been filled and reclaimed. The second was the Lhasa Middle School, which was attacked and they got inside.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong> What and who were there in the Lhasa Middle School?   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  The principal&#x2019;s surname was Lu. I forgot his name. [Other person] Was he Lu Huihan? [Wang Gui:] No, his surname was Lu. He is probably dead now. The third was the Lhasa Construction Brigade [Ch. jian she gong cheng dui], located near the Foreign Office [Tib. phyi rgyal las khungs] held in the Somph&#xFC; [Tib. zom phud] House and the Tibet Daily Newspaper Office. This was also near to Ramoche.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong> You don&#x2019;t remember which unit was in the Lhasa Middle School? What was there? Were there troops there?   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong> There were no troops. They were all militia organized by the teachers. The middle school was attacked and broken into. The Lhasa Construction Brigade fought very courageously, where even the female comrades also joined the fight. So they [rebels] attacked the Lhasa Construction Brigade, but they were stopped outside and couldn&#x2019;t enter it. At that time, the People&#x2019;s Hospital and the Tibet Daily Newspaper Office got attacked as well. But those three I mentioned were under the greatest danger.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong> This was on the 17th or the 18th?   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong> This was on the night of 19th. At midnight of the 19th, a meeting was held in the Tibet Military Command Area. There were only two regiments in Lhasa, the 155th Regiment and the 159th Regiment, who attended. The Political Commissar of the 155th regiment was Qiao Xueting and the Regimental Commander [Ch. tuan zhang] of the 159th Regiment was Guo Zhixian, and the Political Commissar of the 308th Canon Regiment located in Trip was Song Shengxiang. These main leaders of the regiments attended the meeting. And there was also the headquarters of the Military Command Area, the director of the Logistical Department [Ch. hou qing chu] of the Tibet Military Command Area, the director of the Intelligence Department and the director of the Combat Department [Ch. zuo zhan chu] who also attended the meeting. They held the meeting from midnight until morning. They discussed the situation and the general idea was to fight and that it was not okay not to fight [Ch. bu da bu zing]. We were waiting for the two divisions to come from Qinghai Province, especially the 134th Division led by Ding Sheng. Ding Sheng was actually the Army Commander [Ch. jun zhang]. The Division Commander [Ch. shi zhang] was someone with the surname of Bai, and the Political Commissar was called Lan Yilong. Another week had to pass before the two divisions arrived. At that time, there were mainly three leaders of the Military Command Area. The first was Political Commissar Tan [Guansan], the second was Vice Commander Deng Shaodong, and third was the Vice Political Commissar Zhan Huayu. The three of them had a meeting and in the end, Tan Guansan made the decision, and said, &quot;The three leaders made up their minds, mainly based on one piece of intelligence provided by the Intelligence Department, that all men between the ages of 18 and 60 are to come [to Lhasa]. This is dangerous, for it means a great number of masses might be injured or killed [if they come]. So now it is time to attack. However, we could potentially hurt a great number of masses, whereas the main forces of the rebels already followed the Dalai Lama and went to Lhoka. As a result, if we fight, we cannot smash the main force.&quot; On that night, I didn&#x2019;t attend the meeting, but the leaders who attended the meeting told me that they discussed again and again, pacing around, and finally, Tan Guansan said, &#x201C;Let&#x2019;s attack! I will take responsibility for this [Ch. da ba/wo lai fu zhe ge ze ren].&quot;   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong> This meeting was held on the 20th, right?   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong> They held the meeting at 3-4 a.m. in the early morning of the 20th. They discussed for about half of the night, and later they made the decision. Then they decided the first target should be Jokpori, since it was one of the two commanding heights [Ch. zhigaodian] in Lhasa. The other one being the Potala, since [they are] the two mountains, Jokpori and the Potala, in Lhasa. Jokpori was the most dangerous because their artillery soldiers could attack our Military District from above. Thus, Jokpori must be attacked and taken first. So, the 308 canon regiment started to shell Jokpori.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong> Did the Tibetans have canons?   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong> Yes, the Chadang Regiment was the canon regiment and they had sent some canons to Jokpori. Tan Guansan sent a telegraph to the Zhongyang saying, &#x201C;It is not okay not to fight [Ch. bu da bu xing]. So we have decided to fight and I, Tan Guansan, will assume responsibility for all the results [Ch. yi qie hou guo wo tan guan san fu ze],&quot; and the two other leaders also said, &#x201C;Not only Tan Guansan, but also the two of us will take responsibility for all the results. We will also sign.&#x201D; Like this, the canon regiment made the preparation. At 10 a.m. on the 20th, The canon regiment started shelling Jokpori. The bombing lasted about 30 minutes, and after the bombing, only a few people there survived. The previous night, the 4th Company of the 159th Regiment...Guo Zhixian, the regiment commander of the 159th Regiment, said that we should not approach Jokpori during the daytime since the enemies were high above [and thus could attack us easily]. Instead, we should sneak there in the dark. Guo Zhixian was an old Red Army soldier, and an excellent commander, whose regiment was strong in combat. However, in order to do that, a tunnel [Ch. di dong] was needed. So the same night, one battalion dug a tunnel, which was about 800 meters long, starting from the TWC [Tibetan Work Committee] compound. On the one hand, they dug the tunnel, and on the other hand, they covered it with timbers and planks [Ch. mu ban]. The tunnel was about 1.4 or 1.5 meters deep and went throughout the tunnel to the foot of Jokpori. Around 7-8 a.m., the company [the 4th Company] got to the foot of Jokpori through the tunnel. [Other Chinese person: Was that 21st?] No, the 20th. At 7 or 8 a.m. on the 20th, they arrived at the base of Jokpori, and the bombing started at 10 a.m. After the bombing ended, they [the 4th Company] rushed uphill and got to the top in 20 minutes. The bombing lasted about 30 minutes, and then the soldiers went up and took Jokpori. At that time, in the Potala, they [Tibetans] also had quite a lot of machine guns and sand bags on the windows. They did some shooting from above. [For attacking the Potala], we used the regimental artillery force [Ch. uan shu pao bing], the artillery company of the 159th Regiment. The 308th canon force was an army artillery force [Ch. jun shu pao bing]. The regimental artillery force was based inside the military district. The regimental artillery force had measured the distance [Ch. ce liang], targeting the windows of the Potala Palace a long time ago. The artillery company had flat trajectory [Ch. ping she], middle range artillery. The shooting range of their weapons was about 800 to 900 meters. The had done the measurements a long time ago. They had an extremely beautiful battle [Ch. fei chang piao liang]. Tan Guansan said that we must strongly protect the ancient architectural places [Tib. gu jian], like the Potala, Norbulinga, and Jokhang. That we could only destroy the places from where they were firing machine-guns, but not to destroy the whole architecture. The canon forces had done the measurement very nicely, so when they shelled the Potala, like 15 times, they only destroyed the windows. You could see the dust rising, but the architecture of the Potala still remained undamaged. The rebels were terrified by this shelling and escaped. At this time, the Bodyguard Battalion [Ch. jing wei ying] of the Military Command Area led by the Battalion Commander Zhou Xiusan was very successful [Ch. hen de li] in attacking the Ngadang Regiment, and they eliminated it in less than an hour, although the dep&#xF6;n escaped.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong> Where was this regiment located?   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong> It was located at the Stone Lion, Dosenge. So like this, the Ngadang Regiment was destroyed. The military action was mainly commanded by Deng Shaodong. The Norbulinga headquarters was the next target. The magji, Lhalu, was the General Commander [Ch. zong si ling], and Tara [Tib. rta ra] Khenjung and many others were there. If the general headquarters was smashed, they would lose their command ability [Ch. shi diao zhi hui].   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  Wasn&apos;t Dosenge taken after Jokpori?   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong> These two were finished off at the same time, and the third was Norbulinga, where two regiments, the 155th and 159th Regiments, made the attack. The 155th Regiment attacked from the east and the 159th Regiment coordinated [Ch. pei he] from the north. The 155th Regiment also sent a company to the west, and the Automobile 16th Regiment [Ch. qi che 6th tuan] also assisted [Ch. xie zhu] in the attack by transporting weapons, hauling the war prisoners and such duties. When we attacked Norbulinga, the canon regiment and the infantry jointly fought very nicely.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong> The canons were fired from Trip, right?   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong> Yes. From Trip, the 120th Mortar [Regiment] shelled the Barkor, and they also brought the heavy mortar to Trungji Linga [Tib. drung spyi gling ga] and the place on this side of the Lhasa bridge. When they shelled Norbulinga, they used neither the Jianong Canon nor the Liudan Canon because the Liudan Canon is curved fire. So they used the 120th Heavy Mortar [Regiment] because in Norbulinga, there are many trees so mortars were good for that, and it was shelled from the side of the Lhasa bridge and Trungji Linga. Some part of the 155th Canon Regiment moved to the west gate of Norbulinga. When they attacked Norbulinga, the Gusung Regiment didn&#x2019;t make much resistance [Ch. di kang] because our canons were extremely powerful, which killed some of their commanders. Later, when we went in the Norbulinga to look, the officials of the Tibetan government were not wounded very much, but they were scared to death [Ch. xia si] and died from heart attacks because they had never seen such heavy shelling. One rup&#xF6;n had a good relationship with our 155th Regiment from when they did united front work [Ch. tong zhan gong zuo] with the Tibetan soldiers, and in 1955, we gave military uniforms to the Tibetan soldiers and gave military ranks to the Tibetan military officers. Ph&#xFC;ntso Tashi was a colonel [Ch. shang xiao]. At that time, this rup&#xF6;n was saying that, &quot;The PLA [has] treated us very nicely by giving us uniforms and other things, and building houses for us. So we should not fight with the PLA,&quot; and he collected about 250 guns from the one battalion, and voluntarily handed them over to the 155th Regiment. In the afternoon, around 5-6, or 4-5 p.m., Norbulinga was finished off.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  They sent the guns while the fighting was going on or after they stopped? Did they have those 250 guns inside Norbulinga?  </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  These 250 guns belonged to the soldiers inside Norbulinga, and they didn&#x2019;t fight and handed the guns over. At the east gate, there were some battalion soldiers of Chushigandru who fought a little, but not so much. I heard this from Qiao Xueting, the Political Commissar Shaodong of the 155th Regiment. He told me about this in great detail. At that time, the Military Command Area, on the one hand, was propagaandizing, and on the other hand was looking at the situation. The fourth [target] was the Trapchi Khadang Regiment, and it was finished off on the night of that day. The Trapchi Khadang Regiment had two dep&#xF6;n. One was Tashi Bera [Tib. bkra shis dpal rab], who went to India, and the other was Sambo Sey Tenzin Th&#xF6;ndrub [Tib. bsam pho sras bstan &#x2018;dzin don grub], who was the son of the Vice Commander Sambo. Sambo Sey Tenzin Th&#xF6;ndrub didn&#x2019;t leave Norbulinga and the Trapchi Khadang Regiment because his father was injured from being beaten by Chushigandru and was in the PLA hospital. Tenzin Th&#xF6;ndrub was one of the delegates who signed the 17-Point Agreement. So he was a little bit familiar with the CCP and the PLA, and he was not one of the culprits who launched the revolt. Sambo Tenzin Th&#xF6;ndrub gave orders to about 500-600 people, but he was not that determined [Ch. bu jian jue] to fight. So when they surrounded the regiment, after fighting for about 20 minutes, he handed over the weapons and surrendered. On that night, around 11-12 p.m., the Trapchi Regiment was finished off.  </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong> Was that on the 21st?   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong> It was on the 20th   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  How many soldiers were there under the Khadang Dep&#xF6;n?  </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  At that time, there were probably 400-500 soldiers because a little less than 200 had left for Lhoka to Chushigandru led by Andru Gombo Tashi [Tib. a &#x2018;brug mgon po bkra shis]. In 1958, they went along with Namseling [Tib. rnam sras gling].  </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  There was a khenjung with Namseling  </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  Yes. Some of the soldiers were in Norbulinga and Barkor. There were 400-500 soldiers who were in the regiment who surrendered, and the Trapchi Regiment was finished off. Then the only [ones] left were the Chushigandru in the Jokhang, Ramoche and Muru, where the Chadang Canon Regiment was stationed, and the Potala was also left. At that time, Tsarong [dzasa] was in the Potala. On the morning of the 21st, the most stubborn [Ch. wan gu] were the Chushigandru in Ramoche, where they fought a little bit and where there were quite a lot of casualties on our side. There were a little more than 20 casualties including a Vice Company Commander who was killed. The 6th dep&#xF6;n in Muru was finished off quite fast and surrendered on the morning of 21st. Some of their canons were in Muru and some of them were brought to Jokpori. As you see, Jokpori was taken pretty quickly, so they didn&#x2019;t have many canons left. Then only the Jokhang and the Potala were left. At noon on the 21st, our 155th Regiment surrounded the Jokhang and the armed forces wanted to blow up the Jokhang by using explosives [Ch. zha yiao] and by not using canons. However, the Political Commissar, Tan Guansan, resolutely stopped [Ch. jian jue zhi zhi] them from using the explosives. I heard this from the Vice Regimental Commander of the 155th, Wu Tingwu. Tan Guansan and Deng Shaodong analyzed the situation and said that the enemy had already been depressed and they didn&apos;t have enthusiasm to fight. So they decided to take the political offensive [Ch. zheng zhi gong shi] of propaganda by using big speakers, and making them hand over their weapons and surrender. And they said, &#x201C;If you hand over your weapons, we will not kill you [Ch. jiao qiang bu sha].&quot; At that time, I was one of the speakers and there was also Sh&#xF6;lkang Thubden Nyima and Langd&#xFC;n Pema. We recorded the words and said them over and over again through the speakers. The loudspeakers were set up on the roof of the Shatra House and the Kyit&#xF6;pa House, which used to be the office of Guomindang. The speakers were placed on these houses, which were close to the Jokhang. Like this they shouted for about half an hour. Then when it became night, they didn&#x2019;t dare fire at us, and we didn&#x2019;t attack them. From time to time, we saw a Khata waving from the window. Throughout the evening, I saw there were about 20-40 Khatas. Like this, we continued to broadcast, and in the morning of the next morning [the 22nd], there was not much fighting, and about 700 to 800 people, including the monk soldiers, the 2nd dep&#xF6;n, and the Chushigandru, surrendered from the Jokhang temple.  </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong> How many were captured from the Potala?   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  The Potala was the last place to surrender and there were about 300-400 people who surrendered. That was the end of the last battle, at around 10-11 a.m. Tsarong surrendered there. Like this, the battle lasted for three days, the 20th-21st and the 23rd, and then they surrendered.  </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong> How many were captured from Norbulinga?   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  One of the rup&#xF6;n surrendered and from Norbulinga, some fled through Drepung by crossing the mountain and fled to Phembo, and some people from Lhasa City also fled to Phembo, and then to Lhoka through Kongpo, where there were officials and also solders; we arrested some. In Norbulinga, there were 200 to 300 shot to death during the attack. In three days, we eliminated more than 5,600 people from among the 7,000 rebels, and some of them escaped.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  This amount includes the killed and captured, right?  </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  This includes the killed and wounded, but the majority were captured. The number of shot to death was no more than 800-900 people, and the others were war prisoners [Ch. fu lu] and the wounded. In this battle, we won a battle with fewer forces than the enemy. Our strategy was to concentrate the armed force and destroy them one by one [Ch. ji zhong bing li/ ge ge ji po].  </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  How many people did you PLA lose in the battle?  </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  There were around 100 PLA soldiers killed and wounded. About 40-50 [were] killed and the others were wounded. After one week, Ding Sheng and his 134th Division arrived in Lhasa from Qinghai. They then moved to Lhoka and joined the fight, and we welcomed them. Do you have any questions?  </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong> I just have one other question. I just got a new book two weeks ago where [it discusses] Tan Guansan&#x2019;s letter when he apologized to the Zhongyang for attacking first. Do you know about that?   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong> It was not to apologize. He said, &#x201C;I will self-critique [Ch. jian tao] and I will assume this responsibility [Ch. zhe ge ze ren wo fu].&quot; The Zhongyang Military Committee sent people to investigate [Ch. cha] and I was there when they did this. When they started investigating, in the beginning, Yang, the Political Commissar, who was wearing eye glasses, said, &#x201C;The Zhongyang Military Committee asked, &apos;Did you or did you not have the conditions to obey the instructions from the Zhongyang Military Committee to hold fast [to the positions] [Ch. ni men you mei you zun shou zhong yiang jun wei yao jian shou de zhi shi]? Were there conditions to hold fast or not [Ch. you mei you zhe ge jian shou de tiao jian]? Was it possible or not not to fight [Ch. bu da zhang xing bu xing]? Was it possible or not to wait for the 134th Division coming [Ch. deng dai yao san si lai xing bu xing]?&apos;&quot; This meeting was held for 2 hours and I was there the entire time. At that time, I was transferred to be the secretary to Tan Guansan. After the battle was over, for a month, my job was to collect the documents we got from the rebels from Norbulinga, Kundeling and from others. We gathered 15-16 translators, both Chinese and Tibetans, from the local force, and I was the team leader [Ch. zu zhang] of the translators. After that, they set up a translator&#x2019;s team and translated the documents that show that they [rebels] attacked first. We needed this material for the international propaganda. We translated more than 100 documents and supplied them to the leaders of the Military Command Area to report to the Zhongyang   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  After the war, you started doing the translations, right?  </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  Yes.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  How long did you translate the documents [for]?  </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  We translated for more than a month, and among the translators, there was Drokar [Tib. sgrol dkar], the late wife of Dorje Tseden [Tib. rdo rje tshe brtan].  </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  When did the Zhongyang Military Committee do the investigation?  </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong> After the translation was done, I was transferred to be the secretary of Tan Guansan, and there was another secretary called Jing Yangping. I was told to stay in Lhasa because there were still some translations to do and Jing Yangping accompanied Tan Guansan, when they were called to Beijing to make the reports to Premier Zhou and Chen Yi. While they left for Beijing and I was in Lhasa, General [Ch. shang jiang] Hong Xuezhi, the general director of the Logistic Bureau [Ch. zong hou qing bu zhang], led a work team which also included Director Yang [Ch. Yang Chuzhang], the director of the Combat Department [Ch. zuo zhan chu zhang]. When they came to Lhasa, they questioned us why we didn&#x2019;t stick to the Central Committee&#x2019;s instructions and opened fire early. Did we [not] have the condition to hold fast to the position [of not fighting]? They criticized us for that bombing [at Norbulinga], which was wrong, and investigated this. By that time, we had already received punishment and we were criticized. I accompanied them to inspect the outside of the Norbulinga. Even until today, the Dalai&#x2019;s propaganda was that their flight was due to the two bombs fired at Norbulinga. The Han attacked Norbulinga, and so we had to flee. It was said the two bombs landed inside Norbulinga, but they actually landed outside of it. I went to see that. [Other Chinese: How many investigating teams were sent to Tibet?] A very big work team [was] sent to Tibet to investigate. Hong Xuezhi was there because it was decided that suppression of the rebels would be carried out in Tibet. In the past, the policy was &#x2018;no reform in 6 years&#x2019; and &#x2018;appropriate contractions,&#x2019; but now, the policy was to put down the rebellions and carry out land reforms. This was a very big military operation, and stable logistical support [Ch. hou qing bao zhang] was important. So, General Hong Xuezhi [the director of the Logistics Department] came personally. At the same time, he took other cadres along to investigate. Director Yang from the Staff Operation Department [Ch. zhong can zuo zhan chu] also came along. From his combat standpoint, he was especially interested [in investigating the combat].   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  How did they answer when they were asked, &#x201C;Did you or did you not have the order to hold fast to [one&#x2019;s position]?  </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong> At that time, Wang Kang, the Chief of Staff of the Military Command Area, who was not in Lhasa during the Lhasa battle, came back to Lhasa with Zhang Guohua after the battle was finished. He presided [over] a meeting, and the Director of the Combat Department [Ch. zuo zhan chu zhang], Zou Hongming, the Vice Director of the Intelligence Office, Jiang Wenqi, and some others, attended the meeting. I was there when they answered the questions.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong> What did they ask him?   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong> Director Yang from the investigation team asked questions like, &#x201C;Was it okay or not not to fight [Ch. bu da xing bu xing]? Why did you fight without waiting for the [reinforcement] division to come?&quot; Wang Kang and Director Zhou answered by saying, &#x201C;Look, [the rebels] gave orders asking people between the ages of 18 and 60 to come. So how is it possible for us not to fight? We think that the decision [to fight] made by Political Commissar Tan Guansan was correct. [There is a Chinese saying, &#x2018;When the general is out in the battlefield, they may not listen to the order from the emperor [Ch. jiang zai wai jun ming you suo bu shu].&apos;&quot;   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong> Were these three people talking to Yang Chuzhang or were there a bunch of people?   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  They were only talking to Yang. Hong Xuezhi didn&#x2019;t come.  </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  How long did that take?  </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong> It took 2 hours for them to debate [Tib. rtsod pa brgyab] whether it was possible [or] not to fight. Finally, Yang became quiet [Ch. bu keng qi]. In the beginning, he was questioning and criticizing us, but eventually, he could not argue anymore. He did not know the situation well. And we gave a very detailed report of the situation.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong> Did he only talk to the three people?   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong> No, he talked to 7 to 9 people, including me.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong> What could they ask for [in] 2 hours?   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong> We debated. Initially, he [Yang] thought we should not fight and should just hold fast, and wait for the division to come. But we felt it was impossible not to start the battle   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  Was the 2 hours for each person or for all of them?   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong> For all of them. This matter was not decided until 2 months later in the second half of May, when the Zhongyang Military Committee finally stated that Tan made the right decision and the Lhasa battle was justified. Because of this, when we write history, Tan Guansan was always highly praised [Ch. ping jia], saying that he has great style, as he stood up for the people [Ch. dui ren min fu ze] and [was] willing to take responsibility for starting the war. Even though he might have made a mistake, he was courageous to take the risk, as well as the responsibility. And he was correct and highly praised [even] until today. This was written as [one of] his achievements.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  He had a very high status and he was talked about nicely, and I have noticed that. Your comments were fantastic; just like a movie, and it is very useful. Thank you.  </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong> I am also glad because we all all the same in thinking about Tibet. Now, my mind is in Beijing and you are in the US, but your mind is in Tibet.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong> This is true. We are from a long distance, but speak the same language.   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  I will present this, which is written by me and [speaking English] &#x201C;Good, better, best.&quot;  </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong> The good is better and better is the best. Did you make this?   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  Yes, I wrote this, &#x201C;Good, better, best [Ch. hao hao geng hao].&quot; Never stop and go forward [Ch. yiong yuan bu ting di xiang qian pao] from good, and then go to better and then go last to the best [Ch. cong hao dao hao dao geng zui hao]. The Tibetans also have a song saying, &#x201C;We must unite as one and we must unite into the warp and woof of the white Khata [Tib. nga tsho gcig la sgril shog/ nga tsho kha btags dkar po&#x2019;i/ rgyu dang spun la sgril shog].&quot; This shows that Tibet emphasizes unity very much.  </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong> Thank you. [Translator: Note on how the battle started in Lhasa: Until the battle actually started in the early morning of 11th day of 2nd lunar month, I never heard any gun shots and canon shots, and didn&#x2019;t even hear the two canon shells fall near Norbulinga. Wang Gui says that the rebels fired many guns and canons on the Transportation Station. I think this is only propaganda.]   </p>
