## Abstract  

 Setrong Wangye was a member of a rich shungyupa (government taxpayer) family [Tib. གཤུང་རྒྱུགས་པ]) in Tülung [Tib. སྟོད་ལུང] district. His family had large land holdings with its own miser [Tib. མི་སེར] or bound peasants/serfs and also held the position of Gyatso gembo [Tib. རྒྱ་མཚོ་རྒན་པོ] for the district. He discusses taxes and an interesting law case between the miser and the district head [Tib. རྫོང་དཔོན] concerning harvesting Dechen district's fields including how the case was settled in Lhasa. He also details the duties of the district's tsodrag [Tib. གཙོ་དྲག] and dingpön officials and discusses Lungshar's reinvestigation of land and taxes.

**A:**    

**Q:**  The uprising against Gabde was also just before the revolt, and it was a big peasant's revolt, right?   

**A:**  Yes. they formally appealed to the government. It was a big law case.   

**Q:**  What was the reason for the revolt?   

**A:**  It must be something like that [an irrigation dispute]. I don't know the details. After the revolt the song and dance troupe did the a lot of performances about this.   

**Q:**  Can you tell us some other examples of conflicts between <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. མི་སེར] A term that can mean serf/bound subject as well as citizen, depending on context. For example, the miser of a lord would connote the bound subjects of that lord, whereas the miser of Tibet would connote citizens of Tibet.">miser</span> and lords and how they were settled?   

**A:**  I have had many experiences, although it is hard to find ones that were cleanly and easily settled to tell you about. One case was in Dechen district. It involved 40-50 households and the district head, who at that time was a monk official who was the shabdöpa of the Ex-Governor of Kham, the Doji Dzasa called Chamba Thubten [Tib. བྱམས་པ་ཐུབ་བསྟན].   

**Q:**  He died.   

**A:**  When?   

**Q:**  He was the older brother of Phuntso Yügye's [Tib. ཕུན་ཚོགས་གཡུ་རྒྱལ] wife.   

**A:**  After he was imprisoned and released, he was in the Municipality Political Consultative Conference [Ch. shi zheng xie]. I heard that he is staying in Surkhang. It was the time when he was the district [head].   

**Q:**  This must have been in in 1947-47 just before the Chinese came, right?   

**A:**  Yes, it was around that time. Actually, his term was 3 years, but he was removed after 2 years, one year before his term was over. The reason why he was removed was that when he was the district head, there was a large area of fields that belonged to the district. When it was time for the harvest, these 40-50 <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. མི་སེར] A term that can mean serf/bound subject as well as citizen, depending on context. For example, the miser of a lord would connote the bound subjects of that lord, whereas the miser of Tibet would connote citizens of Tibet.">miser</span> in the area had to come every year to harvest the district's field for 3 days. This was called the three days "<span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. དཔོན་པོ, མངའ་བདག] 1. A manorial estate holder. 2. Chief of an area.">lord</span>'s harvest" [Tib. དཔོན་བཙས]. During this three days, all of the people who were able to do labor had to go and in principle, the district's harvest would be completed in three days. They received food and a wage of 3 <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. ཞོ] A unit in the traditional Tibetan currency system. 10 sho equaled to 1 sang and 10 karma equaled one sho.">sho</span> per day. The previous district head was <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. གདོང་པོར] The name of an aristocratic family. The family was also known as Tashi Lingpa [tib. བཀྲིས་གླིང་པ].">Dombor</span> [Tib. གདོང་པོར]. Since his household was rich, he slaughtered a yak at this time and gave all the meat to the miser during these three days, as well as an abundance of <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. རྩམ་པ] The traditional Tibetan staple food that consists of grain that is roasted (popped), usually in heated sand, and then ground into a flour.">tsamba</span>, dishes made from radish and potatoes and also very good tea. They treated the miser very kindly. Chamba Thubten, however, was too stingy. He was really ridiculous and didn't give food to the miser saying, "Now, the tsamba hasn't been ground, so first bring your own tsamba." Then I heard that the miser said, "If so, please give us tea." However, the miser were saying that he gave them a tea that was like the plain boiled water used for slaughtering pigs. I am not sure whether he had added tea leaves or not. Probably he didn't. He also didn't pay them wages. So in the 2nd year [of his term], when he summoned the miser to work, some of the household fathers [household heads] living below the Dechen District said, "We are not going to harvest because you treated us like this [badly] last year. First give us the last year's tsamba which is 4 <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. བྲེ] A unit of traditional volume measurement [a container] in Tibet, 20 of which typically equaled one khe or bo [also a container], although in some areas there were only 16 dre in one khe.">dre</span> and 3 phul for three days and the wages and of course you have to give us the tsamba for this year." He [the district head] said, "It would not be alright if you don't come to harvest." And then he pulled out a pistol and waved it at the miser and said, "Are you coming or not coming tomorrow." That evening some of the miser leaders came to me about this. I said I will try to help you tomorrow morning. So I went with them the next morning to the district. I met the district head and said, "You shouldn't do this. Give them last year's tsamba and wages. If you do not have the tsamba ready, if you give them barley it will be all right. You should give them the wages and good food. During the Dombor era, that was done. You should give them the tsamba and the tea with some more butter and I will make them harvest the fields." The miser had a list of people who went and it was about 200-300 person for three days. So that came to about 60 <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. ཁལ] A traditional volume measurement used for measuring grain in traditional Tibetan society. Sizes of this unit varied somewhat, but the official government khe (called mkhar ru or bstan dzin mkha ru) weighed about 28-31 pounds for barley. It was used to convey the size of fields. For example, a field said to be 10 khe in size meant that 10 khe of seed could be sown on that field.">khe</span> of barley [that they were owed]. However, the district head was too stingy and didn't want to give the barley, so he said, "I don't have the barley to give them right away. After the harvest, I will give it to them gradually. First, have them do the harvest." I said, "I can't say that." I tried to convince him, but he refused and said only that he will give the grain slowly later to them. So I went to tell the miser this and we discussed what they planned to do. That night there was a big discussion and they decided to send one person from each household to Lhasa to make an appeal. They asked me to come with them and I agreed, but I said there is no need to send one person from each household, 7-8 people will be fine. So they agreed. There was a person called Papa Trinley who was a tough person and I told him, "You should lead the miser and look at the fields and when the time comes to harvest, harvest your own fields and probably the district might not provoke you. In case the district again provokes you, just say you are sorry and do whatever you can do like running away, but do not get beaten. Just go ahead and harvest your own fields and leave the district's harvest." So the next morning we went to Lhasa riding horses. The miser left early that morning and there were 7-8 of us. I wrote a petition according to the system to be submitted to the Kashag.   

**Q:**  How would you submit the petition to the Kashag?   

**A:**  Usually Gadrung Dumra [Tib. བཀའ་དྲུང་ལྡུམ་ར] [one of the Kashag's aides] was a person who would always scold people a lot, but since I had to go to the Kashag many times, he would treat me very nicely and he was a nice person. So first I went to Gadrung Dumra and showed him the petition and told him about the case and I said, "Please submit this to the Kashag and I am going to come to the Kashag tomorrow."   

**Q:**  Did you have to give him one kind of gift?   

**A:**  Normally, all the petitions would be submitted through either the <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. བཀའ་དྲུང] Lay officials who worked as administrative aides/secretaries to the Kalön of the Kashag.">gadrung</span> or the <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. བཀའ་མགྲོན] The position of aide to the Kashag that was filled by lay aristocratic officials.">gandrön</span> [two kinds of aides]. I gave him a <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. ཁ་བཏགས] A Tibetan ceremonial scarf given to lamas, visitors, etc.">khata</span> and an envelope with some money and requested him to submit the petition. He gave me back the khata and money and said, "It will be alright, this is a case related to the <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. མི་སེར] A term that can mean serf/bound subject as well as citizen, depending on context. For example, the miser of a lord would connote the bound subjects of that lord, whereas the miser of Tibet would connote citizens of Tibet.">miser</span>, come tomorrow morning to the Kashag." The next morning, I went with some of the household heads of the miser to the Kashag. He [Gadrung Dumra] took the petition and asked me, "How many representatives do you have here?" I said we have this number of people. He said, "You people just go back right away as you have to do the harvest. I will make sure you have a response in 2-3 days." Then I told the others to go back and I will stay. The next morning when I went to Dumra. He said the case had been transferred to the <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. ཡིག་ཚང] The highest office dealing with monastic and religious affairs in the traditional Tibetan government. It is often called the Ecclesiastic Office. It was headed by 4 fourth rank monk officials called Trunyichemmo. The senior Trunyichemmo was called Ta Lama.">Yigtsang</span> [Ecclesiastics Office] so I should go there to pursue the case.   

**Q:**  It was because he [the district head] was a monk official, right?   

**A:**  Yes. So I went to the Potala to the <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. ཡིག་ཚང] The highest office dealing with monastic and religious affairs in the traditional Tibetan government. It is often called the Ecclesiastic Office. It was headed by 4 fourth rank monk officials called Trunyichemmo. The senior Trunyichemmo was called Ta Lama.">Yigtsang</span> Office and they said, "Yes we have the case and it will be decided immediately. Just wait for today, and we will make the decision."   

**Q:**  Who was the <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. ཡིག་ཚང] The highest office dealing with monastic and religious affairs in the traditional Tibetan government. It is often called the Ecclesiastic Office. It was headed by 4 fourth rank monk officials called Trunyichemmo. The senior Trunyichemmo was called Ta Lama.">Yigtsang</span>'s secretary (Tib. ཡིགཙང་ཉེརཔ [ཡིག་ཚང་གཉེར་པ])?   

**A:**  He was the one nicknamed Kamtragla [Tib. སྐམ་སྐྲག་ལགས]. I knew him and he was also a nice person. So I went the next day and they said, "We have sent the edict. You are the Gyatso Gembo, so you go back and take the responsibility and make the district head pay the <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. མི་སེར] A term that can mean serf/bound subject as well as citizen, depending on context. For example, the miser of a lord would connote the bound subjects of that lord, whereas the miser of Tibet would connote citizens of Tibet.">miser</span> the wages and <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. རྩམ་པ] The traditional Tibetan staple food that consists of grain that is roasted (popped), usually in heated sand, and then ground into a flour.">tsamba</span> for the previous year immediately. As for the next district head, we will send a real person."   

**Q:**  Did Kamtragla say that?   

**A:**  Yes. He meant that Chamba Thubdenla was not like a human being.   

**Q:**  He really was not like a real man.   

**A:**  He didn't have any ability.   

**Q:**  But he was the boy friend of Jawtang [Tib. ལྕོག་སྟེང] [a famous Trunyichemmo].   

**A:**  That's why he was given to the Doji Dzasa and he got all the inheritance of the Doji Dzasa. That day I returned home and the next day I went to the district. That day the district's 12 <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. ནང་ཟན] A type of serf/bound peasant who lived in the house of his or her lord and worked as a servant without pay.">nangsen</span> were harvesting the crop and the district head was there overseeing them. I dismounted my horse and saluted to him by taking off my hat. He asked where have you been. I said to Lhasa. He said, "The <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. མི་སེར] A term that can mean serf/bound subject as well as citizen, depending on context. For example, the miser of a lord would connote the bound subjects of that lord, whereas the miser of Tibet would connote citizens of Tibet.">miser</span> are not coming to harvest, so I am planning to do it by myself."   

**Q:**  He was just saying that in a sarcastic manner, right?   

**A:**  Yes. Then I said, "Sir [Tib. ཀུངö]! Most probably you will receive an edict from the Yigtsang. They made a decision about the harvesting." He said, "What happened?" I said, "I don't have any details to tell you. When the edict arrives, you will know." The edict came the next day. It had been sent through the post till Dongkar [Tib. གདོང་དཀར] and then through the pony messenger from one district to the next [Tib. rzdong skyel rta shad]. I got a message to come to the district. The district head was sitting reading the edict and he had a long face [Tib. ཞལ་རས་གློད]. I just went through the motions of asking him what was in the edict. He gave it to me and I read it. I said, "Oh, I see. If this is the case, will you give them the <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. རྩམ་པ] The traditional Tibetan staple food that consists of grain that is roasted (popped), usually in heated sand, and then ground into a flour.">tsamba</span> and wages for the previous year tomorrow or the day after that?" The district head said, "Well, first I will think about this." Then I told him there is not much to think about it because it is time to harvest the fields. Usually, many <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. མི་སེར] A term that can mean serf/bound subject as well as citizen, depending on context. For example, the miser of a lord would connote the bound subjects of that lord, whereas the miser of Tibet would connote citizens of Tibet.">miser</span> would harvest the district's fields, but this year they could just harvest a little bit. He asked me, "How shall we do the harvest for this year?" I said, "If you give them food, I will tell them to come, if not, I can't tell them that. You have to give them last year's barley first." Then on the next day, I counted the barley for last year which was 1 <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. བྲེ] A unit of traditional volume measurement [a container] in Tibet, 20 of which typically equaled one khe or bo [also a container], although in some areas there were only 16 dre in one khe.">dre</span> and 3 phul per day. The total was about 60 <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. ཁལ] A traditional volume measurement used for measuring grain in traditional Tibetan society. Sizes of this unit varied somewhat, but the official government khe (called mkhar ru or bstan dzin mkha ru) weighed about 28-31 pounds for barley. It was used to convey the size of fields. For example, a field said to be 10 khe in size meant that 10 khe of seed could be sown on that field.">khe</span> of barley. I made him pay that to the miser one by one. Then I told the miser that you have to do the harvest of the district tomorrow. The district head said that he hadn't ground the tsamba, and will pay you the barley [instead of tsamba] after the harvest. I will guarantee that he will pay it. The next day, early morning, I got it from the district head and gave it to the miser. This time they did the district and miser's harvesting simultaneously as it was late. The district head was withdrawn after his second year because of this, and then Gyentsen Phüntsola took over the district from him. Wasn't that the time when the district was managed by the government?   

**Q:**  No. This was long after that in 1954.   

**A:**  Oh yes. this was in 1954. Then probably the short monk official nicknamed Tsogrila came.   

**Q:**  What are the <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. གཙོ་དྲག] An important local dzong/county official in the traditional society who was selected from among the rich peasant households or estates in the dzong.">tsodrag</span>'s duties?   

**A:**  They were established by the 13th Dalai Lama. Although there used to be just a name of that, but they couldn't [answer not finished]   

**Q:**  Under the <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. གཙོ་དྲག] An important local dzong/county official in the traditional society who was selected from among the rich peasant households or estates in the dzong.">tsodrag</span>, there was the <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. ལྡིང་དཔོན] A non-commissioned military officer in the traditional Tibetan Army in charge of 25 soldiers (a platoon). It is an alternative name for Shengo in the army.">dingpön</span>, right?   

**A:**  Dingpön was a term used in the border areas like Nyan [Tib. གཉན] and Lhuntse and it is equivalent to the Gyatso Gembo. The duty of the <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. གཙོ་དྲག] An important local dzong/county official in the traditional society who was selected from among the rich peasant households or estates in the dzong.">tsodrag</span> is to be the <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. མི་སེར] A term that can mean serf/bound subject as well as citizen, depending on context. For example, the miser of a lord would connote the bound subjects of that lord, whereas the miser of Tibet would connote citizens of Tibet.">miser</span>'s representative. If there is any trouble to be settled in that area regarding the taxes or law cases, in the edicts they would normally write that the district head and tsodrag should jointly make the decision. It was the person who would discuss things with the district. In our Tsede district, there were 6-7 households who were tsogdrag: The aristocrats Changöba, Ringang, Kündeling, and the Tshurphu and the Para Estate plus 2-3 from <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. གཞུང་རྒྱུགས་པ] A type of bound peasant/miser/serf whose lord was the government rather than an aristocrat or monastery/lama. They usually had sizable land holdings and were primarily responsible for providing the corvée transport and riding animal tax for the Tibetan government&#x27;s transportation system. Often translated as, &quot;Government taxpayer serfs.&quot;">shungyupa</span> households including me. But this is just said verbally and is written in the document, but in reality, the head of the district settles the issues himself. The tsodrag have no power. They were called for meetings, etc. They would call the tsodrag from everywhere when they do things like collecting grain from the <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. འབབ་གཞི] The land investigation of manorial estates that was devised and conducted by Lungshar in order to raise new tax revenue from these estates for the 13th Dalai Lama&#x27;s program of modernization, especially the expansion of the army.">babshi</span> [Tib. འབབ་ཞིབ] tax. A district head or his representative would come from the district and they would make the tsodrag do the jobs like measuring grain and that stuff. The most power would be the district head or his representative. The tsodrag didn't have power at all.   

**Q:**  Did the <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. གཙོ་དྲག] An important local dzong/county official in the traditional society who was selected from among the rich peasant households or estates in the dzong.">tsodrag</span> get a salary?   

**A:**  No. They also brought their own food.   

**Q:**  Under the district, there were the Gyatso Gembo and <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. གཙོ་དྲག] An important local dzong/county official in the traditional society who was selected from among the rich peasant households or estates in the dzong.">tsodrag</span>, right? Who else were there?   

**A:**  The <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. རྒན་བོ] A village headman. Such headmen were responsible for organizing the different households to pay the village&#x27;s taxes in-kind and labor. They also played a role in settling minor disputes and were the link between the village and the higher authorities.

This large administrative unit was headed by one or two district heads (tib. dzongpön [རྫོང་དཔོན]) appointed by the Tibetan government. Typically there was one lay official and one monk official who were jointly sent from Lhasa for three year terms. They were responsible for collecting taxes and adjudicating disputes in their district. These dzong were equivalent to counties (ch. 县) in the current Chinese system of administration.">dzong</span> or the <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. མི་སེར] A term that can mean serf/bound subject as well as citizen, depending on context.

For example, the miser of a lord would connote the bound subjects of that lord, whereas the miser of Tibet would connote citizens of Tibet.">miser</span> would appoint them.

**A:**  No. There were different kinds of systems [for selecting <span class "tooltip" data-text "[tib. རྒན་བོ] A village headman. Such headmen were responsible for organizing the different households to pay the village&#x27;s taxes in-kind and labor. They also played a role in settling minor disputes and were the link between the village and the higher authorities.

The <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. མི་སེར] A term that can mean serf/bound subject as well as citizen, depending on context. For example, the miser of a lord would connote the bound subjects of that lord, whereas the miser of Tibet would connote citizens of Tibet.">miser</span> would say that we should do it by rotation. But if the household whose turn came up didn't have a capable people, they will discuss it. Although at that time we didn't call it an election, normally most of the miser would request that an older and better man in the village be the gembo. This was done by the miser themselves. For example, nearby there was a village called Gyatö [Tib. རྒྱ་སྟོད] which had 7 tax fields or <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. ཁྲལ་རྐང] The name of the basic tax unit for arable land in traditional Tibetan society. Families with farm land would have one or more fields of different sizes, e.g., 1 tregang or 1/2 of a tregang. This was defined by a fixed number of khe of seed (tib. sönkhe) that would be sown on that field. For example, one tregang in some areas would consist of 10 sönkhe. There was substantial variation between and within regions and types of estates.">tregang</span> (Tib. ཁྲལ་རྐང). They required a gembo for their 12-13-14 households and they got together and insisted and asked that one capable man called Tsedrug [Tib. ཚེས་དྲུག] be the gembo because they had trouble when they did the rotation. They decided to divide some portion of his <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. རྐང] The basic land measurement unit for tax obligations in the traditional Tibetan society. One gang was considered a full tax unit of land. A gang was measured by volume, specifically by the amount of seed (sönkhe) that could be sown. This amount was not standardized and the size of one gang varied under different lords.">gang</span>dro [Tib. རྐང་འགྲོ] taxes among the other miser [as payment]. So he got a kind of wages for doing the gembo job and he accepted. Some of them also did it on rotation where the estate made the order of the rotation and they did the gembo in terms of a year. We government txpayer serfs or <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. གཞུང་རྒྱུགས་པ] A type of bound peasant/miser/serf whose lord was the government rather than an aristocrat or monastery/lama. They usually had sizable land holdings and were primarily responsible for providing the corvée transport and riding animal tax for the Tibetan government&#x27;s transportation system. Often translated as, &quot;Government taxpayer serfs.&quot;">shungyupa</span> [Tib. གཞུང་རྒྱུགས་པ] actually had two kinds of tax fields or gang [Tib. རྐང]. One was the "existing gang," or degang [Tib. བསྡད་རྐང] and the other was the 7, 33 "extinct gang," or donggang [Tib. སྟོང་རྐང]. The donggang had a little bit of concessions on the gangdro taxes because only the man and the land was linked on that and there wasn't any animal [transport taxes]. Regarding this, the aristocratic and religious estates used to complain that shungyupa had a lot of land, but they didn't have to work much for taxes. During <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. ལུང་ཤར] The family name of a famous aristocratic lay official during the time of the 13th Dalai Lama and the Regent Reting.">Lungshar</span>'s time, he did an investigation and made a new tax called shiphar [Tib. ཞིབ་འཕར] which was an extra tax made after his investigation of the aristocratic and religious estates that involved a large amount of barley to be collected. They also set up an office to collect it.   

**Q:**  The Iron-Tiger Year Land Enumeration was not done by <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. ལུང་ཤར] The family name of a famous aristocratic lay official during the time of the 13th Dalai Lama and the Regent Reting.">Lungshar</span>, right?   

**A:**  Right. It was made in 1830. There used to be many land enumerations like the Fire-Sheep Year Enumeration, but those were partially done in some areas and weren't done completely, and it was inconvenient to impose the taxes and there was a lot of chaos among the miser. Then, after the 9th or the 10th Dalai Lama passed away, during the Tsomönling [Tib. ཚེ་སྨོན་གླིང] Regent, he made the Iron-Tiger Land Enumeration. There were a few people who said that this was very good, but the majority were saying that it was not fair.

**Q:**  Did <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. བསམ་ཕོ] The abbreviated name of one of the largest and most powerful aristocratic families (Samdru Phodrang).">Sambo</span> have to pay this as an extra tax each year?   

**A:**  Yes.   

**Q:**  So this became income for the government, right?   

**A:**  Yes. Similarly, the other aristocrats had to pay 1,000-2,000-400-500 <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. ཁལ] A traditional volume measurement used for measuring grain in traditional Tibetan society.

**A:**  Yes. Therefore, during the time when the 13th Dalai Lama was alive, the Kudrak couldn't handle <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. ལུང་ཤར] The family name of a famous aristocratic lay official during the time of the 13th Dalai Lama and the Regent Reting.">Lungshar</span> because he was capable and he could report whatever he wanted to the Dalai Lama. In the archives, I saw many of his reports to the Dalai Lama when he went to <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. གཙང] One of the major sub-areas of Tibet that is located in southwest Tibet. Its main city is Shigatse.">Tsang</span> for the investigation [of land and taxes]. He would get the approval of the Dalai Lama for whatever he reported. He was a very capable person who thought about the government and probably there wasn't a single aristocrat who didn't have to pay the [additional] shiphar [Tib. ཞིབ་འཕར] tax. They set up an office called Shiphar Lekhung which collected large amounts of barley. Therefore, all of the aristocrats were badly hurt and as soon as the 13th Dalai Lama passed away, Lungshar was destroyed. Actually, Lungshar didn't do anything wrong, but there was a lot of talk saying that there were some internal and external [factors] [Tib. ཕྱི་ནང་གཉིས]. Finally, they gouged out his eyeballs and confiscated his property and decreed that his children were not allowed to become government officials. Lhalu was Lungshar's son, but they said that his father was Shelkar Lingpa [Tib. ཤེལ་དཀར་གླིང་པ] so he was able to become a government official.
