**Q:**  Normally, all the people in Tibet - even those people whose hairs have gone white - are saying that everything is made by the abbots of three great monasteries, but, they are just passing off their responsibility onto them. Actually, the abbots couldn't make any final decisions. There were some little events, like when the Chinese influenced the abbots of <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. བློ་གསལ་གླིང] One of the main colleges in Drepung Monastery.">Loseling</span>, <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. སེ་ར་བྱེས] The Jey (Je) College of Sera Monastery.">Sera Jey</span>, <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. སྨད] The Mey College of Sera Monastery.">Mey</span>, and Ngagpa. At that time, the Chinese Sheng went in the great monastic seats (Tib. དེནས [Tib. གདན་ས]), but he wouldn't go to the abbot personally and he might have sent the abbot of Gyerong. Actually, if the government officials hadn't influenced them [the abbots], the abbots won't even dare to move like this, right?   

**A:**  You are right. Usually, the abbots were very insistent and regarding that definitely the <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. སྐུ་དྲག] 1. A member of the lay aristocracy. 2. Title for government lay and monk officials. 3. A name occasionally used for the top leaders/officials in a monastery.">kudrak</span> were behind them.   

**Q:**  Maybe people like the Chinese <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. ཆོས་མཛད] The title of monks who made a payment or gave gifts to secure exemption from the normal &quot;young monk&quot; work obligations. There were tratsang chöndze and khamtsen chöndze.">chöndze</span> have influenced them [abbots], right?   

**A:**  There were several cases where the Chinese thought that they would not be able to enter the monastery if they didn't become monks. This also one of the causes of losing Tibet.   

**Q:**  It is certain a Chinese went to the <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. བློ་གསལ་གླིང] One of the main colleges in Drepung Monastery.">Loseling</span> abbot and gave him a monk's töngag [Tib. སྟོད་འགག] made from the brocade called Marser Gyendrug [Tib. དམར་སེར་རྒྱན་དྲུག྄]. This was written in <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. ཞྭ་སྒབ་པ] The name of the family of an important lay official during the 1940s and 1950s.">Shakabpa</span>'s book. It was said widely that the abbot was influenced by the Chinese. I heard it was written in documents of the Guomindang that they gave the töngag and such things to the abbot.   

**A:**  Regarding the setting up of schools, it was the <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. སེ་ར་བྱེས] The Jey (Je) College of Sera Monastery.">Sera Jey</span> abbot who spoke.   

**Q:**  <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. ཀ་ཤོད་པ] A famous Tibetan aristocrat who was involved in many important political intrigues.">Kapshöba</span> was saying that Drepung Ngagpa Khembo was the person who was pushing hard for this [Tib. ཤུགས་རྒྱག].   

**A:**  I don't know the internal things, but I heard that the <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. བྱེས] The name of one of the largest colleges in Sera Monastery. It was the college of Reting Rimpoche.">Jey</span> Khembo was the person who first talked at the meeting.   

**Q:**  You don't need to mention the names of the people, you can just tell me what the people from the two groups said during the meeting. Among the two groups, Kungö Ta Lama [Tib. སྐུ་ངོ་ཏ་བླ་མ] Jawdang [Tib. ལྕོག་སྟེང]] was one of the people saying that we shouldn't set up the school, right?   

**A:**  Probably not.   

**Q:**  Probably he was, because there is much information from everywhere showing that [Tib. བཟོ་ཏ་ཆེན་པོ་འདུག].   

**A:**  What we were talking about in the monastery was that it was made by the <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. སྐུ་དྲག] 1. A member of the lay aristocracy. 2. Title for government lay and monk officials. 3. A name occasionally used for the top leaders/officials in a monastery.">kudrak</span> and not the abbots. It was Rebe Gyawu of the <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. སེ་ར་བྱེས] The Jey (Je) College of Sera Monastery.">Sera Jey</span> who talked to him. The Sera Jey abbott spoke at the Abbreviated Assembly saying that he objects to having the school opened. However it was not the Sera Jey abbot who moved the decision of the government because a large number of government officials did not want the school to open. They made strong objections and the decision was swung. Otherwise, if all the government officials were in favor of the English School, then even if there was the Sera abbot's objection, even if he screamed and shouted, nobody is going to yell for that.   

**Q:**  Do you have anything more to elaborate about this?   

**A:**  I don't have much to elaborate on.   

**Q:**  They didn't let them set up the school, right?   

**A:**  The school was set and then it was made to close. After that, the abbots came.   

**Q:**  Was <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. ཀ་ཤོད་པ] A famous Tibetan aristocrat who was involved in many important political intrigues.">Kapshöba</span> among Reting's inner circle like Khardo and Nyungne?   

**A:**  At that time, I heard that there was a group that had an internal talk that it would be good if we could set up a democracy.   

**Q:**  Was <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. ཀ་ཤོད་པ] A famous Tibetan aristocrat who was involved in many important political intrigues.">Kapshöba</span> in that group?   

**A:**  Later, <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. ཀ་ཤོད་པ] A famous Tibetan aristocrat who was involved in many important political intrigues.">Kapshöba</span> was in that.   

**Q:**  How was he there?   

**A:**  <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. ཀ་ཤོད་པ] A famous Tibetan aristocrat who was involved in many important political intrigues.">Kapshöba</span> was among one <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. སྐུ་དྲག] 1. A member of the lay aristocracy. 2. Title for government lay and monk officials. 3. A name occasionally used for the top leaders/officials in a monastery.">kudrak</span> group and he was also passing information to the other group saying that they are doing this and that.   

**Q:**  What about the incident at the <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. བཅོ་ལྔ་མཆོད་པ] The festival on the 15th of the first Tibetan month when butter sculptures were exhibited.">Jönga Chöpa</span> [Tib. བཅོ་ང་མཆོད་པ]?   

**A:**  <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. ཀ་ཤོད་པ] A famous Tibetan aristocrat who was involved in many important political intrigues.">Kapshöba</span> was in that.   

**Q:**  What was the reason for him to be in that?   

**A:**  Reting had an internal letter exchange with Kapshöba.   

**Q:**  Later, all the letters were searched, right?   

**A:**  At that time, <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. ཀ་ཤོད་པ] A famous Tibetan aristocrat who was involved in many important political intrigues.">Kapshöba</span> didn't come out openly, but he was communicating through letters with Reting. People didn’t know whether he had burnt the letters.   

**Q:**  Probably, they didn't search for the letters from Reting Labrang though they searched them from Khardo and Nyungne, right?   

**A:**  I don't know clearly about the letters in the Labrang. But <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. ཀ་ཤོད་པ] A famous Tibetan aristocrat who was involved in many important political intrigues.">Kapshöba</span> knew all about the inner matters.   

**Q:**  Did you have any talk with the late Thubden Sangpo [Tib. ཐུབ་བསྟན་བཟང་པོ] regarding Reting and China?   

**A:**  Thubden Sangpo said that Reting requested Chiang Kaishek to give him support and he (Thubden Sangpo) sent a telegram [to Lhasa] saying that Reting is doing that with Chiang Kaishek, so you should be careful and do whatever you can do. It was said that he knew about that from Kujar Kumbela [Tib. སྐུ་བཅར་ཀུན་འཕེལ་ལགས]. I doubt that Kujar would have lied.   

**Q:**  So did you talk with Thubden Sangpo regarding whether he had investigated that matter?   

**A:**  What I heard from him was that it was not the Guomindang; it was the communists. If the communists helped and made war, Reting probably promised to give him quite a large area of the territory to the communists. He said that he knew clearly about that.   

**Q:**  How did he know about that?   

**A:**  Regarding this matter, I had a little talk with him about Reting . He didn't like Reting at all and said, "How could he lease the regency? That's ridiculous. Because he leased the regency [Tib. རྒྱལ་པོ་བོགས་མ་བཏང] it had this consequence. Thubden Sangpo said that he was the representative [of the Tibetan government] in China. He [Reting] communicated with China and the representative didn't know that.   

**Q:**  How could that be?   

**A:**  He didn't know whether the letter was sent to the Chinese officers or not. He said, "I knew that Reting promised to give some territory to the Chinese. So I submitted a report to the government."   

**Q:**  Didn't he tell you from where he heard about this?   

**A:**  At that time, there were all kinds of rumors in China.   

**Q:**  Who took the measures in China to get their support?   

**A:**  Probably, there must have been some pro-Reting people there.   

**Q:**  Didn't Thubden Sangpo tell you about this?   

**A:**  No.   

**Q:**  This morning I told you about Gyapönbu. He was the one who went to China.   

**A:**  There was a person called Gyabing Chöndze.   

**Q:**  Did you see him later on?   

**A:**  How could he be here? They held <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. ཐམཛིང་ཙོནདུ (འཐབ་འཛིང་ཚོགས་འདུ); ch. 斗争会] Public accusation meetings at which the masses criticized and attacked (struggled against) class enemies and reactionaries, etcetera. Typically, the object of a struggle session would stand in front of the meeting bent over at the waist while the masses questioned and criticized, and often beat him/her.">struggle session</span> against him and he died under severe suffering.   

**Q:**  Didn't he go to China?   

**A:**  No, he didn't.   

**Q:**  Probably, they were relatives?   

**A:**  Probably, his relative went.
