**Q:**  In the past, you were in the monastery?   

**A:**  Yes.   

**Q:**  When we were in the monastery, there were four monks in your family?   

**A:**  Yes.   

**Q:**  The first was the ex-khembo of the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. སྡེ་ཡངས] One of the colleges in Drepung Monastery.">Deyang</a> College; his name is Sipo right?

**Q:**  Is he your relative?   

**A:**  Yes. Another one was Khyenrab [Tib. མཁྱེན་རབ] who has the good voice in chanting (dönsang [Tib. འདོན་བཟང]) in the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. གྲྭ་ཚང] A &quot;college&quot; within a monastery, for example, in Drepung Monastery there were four main tratsang: Gomang, Loseling, Deyang and Ngagpa. These tratsang were property owning corporate entities and included monks who were organized into residential dormitories called Khamtsen.">tratsang</a> (college). He and Nyare Amcho [Tib. ཉག་རེ་ཨ་མཆོད] were the same period as me and all together we had 4.   

**Q:**  You were the smallest, right?   

**A:**  Yes.   

**Q:**  When did you enter the monastery?   

**A:**  I entered the monastery when I was 4 years old.   

**Q:**  How did you come to <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. བློ་གསལ་གླིང] One of the main colleges in Drepung Monastery.">Loseling</a>?   

**A:**  At first, I entered in <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. སྡེ་ཡངས] One of the colleges in Drepung Monastery.">Deyang</a> at the age of 4 and I was there for one year. Khyenrab [Tib. མཁྱེན་རབ] has taken me to Loseling.   

**Q:**  So at that time, Khyenrab is already in <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. བློ་གསལ་གླིང] One of the main colleges in Drepung Monastery.">Loseling</a>, right?   

**A:**  Khyenrab was a senior monk of <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. བློ་གསལ་གླིང] One of the main colleges in Drepung Monastery.">Loseling</a> and he entered long time ago.   

**Q:**  He is a senior monk, but who was the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. མཁན་པོ] Abbot of a monastery or monastic college.">khembo</a>?   

**A:**  When I first joined the monastery, the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. མཁན་པོ] Abbot of a monastery or monastic college.">khembo</a> is Lhopa [Tib. ལྷོ་པ].   

**Q:**  At that time, Sipo <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. མཁན་པོ] Abbot of a monastery or monastic college.">khembo</a> was in <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. སྡེ་ཡངས] One of the colleges in Drepung Monastery.">Deyang</a> right?

**Q:**  How did Khyenrab come to <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. བློ་གསལ་གླིང] One of the main colleges in Drepung Monastery.">Loseling</a> when his brother, Sipo <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. མཁན་པོ] Abbot of a monastery or monastic college.">khembo</a>, was in <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. སྡེ་ཡངས] One of the colleges in Drepung Monastery.">Deyang</a>?   

**A:**  That was because we were the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. མི་སེར] A term that can mean serf/bound subject as well as citizen, depending on context. For example, the miser of a lord would connote the bound subjects of that lord, whereas the miser of Tibet would connote citizens of Tibet.">miser</a> of <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. རྣམ་རྒྱལ] 1.

The name of the Dalai Lama&#x27;s monastery located in the Potala Palace [tib. rnam rgyal grwa tshamg].">Namgyal</a> [Tib. རྣམ་རྒྱལ] Tratsang and we were from Tsena [Tib. tshal sna ?] Village.   

**Q:**  Where is Tshena located?   

**A:**  Tsena is down there on the other side of the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. རམ་མ་སྒང] A ferry site on the Lhasa River south of Lhasa City.">Ramagang</a> [Tib. ར་མ་གང] ferry port and the lower part of the Shungsep [Tib. shug gsep]   

**Q:**  Was that a <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཆོས་གཤིས] A &quot;religious&quot; estate held by a monastery or lama.">chöshi</a> (monastic estate) of <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. རྣམ་རྒྱལ] 1. A person&#x27;s name. 2. The name of the Dalai Lama&#x27;s monastery located in the Potala Palace [tib. rnam rgyal grwa tshamg].">Namgyal</a> Tratsang?   

**A:**  Yes. From our village, we had to pay the yearly <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. རྩམ་པ] The traditional Tibetan staple food that consists of grain that is roasted (popped), usually in heated sand, and then ground into a flour.">tsamba</a> salary to the monks of the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. རྣམ་རྒྱལ] 1.

The name of the Dalai Lama&#x27;s monastery located in the Potala Palace [tib. rnam rgyal grwa tshamg].">Namgyal</a> Monastery. There were 175 monks in Namgyal Monastery and we had to pay three bo [Tib. འབོ] of <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. རྩམ་པ] The traditional Tibetan staple food that consists of grain that is roasted (popped), usually in heated sand, and then ground into a flour.">tsamba</a> for each monk in a year.   

**Q:**  In a year?   

**A:**  Yes, in a year.   

**Q:**  Did they collect grain from every family?   

**A:**  No. They didn't have to collect the grain. Each family would bring about 50 or 100 bo according to the size of their fields.   

**Q:**  Did they lump all the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. རྩམ་པ] The traditional Tibetan staple food that consists of grain that is roasted (popped), usually in heated sand, and then ground into a flour.">tsamba</a> together?   

**A:**  No. we had to take them by ourselves. Before we made the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. རྩམ་པ] The traditional Tibetan staple food that consists of grain that is roasted (popped), usually in heated sand, and then ground into a flour.">tsamba</a>, we have to clean up the grain very well, so it should be without a single stone in it. We separated just the white barleys and soaked it in hot water and then roasted it and made tsamba. When they checked whether the tsamba was good enough to pay for the monks, they would make a <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. གཏོར་མ] A ritual offering made from tsamba and water.">torma</a> (a religious offering) and keep it over night. On the next day, if there no crack appeared on it, it would be qualified for distribution among the monks.

Generally, donggos had associated endowments that monks used by turns to fund a donggo. The monk with the donggo obligation would lend out the capital of the endowment and pay for the event from the interest he collected.

**A:**  The <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. གཉེར་ཚང] 1. Storehouse. 2. Steward, person in charge of a storehouse. 3. A monastic official in charge of storerooms.">nyertsang</a> had to ask <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཕྱག་སྦུག] A manager (of estates and endowments) of a monastic college or monastic khamtsen.">chabu</a> whatever they needed.   

**Q:**  What if <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. སྦུག་མཛོད] A manager/steward who was in charge of the estates of a monastery or monastic college.">bungdzö</a> (a type of steward) needed something, who did he have to ask to?   

**A:**  The <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. སྦུག་མཛོད] A manager/steward who was in charge of the estates of a monastery or monastic college.">bungdzö</a> also needed to ask the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཕྱག་སྦུག] A manager (of estates and endowments) of a monastic college or monastic khamtsen.">chabu</a> for whatever the college (tratsang) needed. Then the chabu would order the gegö.   

**Q:**  Did the Bungdzö have the right to order the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. དགེ་སྐོས] The main disciplinary official in a monastic college (tratsang).">gegö</a>?   

**A:**  No, they didn't.   

**Q:**  Are you sure about that?

**Q:**  For example, if the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. སྦུག་མཛོད] A manager/steward who was in charge of the estates of a monastery or monastic college.">bungdzö</a> received many skin-bag of butter, then did the bungdzö have to ask the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཕྱག་སྦུག] A manager (of estates and endowments) of a monastic college or monastic khamtsen.">chabu</a> to send some monks to collecting those or was the bungdzö allowed to directly ask the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. དགེ་སྐོས] The main disciplinary official in a monastic college (tratsang).">gegö</a>?   

**A:**  It was okay if the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. སྦུག་མཛོད] A manager/steward who was in charge of the estates of a monastery or monastic college.">bungdzö</a> directly asked the gegö.   

**Q:**  Then it was not necessary to ask the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཕྱག་སྦུག] A manager (of estates and endowments) of a monastic college or monastic khamtsen.">chabu</a>?

Don't provoke them, but if they provoke you, you are not allowed to except defeat. If you except defeat in fighting, you would get a penalty from your tobtsang. If you have any problem, the tobtsang will take care of you. Now, we became members of the tobtsang.   

**Q:**  What did you have to do after you got admitted into the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ལྟོ་ཚང] 1. The club of the Dobdos. 2. A group of people eating together.">tobtsang</a>?   

**A:**  We had to practice every month.   

**Q:**  Did you feel yourself that you belonged to the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ལྟོ་ཚང] 1. The club of the Dobdos. 2. A group of people eating together.">tobtsang</a> and felt proud of it?   

**A:**  Yes, we felt proud and we had to practice the sports for many years. We had to practice on alternative days for a long time. During the winter, we had to practice early in the morning and in the evening; twice a day everyday.   

**Q:**  How long did it take when you practiced sports in the morning?   

**A:**  We have to go just before day break.   

**Q:**  All the members of the toptsang, 25 or 26 persons would be coming for the practice?   

**A:**  Yes, they would. They had made a drain with falling water from the rock and we had to take a bath in winter.   

**Q:**  So that was before daybreak?   

**A:**  First you have to take a shower and the belt of your underpants would freeze and you had to run on sand which reached up to the waist. It was very hard and everybody was sweating a lot.   

**Q:**  If you couldn't run in the sand, did they beat you?   

**A:**  No, they didn't, but the seniors would be sitting in a corner watching us.   

**Q:**  What if one couldn't run in the sand?   

**A:**  Then they just have to try it again.   

**Q:**  Where would the seniors be sitting?   

**A:**  The senior would be watching from the corner and he would teach us how to run and how to lift up our feet. Some of them would put sand in the monk's boot called resom [Tib. རས་ཟོན] and practice running.   

**Q:**  That was the practice for jumping right?   

**A:**  Yes. In the evening at the place called Nam Thangkhuk [Tib. གནམ་ཐང་ཁུག] which was located in the orchard called Phodrang Jangsep [Tib. ཕོ་བྲང་ལྕང་གསེབ], there was a platform there that was almost two storys high where a person would stand down and stretch his arms upwards and a person would stretch his arms from the top and both the hands would hardly touch. You have to be able to jump from that height on the pile of sand. If you couldn't jump on that sand, you will land on the hard soil and few people broke their legs but not many people.   

**Q:**  Then, if you break your leg, you wouldn't be able to do anything?   

**A:**  The Tobtsang would be taking care of you if you had broken your leg. Because the platform was so high, when you land on the hard soil your heel will get kind of smashed and then we had to take rest for 2 or 3 days.   

**Q:**  Was there any way of recovering it from it?   

**A:**  Yes, it would be recovered if they massage with warm oil.   

**Q:**  Where did you practice dokor [Tib. རྡོ་སྒོར], throwing round rocks?   

**A:**  Dobdos had 12 different kinds of sports.   

**Q:**  Let's count those 12 different sports starting from the 4 different jumps.   

**A:**  Four round of jumps [Tib. མཆོང་སྐོར], 2 Kyangdo, [Tib. རྐྱང་རྡོ] throwing stone, 2 mando [Tib. མན་རྡོ], throwing stones while lifting arms, 2 <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. རྒྱབ་རྡོ] A sports competition of dobdo monks that involved throwing a large stone backwards over their heads to see who threw it the furthest.">gyabdo</a> [Tib. རྒྱ་རྡོ] throwing stones from behind, 2 kupdo [Tib. rkup rdo] throwing stone from back side while standing on the platform on your big toes.   

**Q:**  Where did you have to go to practice dokor?   

**A:**  We would practice all 12 sports. When we practice, first we practice the 4 jumps and then start the kyangdo. They wrapped the rock with a peace of cloth and put it on the platform and serve a wooden bowl of tea to us which is called kyangja [Tib. བརྐྱངས་ཇ].   

**Q:**  Was the rock very precious? From where did they get the rock?   

**A:**  We have to make it.   

**Q:**  Were there people making this rock?   

**A:**  Yes, we have to order the mason specially to make it, and the rock should be hard and heavy. There were some rocks that were small but very heavy. If there were 20 people who came for practicing, we would be divided in two groups of 10 each and we would bet.   

**Q:**  What did they bet?   

**A:**  They bet to serve tea and the food where dough is mixed with melted and dry cheese and sugar (called Baktsha Marku [Tib. བག་ཚ་མར་ཁུ]) was served. Mostly they bet Baktsha Marku. The one who lost, had to prepare a large house where the food would be served. When they bet tea, we called the betting tea gyenja [Tib. རྒྱན་ཇ]. It should be very thick with lots of butter in it. If you put a <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཏམ་ཀ་དཀར་པོ] A unit in the traditional Tibetan currency system that was equal to 4 sang. Also a silver coin.">trangga garpo</a> on the grease of the tea, it should not sink. Some people would be nasty and put a trangga garpo on the grease and if it would sink in the tea they would make you put some more butter in it. It was a very happy time and lots of fun, but we didn't get any education.   

**Q:**  Did they treat the toptsang kids with leniency when the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. གྲྭ་ཚང] A &quot;college&quot; within a monastery, for example, in Drepung Monastery there were four main tratsang: Gomang, Loseling, Deyang and Ngagpa. These tratsang were property owning corporate entities and included monks who were organized into residential dormitories called Khamtsen.">tratsang</a> would have to punish them?   

**A:**  Yes, they did that a little bit.   

**Q:**  Did the officials treat you a little bit nicer?   

**A:**  Yes, they did, If not, it would be difficult if the kids misbehaved because there were about hundred toptsang kids.   

**Q:**  In the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. བློ་གསལ་གླིང] One of the main colleges in Drepung Monastery.">Loseling</a> tobtsang, there were almost 100 kids right?   

**A:**  Yes, there were more then 100.   

**Q:**  In the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ལྟོ་ཚང] 1. The club of the Dobdos. 2. A group of people eating together.">tobtsang</a> in <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. བློ་གསལ་གླིང] One of the main colleges in Drepung Monastery.">Loseling</a>, from every khamtshen the monks would come to join it, right? Were there monks from the far away places like Khampas?   

**A:**  Yes, except for those from Triu [Tib. ཏྲེ་ཧོར] and Minyak [Tib. མི་ཉག].   

**Q:**  The monks from Triu wouldn't join in the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ལྟོ་ཚང] 1. The club of the Dobdos. 2. A group of people eating together.">tobtsang</a> because their discipline was too strict, right?   

**A:**  Yes.   

**Q:**  So why didn't the Minyag monks join?   

**A:**  Most of the monks were <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. དཔེ་ཆ་བ] A monk studying the monastic philosophical curriculum. A scholar monk.">pechawa</a> and even though they were <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. གྲྭ་རྒྱུན] Monks who came to Drepung, Ganden and Sera from far distances such as Kham and Amdo.">tragyün</a> (monks from far away), they wouldn't join in the tobtsang. There were monks from Nyarel [Tib. ཉང་རལ] who joined in the tobtsang. From all the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཁང་ཚན] A monastic residential unit in which monks from specific geographic areas lived. These were corporate entities with property and internal officials. Some large khamtsen had smaller subordinate units called mi tshan. Khamtsen were part of tratsang (colleges). For example, Hamdong Khamtsen was part of Gomang College in Drepung Monastery.">khamtsen</a> there were about 3-4 monks joining and there was also some from <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. རྒྱལ་རོང] A Khamtsen in Drepung Monastery.">Gyerong</a> [Tib. རྒྱལ་རོང].   

**Q:**  Were there monks from Phara [Tib. ཕ་ར] <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཁམས་པ] A person from the Kham region, a Tibetan from the Khampa (Khamba) sub-cultural group.">Khampa</a>?   

**A:**  No, there weren't.   

**Q:**  Were there any from Gowo [Tib. གོ་བོ]?   

**A:**  Yes, there were 4 monks from Gowo. They were nicknamed the "thin <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཆོས་མཛད] The title of monks who made a payment or gave gifts to secure exemption from the normal &quot;young monk&quot; work obligations. There were tratsang chöndze and khamtsen chöndze.">chöndze</a>" (Chöndze Kampo [Tib. སྐམ་པོ]) and they were from Lhasa.   

**Q:**  Did the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ལྟོ་ཚང] 1. The club of the Dobdos. 2. A group of people eating together.">tobtsang</a> help you if you become poor and you don't have anything to eat?   

**A:**  Yes, they will help you. For example, in summer we often go for picnics. The poor persons didn't have to bring anything and the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ལྟོ་ཚང] 1. The club of the Dobdos. 2. A group of people eating together.">tobtsang</a> would give them everything.   

**Q:**  This was given from the toptsang in common?   

**A:**  Yes, all the foodstuffs are piled up there and you have to take whatever you want. There were many donors from Lhasa and they would serve the food.   

**Q:**  Who was going to search for the donors?   

**A:**  During the Mönlam, two senior leaders of <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ལྟོ་ཚང] 1. The club of the Dobdos. 2. A group of people eating together.">tobtsang</a> and the best in the sports would go to search for the donors in Lhasa.   

**Q:**  Usually there were 4 seniors in the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ལྟོ་ཚང] 1. The club of the Dobdos. 2. A group of people eating together.">tobtsang</a>?   

**A:**  If your <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ལྟོ་ཚང] 1. The club of the Dobdos. 2. A group of people eating together.">tobtsang</a> is good, then you can have one senior, <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. རྒན་འགོ] The head of the dobdo&#x27;s organization when they did &quot;sports&quot; competitions.">gengo</a> [Tib. རྒན་འགོ] if not you have two. There were some rich <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. རྩེ་དྲུང] A monk official in the Tibetan government.">tsidrung</a> and the monks from <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. རྨེ་རུ] Name of a monastery in the northern part of Lhasa.">Muru</a> [Tib. རྨེ་རུ] and <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. བཞི་སྡེ] The monastery/labrang of Reting Rimpoche in Lhasa.">Shide</a> [Tib. བཞི་སྡེ] would be the donors. Some of them would become donors voluntarily. Some of them would say we would like to come to watch your sport, then we had to invite them. The donors would be sitting at the right and left side of platform. When we jumped, the donors were watching us like this when we swayed our legs in the space.   

**Q:**  How would you sway your legs?   

**A:**  I have to sway my legs like riding a bicycle just before I reach the landing place I have to stretch my legs. This is called drerug and when we do this we have to bend down our body and the next is called Kangkor [Tib. རྐང་སྐོར] and Kanguk [Tib. རྐང་གུག]. The most skilled person would take off their blessing ribbon on the platform by putting their legs in the ribbon. It was the most exciting one and their body should be very flexible to be able to bend through the blessing ribbon.   

**Q:**  Where did you have to go to throw the Gyabdo?   

**A:**  All of these would be thrown from the same platform and you have to hold the stone with only three fingers when you throw Kyangdo, and with some persons the rock would slip and they would drop the rock. You have to run while holding the stone and you have to walk backwards as soon as you threw the stone. Some of them would jump just after they threw it. The Sera kids would throw the Kyangdo, but Drepung wouldn't.   

**Q:**  You had to jump without walking backward, right?   

**A:**  Yes.   

**Q:**  You are allowed to do that?   

**A:**  Yes, allowed, because we had to show different skills to the donors, one person had to throw Kyangdo twice, you would lose if your rock fell behind at the space of a needle's eye. They would measure the place with the size of the needle. Then you have to throw Mando and Kupdo and when you throw the Gyabdo, we have to go down there and pile up the earth and you have to stand on your toes and throw it while turning your body around.   

**Q:**  Did the sponsors give anything to the best players?   

**A:**  Yes, they would give prizes.   

**Q:**  What prize they would give?   

**A:**  They would give underpants, shamthab and vests (töngag [Tib. སྟོད་འགག]). Some of them would accept to be the sponsor and give clothes. If they give money, we have to give it to the toptsang in common.   

**Q:**  Did the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ལྟོ་ཚང] 1. The club of the Dobdos. 2. A group of people eating together.">tobtsang</a> common have quite a lot of money?   

**A:**  Yes, they had a lot of money.   

**Q:**  What did they do with the money?   

**A:**  They lend it to get the interest.   

**Q:**  Did the senior toptsang do this?   

**A:**  Yes, they would appoint 5 people who consisted of the seniors and other wealthy persons. Some of them entered the toptsang even though they never competed, because dobdos were happy-go-lucky and they were kind of engrossed with sports. Those people had to do the work, like making tea and cooking food. Nyare Atsara [Tib. ཉག་རེ་ཧིན་ཨ་ཅར་ར] was there too.   

**Q:**  Did he do the geyok [Tib. དགེ་གཡོག] later?   

**A:**  Yes, he did. The lama, <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. སྐུ་ཞབས] A respectful term of address usually for monks, but also to show respect to a layman.">Kusho</a> Mani [Tib. སྐུ་ཞབས་མ་ནི] helped them so much when it was the time for the jumping competition with Sera. It would be our turn right after they were done. Kusho Mani was the donor and made the iron daggers/pegs [Tib. ལྕགས་ཕུར] for the tents. Before that, we didn't have the iron daggers/pegs. Later, it was taken up by the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. གྲྭ་ཚང] A &quot;college&quot; within a monastery, for example, in Drepung Monastery there were four main tratsang: Gomang, Loseling, Deyang and Ngagpa. These tratsang were property owning corporate entities and included monks who were organized into residential dormitories called Khamtsen.">tratsang</a> and put it in the chapel of the protective deities (Gonkhang [Tib. མགོན་ཁང]) of the tratsang. Kusho Mani had ordered them to make one of the small images on the iron daggers/pegs that looks like Nyare Atsara, because he was an expert in all 12 kinds of sports. Kusho Mani's <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. དགེ་ཕྲུག] 1. Student. 2. Disciple. 3. Commonly the name for monks living with a gegen or teacher. These are more like wards than real disciples.">gidru</a> (diciple) nicknamed "hawk" (Pingkuma [Tib. པིང་ཁྱུ་མ]) whose actual name is Lobsang Tashi [Tib. བློ་བཟང་བཀྲ་ཤིས] is in Nepal now. He was not so good in sports and his team lost so they ran away. There was also a <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ལྡབ་ལྡོབ] A mildly deviant type of fighting or &quot;punk&quot; monk who engaged in fighting and other unusual behaviors for monks in traditional Tibet&#x27;s large monasteries.">dobdo</a> in Bompora [Tib. སྤོམ་པོ་ར] Khamtsen called Kyinag [Tib. སྐྱི་ནག] who was from Kyinag. Altogether, there were 4 dobdo in Bompora.   

**Q:**  Did Kyinag run away?   

**A:**  Yes, he did, so the Sera monks composed a song criticizing him: Kyinak came first to get the neck rope. [Tib. སྐྱི་ནག་སྔོན་ལ་ཡོང་ནས། སྐེ་ཐག་གོན་གག་སླེབས་བྱུང]. We had a <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ལྡབ་ལྡོབ] A mildly deviant type of fighting or &quot;punk&quot; monk who engaged in fighting and other unusual behaviors for monks in traditional Tibet&#x27;s large monasteries.">dobdo</a> who was left-handed so they made another verse: [Tib. སྐྱི་ནག་སྔོན་ལ་ཡོང་ནས། སྐེ་ཐག་གོན་གག་སླེབས་བྱུང། ཟ་རུ་གཞུ་གུར་བཞག་ནས། རྟེན་འབྲེལ་མ་ཡག་ཚར་སོང]. "skyinag came first and got the neck rope, the left-handed one was left behind, so there won't be good fortune."   

**Q:**  We heard that Ugyenla [Tib. ཨོ་རྒྱན་ལགས] ran away in a coracle when they lost the game.   

**A:**  Ugyenla had great loyalty to the dobdos and he scolded us and said "what are you people doing?" He used two lines saying, "you didn't know Dharma well when you were left in the mountain regions, and you didn't know how to work when you were in left in the village." [Tib. ཕུ་ལ་བཞག་ན་ཆོས་མི་ཤེས། མདའ་ལ་བཞག་ན་ལས་མི་ཤེས]. The senior leader of the toptsang would send messages saying things like such and such a person should come to the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. གྲྭ་ཚང] A &quot;college&quot; within a monastery, for example, in Drepung Monastery there were four main tratsang: Gomang, Loseling, Deyang and Ngagpa.

For example, providing food and tea for all the monks in one&#x27;s monastic college at a prayer assembly. Or it could be an obligation to give all the monks a set amount of grain or the donggo obligation that many monastery office holders had to do when they left office. Generally, donggos had associated endowments that monks used by turns to fund a donggo. The monk with the donggo obligation would lend out the capital of the endowment and pay for the event from the interest he collected. This was also used for ritual obligations of government offices like the Tseja Office.">donggo</a> ceremony and thugpa had to be served, all the people in the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ལྟོ་ཚང] 1.

A porridge or gruel-like soup typically made with tsamba, and if available, meat and cheese. 2. Noodle dishes in broth.">thukpa</a>. All the ladles had been given to the toptsang, because other monks didn't know very well how to serve, and if you don't know how to serve the thukpa, it would be short. The Toptsang advised us that the thukpa should served evenly and you should serve two ladles and you should not pour out the thukpa and give thukpa to the shameless people who are taking extra shares. You should think that leftovers is same as leftover water and shortage is like being short gold [Tib. ལྷག་ན་ཆུ་ལྷག། ཆད་ན་གསེར་ཆད].   

**Q:**  Did they teach you how to serve the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཐུག་པ] 1. A porridge or gruel-like soup typically made with tsamba, and if available, meat and cheese. 2. Noodle dishes in broth.">thukpa</a>?   

**A:**  Yes. They would tell us it was given by a poor <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. དགེ་ཤེས] An advanced degree earned by scholar monks.">geshe</a>'s donor and should not be wasted. So you had to look in the caldron; that meant we should not serve a lot.   

**Q:**  Would the toptsang senior tell you this evening when you had to serve the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཐུག་པ] 1. A porridge or gruel-like soup typically made with tsamba, and if available, meat and cheese. 2. Noodle dishes in broth.">thukpa</a> tomorrow?

**Q:**  What kind of clothing would the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ལྟོ་ཚང] 1. The club of the Dobdos. 2. A group of people eating together.">tobtsang</a> senior wear?   

**A:**  He would wear the same clothes as other dobdo. Then the senior would go in the assembly hall, the (dukhang [Tib. འདུ་ཁང].

**A:**  It wouldn't be alright if you didn't learn to serve the thukpa. Some of them didn't know how to serve and they hit hard with the ladle on the wooden bowl and almost broke the bowl.   

**Q:**  They would serve <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཐུག་པ] 1. A porridge or gruel-like soup typically made with tsamba, and if available, meat and cheese. 2.

There was a <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཆབ་གཡོག] An assistant or servant of the chabu.">chabyog</a> [Tib. ཆབ་གཡོག] nicknamed "donkey herder" (bungok [Tib. བོང་བུ་བ] because he hit with his stick everywhere on the body.

Then we had to take the thukpa in the kitchen and put it on the fire and had to wash the bucket with water. That's why he was called "Bungkok" When we were running in and out to serve the thukpa, we were touching the ladles of each other to play around as it would make a sound like, "thak thak thak." He would also hit our faces with the stick and make the same sound, "thak thak thak." Therefore, the monks would yell at him in a scolding manner, "Hey bungkok! Don't make the sound thag thag."   

**Q:**  Have you had any fighting experiences?   

**A:**  Yes, I have. One of my opponents was from Drepung Gungru. He is now in the military regiment [in India]. One day, when we were coming back from Lhasa on the Kyangthang <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. རྐང] The basic land measurement unit for tax obligations in the traditional Tibetan society.

I had a long sword kept on my backside and a key which weighed one kg. I purposely ordered this key from the blacksmith in Sera. I was an expert in hitting with the key. If you don't know well how to hit with the key, your key chain would be cut by the knife. Then I told him, "If you want to fight, let's go to a corner to fight."   

**Q:**  What was the reason for fighting?   

**A:**  Both of us were drunk with <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. 1. ཆང, 2. བྱང] 1. Tibetan locally brewed barley beer. 2. North; nomad areas north of Lhasa in Nagchuga Prefecture 3. ch. 厂 factory.">chang</a> beer. He said, "You must think well." He implied that I should surrender. But I wouldn't give up and I told him, "Let's not go on the main road, let's go off to a [remote] corner." I thought of cutting him down at once near the rocks by the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. གནས་ཆུང] 1. One of the main protector deities of the Tibetan government and the Dalai Lama. 2. The monastery in which the medium of Nechung resides that is located just east of Drepung Monastery.">Nechung</a> [Tib. གནས་ཆུང] Monastery. I told him to stop there and then he climbed up on a rock and said, "Don't do this. We don't have any reason, so it is pointless to do this." I said, "That's right. We don't have any reason for fighting, but you are a <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ལྡབ་ལྡོབ] A mildly deviant type of fighting or &quot;punk&quot; monk who engaged in fighting and other unusual behaviors for monks in traditional Tibet&#x27;s large monasteries.">dobdo</a> and I am too and whoever surrenders, it would be shameful, because I am not an ordinary one in <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. བློ་གསལ་གླིང] One of the main colleges in Drepung Monastery.">Loseling</a>" Then I told him let's not fight and we agreed and went back to the monastery. One day, just before the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. སྐུ་རིམ] A religious prayer service for monks.">kurim</a> [Tib. སྐུ་རིམ] ritual session was held, when I went to the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཚོམས་ཇ] A prayer assembly meeting of a Khamtsen at which tea is served to the participating monks.">tshomja</a> (College's Prayer Assembly with tea), I was sitting at the head of a row in our khamtshen. There was a very nervous monk who was serving tea on that day, and he poured the tea carelessly, so I got angry and scolded him, saying, "Don't you know how to serve the tea?" After the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཚོགས] 1. A prayer assembly meeting in monasteries when all the monks come to an assembly hall and chant prayers together. 2. An offering made of tsamba, butter and dry cheese in the shape of a cone.">tsog</a> (Prayer Assembly) was over, he came to my <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. 1. ཤག, 2. ཞག] 1.

If the tea had been made with a lot of butter, this layer could be thick enough to scoop off and save to later sell or eat separately. The senior monks are usually served tea with a lot of shag.">shag</a> (apartment)and said, "Why did you scold me? I want to meet a person like you. Come outside if you have the courage to do so." Then I said, "Are you sure?" He said, "I am sure." So I told him, you can bring weapons if you have any. I don't need weapons for people like you." Actually, I had a short knife which is normally used by the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. བླ་མ་རྒྱུད་པ] The name for the monks enrolled in the Upper and Lower Tantric Monastic Colleges in Lhasa (gyüme and gyütö).">lama gyüpa</a> [Tib. བླ་མ་རྒྱུད་པ] monks and I carried it in my vest, my töngag. Then I took him to the gorge and people saw the two of us fighting. They were watching from the west gate. As soon as we reached there, I seized his chest and stabbed him with the knife and he fell face down. When I pulled out the knife, the handle was in my hand but the knife blade got stuck in his body and he fell down on the ground. I told him, "Now I am going to kill you with a rock by hitting it on your head." He said, "Please don't kill me! Have mercy on me." Then I left him there and returned to my shag. On the way, some monks were shouting from <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. སྡེ་ཡངས] One of the colleges in Drepung Monastery.">Deyang</a>, "Po Tshena [Tib. སྤོ་བོ་ཚལ་སྣ] of Tsethang went to fight and now he might have killed someone down there." They used to call me Po Tshena because I was from the place called Tsena. After some time, he came back and he had become completely yellow (in complection).   

**Q:**  He probably had too much bleeding.   

**A:**  On the next day, he disappeared. Maybe he went to Lhasa, I don't know. I fought like that many times. Once at the door of Tengyeling [Tib. བསྟན་རྒྱས་གླིང] I had been hit with a knife from my back side when I was walking ahead. There was a telegraph office, (tarkhang [Hin. tar Tib. khang]) near Tengyeling. In that area, usually many Sera <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ལྡབ་ལྡོབ] A mildly deviant type of fighting or &quot;punk&quot; monk who engaged in fighting and other unusual behaviors for monks in traditional Tibet&#x27;s large monasteries.">dobdo</a> monks would gather and we had a quarrel on boys [boyfriends]. There were some good boys from Sera [handsome boys]. I had a dobdo friend who liked jumping very much, but he couldn't make good jumps. I went outside with him and all the Sera dobdo monks were drunk inside the house. Then a handsome boy came out to urinate, and I caught him by the hand and took him to the roof of the Tengyeling (Labrang) and stayed there for awhile. The boy told the dobdos on the next day, and they came to take revenge and they said, "You had caught the boy and you did such and such." I said, "Yes, I had to do that, so anyway, I am sorry. Please accept my apology to you." Like this, we could settle things. After two days, when I was going around in the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. བར་སྐོར] The inner circumambulation road that goes around the Tsuglagang (Jokhang) Temple in Lhasa. This circular road was a main market area.">Barkor</a> Street where they sell aluminum pots, I met that dobdo [who had said that to me]. I had no knife but I was carrying the key. It seemed to me that he had a knife. Then when he was looking to the right and left side, I hit him with the key and it made a sound of "seeng." He turned his body twice and fell down on the ground. I ran away at once, since their khamtshen was close by and I thought they will <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. རྐང] The basic land measurement unit for tax obligations in the traditional Tibetan society.

**Q:**  Have you ever been taken to the monastic officials, the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ལས་སྣེ] The general name for all monastic officials.">lene</a> [Tib. ལས་སྣེ], accused of fighting in the monastery?   

**A:**  I never fought in the monastery and have never been to the office.   

**Q:**  Have you ever been to the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. སྣང་རྩེ་ཤག] The main administrative office in Lhasa that was headed by the &quot;mayor&quot; or mipön.">Nangtsesha</a> (Lhasa "mayor's" office) for for fighting in Lhasa or somewhere else outside?   

**A:**  I fought very carefully and have never been to a court of law. Those who have been to the court of law were fighting in the crowd, so they were immediately caught. If you really want to fight, you should fight just as two people, and then you would know who is the winner and who is the loser.   

**Q:**  Oh! The real <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ལྡབ་ལྡོབ] A mildly deviant type of fighting or &quot;punk&quot; monk who engaged in fighting and other unusual behaviors for monks in traditional Tibet&#x27;s large monasteries.">dobdo</a>'s fighting was that they fixed the time and went off to fight; they didn't have any mediators, did they?   

**A:**  No, they didn't need to have mediator because they want one of them to win and the other to lose. If there was fighting among the people, they wouldn't know who won and who lost and then the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཞལ་ངོ] 1. a junior officer in the traditional Tibetan Army in charge of a unit of 25 soldiers (same as dingpön). 2. the two head disciplinary officials for all of Drepung monastery and for the Mönlam Prayer Festival.">sheyngo</a> will catch them.   

**Q:**  How many <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཐབ་གཡོག] Monks or laymen who work as servants/manual laborers in kitchens (normally monastic kitchens).">thabyog</a> were there?   

**A:**  In the past, in our <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. གྲྭ་ཚང] A &quot;college&quot; within a monastery, for example, in Drepung Monastery there were four main tratsang: Gomang, Loseling, Deyang and Ngagpa. These tratsang were property owning corporate entities and included monks who were organized into residential dormitories called Khamtsen.">tratsang</a> there were the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཐབ་གཡོག] Monks or laymen who work as servants/manual laborers in kitchens (normally monastic kitchens).">thabyog</a> and the water carrier, the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཆུ་མ] People whose job it was to fetch water in monasteries or estates.">chuma</a> [Tib. ཆུ་མ], one person called chutsaba , 4 fire makers or metongwa [Tib. མེ་གཏོང་བ], and 24 water carriers. Altogether, there were 25 people.   

**Q:**  Where did they come from?   

**A:**  They came from the same source where the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཚོགས་ཆེན] The main assembly hall of a monastery. The assembly hall for the monastery as a whole.">tsogchen</a> thabyog (kitchen servants) came from. All of them came from Thambag [Tib. དན་འབག] village {situated below Drepung along the road).   

**Q:**  Thambag was not the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. མི་སེར] A term that can mean serf/bound subject as well as citizen, depending on context. For example, the miser of a lord would connote the bound subjects of that lord, whereas the miser of Tibet would connote citizens of Tibet.">miser</a> (subject) of the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. གྲྭ་ཚང] A &quot;college&quot; within a monastery, for example, in Drepung Monastery there were four main tratsang: Gomang, Loseling, Deyang and Ngagpa. These tratsang were property owning corporate entities and included monks who were organized into residential dormitories called Khamtsen.">tratsang</a> (college), so why did they come?   

**A:**  No, no. No matter how much <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. འགྱེ] Alms given to monks.">gye</a> (alms) and tea the monks would get, they would get the same [so it provided income to them]. Beside that, they would get some extra tea and <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཐུག་པ] 1. A porridge or gruel-like soup typically made with tsamba, and if available, meat and cheese. 2. Noodle dishes in broth.">thukpa</a> called tshabsik [Tib. ཚྭ་གཟིགས].   

**Q:**  What is tsabsig?   

**A:**  It was the extra share of tea and thukpa.   

**Q:**  Did they have to deliver it to them?   

**A:**  They would take them home in the evening in buckets.   

**Q:**  Did they have to make a request to be a <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཐབ་གཡོག] Monks or laymen who work as servants/manual laborers in kitchens (normally monastic kitchens).">thabyog</a>?   

**A:**  Yes, they did, because this was the only way of making the living in that village.   

**Q:**  <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. བློ་གསལ་གླིང] One of the main colleges in Drepung Monastery.">Loseling</a> had 25 <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཐབ་གཡོག] Monks or laymen who work as servants/manual laborers in kitchens (normally monastic kitchens).">thabyog</a> so how many did <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. སྒོ་མང] One of the large colleges in Drepung Monastery.">Gomang</a> have?   

**A:**  <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. སྒོ་མང] One of the large colleges in Drepung Monastery.">Gomang</a> probably had many, but <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. སྡེ་ཡངས] One of the colleges in Drepung Monastery.">Deyang</a> had just 5 or 6.   

**Q:**  How many did the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཚོགས་ཆེན] The main assembly hall of a monastery. The assembly hall for the monastery as a whole.">tsogchen</a> (the main assembly hall for the monastery as a whole) have?   

**A:**  The Tsogchen had a lot, but I don't know the exact number. There were 5 people just for carrying the firewood.   

**Q:**  From where did they bring the firewood?   

**A:**  They had to bring it from the firewood-yard, the shingra [Tib. ཤིང་ར], near to the kitchen.   

**Q:**  Where is the firewood-yard?   

**A:**  It was at the back side.   

**Q:**  Was it near the kitchen?   

**A:**  Yes, it was. They had to bring the firewood loaded on oxen as a tax.   

**Q:**  The <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. སྤྱི་བསོ] The head managers/stewards of monasteries as a whole, especially the large Gelugpa monasteries like Sera and Drepung.">jiso</a> (the top business manager) has to prepare the firewood, right?   

**A:**  It was the duty of <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. སྤྱི་བསོ] The head managers/stewards of monasteries as a whole, especially the large Gelugpa monasteries like Sera and Drepung.">jiso</a> to bring the thorn-wood as firewood.   

**Q:**  Then, what would they do with the pile of used tea leaves?   

**A:**  This was very strange, even though they piled up 1 or 2 wooden buckets everyday (of used leaves), but it wouldn't get increased at all.   

**Q:**  Didn't the villagers take them for the purpose of fertilizer on their fields?   

**A:**  No, they didn't. They said if they used them for fertilizer, I heard that the field would get insects. I don't know, maybe they took it after it got dried up. The <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཚོགས་ཆེན] The main assembly hall of a monastery. The assembly hall for the monastery as a whole.">tsogchen</a>'s caldron was put near the used tea leaves.   

**Q:**  You mean nowadays?   

**A:**  Yes.   

**Q:**  Was the pile of used tea leaves there since the beginning of Drepung?   

**A:**  Yes, it was there when we became a monk and it became a little more during the Chamön [Tib. བྱམས་སྨོན] rite.   

**Q:**  Was there a ritual called Chamön?   

**A:**  Yes, it was just before the Tibetan New Year.   

**Q:**  Who would give the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. གཏོང་སྒོ] A monastic obligation to provide the food and other necessary items served at a monastic prayer assembly meeting or some other rite; this was often a required obligation for monastic officials at the end of their term of office.">tonggo</a> for the Chamön?   

**A:**  It would be given by the Drepung jiso.   

**Q:**  Did you work as a <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. སྤྱི་བསོ] The head managers/stewards of monasteries as a whole, especially the large Gelugpa monasteries like Sera and Drepung.">jiso</a> (manager of the Drepung monastery as a whole)?   

**A:**  I have never done it.   

**Q:**  Okay, thank you for taking your time. Please tell me how did <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. རྒྱལ་རོང] A Khamtsen in Drepung Monastery.">Gyerong</a> [Tib. རྒྱལ་རོང] <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. མཁན་པོ] Abbot of a monastery or monastic college.">khembo</a> dismiss the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ལྟོ་ཚང] 1. The club of the Dobdos. 2. A group of people eating together.">tobtsang</a> and when did the tobtsang start in the past?   

**A:**  I don't know when it started. I heard that it was there from the early times. In the past, the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ལྟོ་ཚང] 1. The club of the Dobdos. 2. A group of people eating together.">tobtsang</a> senior told us that he knew about the tobtsang during 3 generations ago. The Tobtsang had a special right and even the government didn't say anything during the Mönlam Festivals if the dobdos would wander around. One day, when all the dobdos had gathered, the (Loseling) <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. རྒྱལ་རོང] A Khamtsen in Drepung Monastery.">Gyerong</a> Khembo said, "You all (all dobdos) have to attend the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཚོག] 1.

A prayer assembly meeting in monasteries when all the monks come to an assembly hall and chant prayers together.">tshog</a> (prayer chanting Assemblies) as well as the chöra. (debating grove)" In our <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. གྲྭ་ཚང] A &quot;college&quot; within a monastery, for example, in Drepung Monastery there were four main tratsang: Gomang, Loseling, Deyang and Ngagpa. These tratsang were property owning corporate entities and included monks who were organized into residential dormitories called Khamtsen.">tratsang</a>, they had the same problem as <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. སྒོ་མང] One of the large colleges in Drepung Monastery.">Gomang</a>'s problem.   

**Q:**  You mean to say the problem in <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. སྒོ་མང] One of the large colleges in Drepung Monastery.">Gomang</a> between the monks who study the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. དཔེ་ཆ] Religious books/texts, scriptures.">pecha</a> (texts) or did not in your <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. གྲྭ་ཚང] A &quot;college&quot; within a monastery, for example, in Drepung Monastery there were four main tratsang: Gomang, Loseling, Deyang and Ngagpa. These tratsang were property owning corporate entities and included monks who were organized into residential dormitories called Khamtsen.">tratsang</a> almost had the same problem right?   

**A:**  Yes.   

**Q:**  How did the problem come about?   

**A:**  The the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. གྲྭ་ཚང] A &quot;college&quot; within a monastery, for example, in Drepung Monastery there were four main tratsang: Gomang, Loseling, Deyang and Ngagpa. These tratsang were property owning corporate entities and included monks who were organized into residential dormitories called Khamtsen.">tratsang</a> khembo (college abbot) said like that.   

**Q:**  What did the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. གྲྭ་ཚང] A &quot;college&quot; within a monastery, for example, in Drepung Monastery there were four main tratsang: Gomang, Loseling, Deyang and Ngagpa. These tratsang were property owning corporate entities and included monks who were organized into residential dormitories called Khamtsen.">tratsang</a> khembo say?   

**A:**  The <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. གྲྭ་ཚང] A &quot;college&quot; within a monastery, for example, in Drepung Monastery there were four main tratsang: Gomang, Loseling, Deyang and Ngagpa. These tratsang were property owning corporate entities and included monks who were organized into residential dormitories called Khamtsen.">tratsang</a> <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. མཁན་པོ] Abbot of a monastery or monastic college.">khembo</a> said, "It is not fair for the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. དཔེ་ཆ་བ] A monk studying the monastic philosophical curriculum. A scholar monk.">pechawa</a> (scholar mon ks) to have to attend the prayer chanting assemblies and <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཆོས་ར] The special grove (&quot;dharma grove&quot;) in monasteries where monks formally met to practice debating.">chöra</a> whereas the dobdos didn't have to, and they were just having picnics all the time. So we should dismiss the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ལྟོ་ཚང] 1. The club of the Dobdos. 2. A group of people eating together.">tobtsang</a> dobdo club." At that time, we received a letter from Sera calling on us to come for the competition of jumping. We told the khembo that we received this letter and we are going to go for the competition. But the khembo wrote a letter to Sera saying we are going to dismiss the tobtsang and you should also dismiss it (in Sera). Sera pretended to agree to that, but in fact they didn't. The khembo insisted that we disband the Tobtsang. When the jumping competition time came, our senior toptsang had already been dismissed. But under that, we were the second tobtsang and we didn't dismiss our tobtsang.   

**Q:**  <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. རྒྱལ་རོང] A Khamtsen in Drepung Monastery.">Gyerong</a> khembo didn't dismiss your <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ལྟོ་ཚང] 1. The club of the Dobdos. 2. A group of people eating together.">tobtsang</a> right?   

**A:**  Yes, because the abbot (khembo) didn't know that there were three <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ལྟོ་ཚང] 1. The club of the Dobdos. 2. A group of people eating together.">tobtsang</a>. He knew that there was only one tobtsang. We had so many good kitchen utensils which were kept in the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. གྲྭ་ཚང] A &quot;college&quot; within a monastery, for example, in Drepung Monastery there were four main tratsang: Gomang, Loseling, Deyang and Ngagpa. These tratsang were property owning corporate entities and included monks who were organized into residential dormitories called Khamtsen.">tratsang</a> gönkhang (the chapel where the protective dities are kept). All of those there belonged to our tobtsang. Things like a very large cooking pot made from copper designed with great wall of China [Tib. རྒྱ་ནག་ལྕགས་རི] around the edge. We purposely ordered a large tent from India along with silk rope and iron pegs. Not only that, but the tobtsang had a large amount of money and when we were having picnic parties, toptsang distributed five <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཞོ] A unit in the traditional Tibetan currency system. 10 sho equaled to 1 sang and 10 karma equaled one sho.">sho</a> [Tib. ཞོ] for each monk in the whole tratsang.   

**Q:**  Did all of you tell the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. མཁན་པོ] Abbot of a monastery or monastic college.">khembo</a>, "Please don't dismiss the tobtsang." when he was insisting that you do so?   

**A:**  Yes, we did.   

**Q:**  He never listen to that?   

**A:**  No. He never listened to us. We explained to him that our <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ལྟོ་ཚང] 1. The club of the Dobdos. 2. A group of people eating together.">tobtsang</a> was doing work because we had loyalty to <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. བློ་གསལ་གླིང] One of the main colleges in Drepung Monastery.">Loseling</a>, and not for the benefit of one or two individuals. So if you dismiss the tobtsang, Loseling Tratsang would get a bad reputation. For example, it is like saying that we only need the ones who study religion and not the picnic parties. As we all know, when Kabshöpa [Tib. ཀ་ཤོད་པ] had given a contribution to make a caldron for Loseling, did the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. དཔེ་ཆ་བ] A monk studying the monastic philosophical curriculum. A scholar monk.">pechawa</a> hold up the caldron? It was we, the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ལྡབ་ལྡོབ] A mildly deviant type of fighting or &quot;punk&quot; monk who engaged in fighting and other unusual behaviors for monks in traditional Tibet&#x27;s large monasteries.">dobdo</a> who held the caldron. And many of our people got injured; some of them had their legs broken. If there were no dobdob, the work couldn't be done. When some of the pechawa went to help the coppersmith, they refused them and asked for the dobdo to help them. The Toptsang kids, the dobdo were stronger than others. So we brought up the caldron to Loseling without demolishing the house. We were in the toptsang for many years, so please let us play (a competition) at least once, and after that we would do whatever you said. After saying that, all the dobdos cried and also said if not, you should expel all of us from the organization. Even though we couldn't do the dharma practice as our parents had wanted us to do, but we wouldn't do something to get a bad reputation for Loseling. We also said to the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. མཁན་པོ] Abbot of a monastery or monastic college.">khembo</a> that if it is in your hands, please expel all of us from the organization now. Then the khembo said, "I couldn't expel you, I am just a khembo, if you don't want to listen to me, you can do as you wish." Then all of us cried. All the pechawa conciliated between the khembo and us. Otherwise, something bad was about to happen. It was summer, so most of the tobtsang members were in the villages. If it had been in winter when all the Dobdo members were there, we would have finished off the khembo. [Tib. ཏག་ཏག་བཟོས]   

**Q:**  Yes, they would beat the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. མཁན་པོ] Abbot of a monastery or monastic college.">khembo</a> because they also did beat the khembo in Sera?   

**A:**  At that time, Sera asked us, what are you going to do? We will do the same thing as you do. We replied we will do what you want to do. Then we decided to give up during this <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. མཁན་པོ] Abbot of a monastery or monastic college.">khembo</a>. Later, the khembo will be changed.   

**Q:**  At that time, the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. མཁན་པོ] Abbot of a monastery or monastic college.">khembo</a> was Thabkhe La [Tib. ཐབས་མཁས་ལགས], right?   

**A:**  Yes. On the day they dismissed the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ལྟོ་ཚང] 1. The club of the Dobdos. 2. A group of people eating together.">tobtsang</a>, all the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ལྡབ་ལྡོབ] A mildly deviant type of fighting or &quot;punk&quot; monk who engaged in fighting and other unusual behaviors for monks in traditional Tibet&#x27;s large monasteries.">dobdo</a> were wearing their best clothes, and made the (Dobdo style) foldings on the lower robes, applied soot on their faces, kept their beards and sat on the top floor of the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. གྲྭ་ཚང] A &quot;college&quot; within a monastery, for example, in Drepung Monastery there were four main tratsang: Gomang, Loseling, Deyang and Ngagpa. These tratsang were property owning corporate entities and included monks who were organized into residential dormitories called Khamtsen.">tratsang</a>. All the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. དཔེ་ཆ་བ] A monk studying the monastic philosophical curriculum. A scholar monk.">pechawa</a> sat down there and they felt so sad saying, "poor dobdos"! Until now they were in picnic parties and they had to do whatever work there was in the tratsang like pounding Arka earth (for roofs), carrying big stones and they built a well-known stove for Loseling. Now we really feel mercy for them." We were told that the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. དགེ་སྐོས] The main disciplinary official in a monastic college (tratsang).">gegö</a> disciplinary official also felt sad about it.   

**Q:**  Who was the Gegö? Maybe he was also a <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ལྟོ་ཚང] 1. The club of the Dobdos. 2. A group of people eating together.">tobtsang</a> member.   

**A:**  He was from <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. གཙང] One of the major sub-areas of Tibet that is located in southwest Tibet. Its main city is Shigatse.">Tsang</a> [Tib. གཙང] and he was kind of short, He was the gegö. Then the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ལྟོ་ཚང] 1. The club of the Dobdos. 2. A group of people eating together.">tobtsang</a> was dismissed, and after that we rose against them.   

**Q:**  Did you?   

**A:**  Yes, we did. One winter day, they summoned us and said, "the toptsang had already been dismissed, now what are you doing? We said, "We are assisting the toptsang and we have been serving the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. གྲྭ་ཚང] A &quot;college&quot; within a monastery, for example, in Drepung Monastery there were four main tratsang: Gomang, Loseling, Deyang and Ngagpa. These tratsang were property owning corporate entities and included monks who were organized into residential dormitories called Khamtsen.">tratsang</a> (college). When the senior <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ལྟོ་ཚང] 1. The club of the Dobdos. 2. A group of people eating together.">tobtsang</a> was dismissed, there was nobody working for the tratsang. We would like to serve the tratsang and let others pratcice the dharma." However, we were not allowed to remain and we were told, "Now you all have been punished and each of you have to bring 300 baskets of Arka earth. I was told about that because I wasn't there at that time. I had gone to Kongpo.   

**Q:**  Why did you go to Kongpo?   

**A:**  I went there for trading. Then they refused this and they told the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. མཁན་པོ] Abbot of a monastery or monastic college.">khembo</a>, "Please come and check our <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. 1. ཤག, 2. ཞག] 1. The apartment/room of a monk. 2. The butter fat that coagulates on the top of butter-tea when the tea is left to sit for some time. If the tea had been made with a lot of butter, this layer could be thick enough to scoop off and save to later sell or eat separately. The senior monks are usually served tea with a lot of shag.">shag</a> (apartments); we don't have anything; we need to have enough to eat when we go to dig and bringing up the Arka earth. We also need sacks to put the earth in. We even didn't have a pot of water in our shag. Please come and check. The <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. གྲྭ་ཚང] A &quot;college&quot; within a monastery, for example, in Drepung Monastery there were four main tratsang: Gomang, Loseling, Deyang and Ngagpa. These tratsang were property owning corporate entities and included monks who were organized into residential dormitories called Khamtsen.">tratsang</a> had confiscated all the kitchen utensils and even a shovel and pick-ax when they destroyed the toptsang." Anyway, we were just ignored. Then the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ལྡབ་ལྡོབ] A mildly deviant type of fighting or &quot;punk&quot; monk who engaged in fighting and other unusual behaviors for monks in traditional Tibet&#x27;s large monasteries.">dobdo</a> nicknamed "leopard cub" or siktruk [Tib. གཟིག་ཕྲུག] and some of the other dobdo studied pecha. I was called to the tratsang as soon as I returned from Kongpo.   

**Q:**  Who came to call you?   

**A:**  Some one was sent from the khamtsen. However, my name was already in their hands (the abbot's). At that time, I shaved my beard this much long. As soon as I entered in the office, the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. མཁན་པོ] Abbot of a monastery or monastic college.">khembo</a> asked me, "Are you the Tsethang Dobdo?" I said, "Yes." Then he said, "Look at you! "What do you look like with this beard?" I didn't say anything, but took off my shawl and stood there with my head bent down. Then he said, "From tomorrow you have to bring Arka earth and work on the upper floor of the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. གྲྭ་ཚང] A &quot;college&quot; within a monastery, for example, in Drepung Monastery there were four main tratsang: Gomang, Loseling, Deyang and Ngagpa. These tratsang were property owning corporate entities and included monks who were organized into residential dormitories called Khamtsen.">tratsang</a> by yourself." I promised roughly, because I had many donkeys so I thought I could load the donkeys. When I got back down there, all of them were saying you shouldn't have promised to accept the punishment. So on the next day, I went to the khembo and I said, "Please forgive me, but I can't do this." The khembo said, "No, that won't be okay." Then I said, "I just want to be expelled from the kyidu." Then he said, "You will be whipped with switches tomorrow." I said I had decided to do as you say." Then I went back and told the others that the khembo ordered the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. དགེ་སྐོས] The main disciplinary official in a monastic college (tratsang).">gegö</a> to whip me with switches 300 times tomorrow. The next day, I cut my hair little bit shorter, because I had to go into the prayer assembly hall, the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. འདུ་ཁང] An assembly hall in a monastery.">dukhang</a> [Tib. འདུ་ཁང]. Friends of mine said, "Don't worry and go and get the whipping ewith the switches and if you need to, then go to <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. བདེ་སྐྱིད་གླིང་ག] The name of the British Indian government&#x27;s Bureau Office in Lhasa. After Indian independence, the Indian government continued to operate the office using the same name until 1954 when it became an Indian government consulate.">Dekyilinga</a> [Tib. བདེ་སྐྱིད་གླིང་ཁ] (the Indian governmnet's office which had a doctor and a dispensary). We all will help you. All of the 25 <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ལྡབ་ལྡོབ] A mildly deviant type of fighting or &quot;punk&quot; monk who engaged in fighting and other unusual behaviors for monks in traditional Tibet&#x27;s large monasteries.">dobdo</a> gathered and they told the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཐབ་གཡོག] Monks or laymen who work as servants/manual laborers in kitchens (normally monastic kitchens).">thabyog</a>, "All of us will come to the outside door of the dukhang and we will be watching when you hit whip him with the switches. If you make even a small wound on his buttocks, we will kill you in Thambag [Tib. དན་འབག] village along the road (where the thabyog live)." Therefore, even one thabyog didn't dare to come to hit him. At that time, a man brought about 20-30 switches of one meter length and piled them on two sides (of me). I told the man who was holding my head to hold it tightly and told the feet holder to hold them straight. I thought it would hurt because I had never gotten whipped before. I thought that there is no choice but to get it. Some of my friends used to get hit with the switches and they taught me how to bear it better.   

**Q:**  What did they teach you?   

**A:**  Because we were wearing the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ལྡབ་ལྡོབ] A mildly deviant type of fighting or &quot;punk&quot; monk who engaged in fighting and other unusual behaviors for monks in traditional Tibet&#x27;s large monasteries.">dobdo</a>'s lower robe, shamthab [Tib. གཤམ་ཐབ], they taught me to fold the robe and pull it up and put it at one side of the buttocks, so the switches would hit on the ground on the other side and on this side would be hit on the robe mostly and won't get hit much on the buttocks. On the next day, the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. དགེ་སྐོས] The main disciplinary official in a monastic college (tratsang).">gegö</a> told the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཐབ་གཡོག] Monks or laymen who work as servants/manual laborers in kitchens (normally monastic kitchens).">thabyog</a> to bring me inside to the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. མཁན་པོ] Abbot of a monastery or monastic college.">khembo</a> before they whbipped me with switches.   

**Q:**  I think the monks who whip with the switches might have told the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. མཁན་པོ] Abbot of a monastery or monastic college.">khembo</a>, right?   

**A:**  On the next day, between the first and second tea of the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཚོགས] 1. A prayer assembly meeting in monasteries when all the monks come to an assembly hall and chant prayers together. 2. An offering made of tsamba, butter and dry cheese in the shape of a cone.">tsog</a> (Pprayer assembly), I was told to prostrate at the front row.   

**Q:**  Now was there no whipping with switches?   

**A:**  Yes, there was no whipping with switches. I was sitting at the edge of the row. It was a special tea offering that day that was given by a <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. སྤྲུལ་སྐུ] An incarnate lama.">trüku</a> incarnation and I told one of the tea servers to bring the tea quickly to me. The tea was full of grease and I ate <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. སྤགས] A staple Tibetan dish of tsampa mixed with tea and kneaded into balls of dough-like consistency.">pag</a> (kneaded tsamba) with it. Then the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. དགེ་སྐོས] The main disciplinary official in a monastic college (tratsang).">gegö</a> was calling me.   

**Q:**  Did he call your name?   

**A:**  He called from my name because he knew where I was. He yelled at me and said, "Get up, get up and come here! You Tsetang Dobdo!" All the monks were looking at me and I was embarrassed and pretended to be doing something behind the pillar and was moving very slowly towards him. When I came closer, the umdze named Drubtho la [Tib. སྒྲུབ་ཐོབ་ལགས] who was from Guge [Tib. གུ་གེ] had already started the prayer and I didn't have to prostrate. The <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. དགེ་སྐོས] The main disciplinary official in a monastic college (tratsang).">gegö</a> was just watching and didn't say anything. But, when we went to get the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. འགྱེ] Alms given to monks.">gye</a> (alms), the gegö said, "you incorrigible [Tib. རྫབ་ཆེན] guy. Why didn't you come when I called you. Anyway, I am sparing your life today" The <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཆབ་རིལ] The Chabril&#x27;s main work was overseeing serving the traja. He was also the servant of the gegö and khempo. It had a middle status of the types of lene. The chabril was also the one responsible for beating the gong at the tsog and chöra. The chabril got an extra share of gye in the tratsang.">chabril</a> was laughing.   

**Q:**  Did the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. མཁན་པོ] Abbot of a monastery or monastic college.">khembo</a> say anything later?   

**A:**  He didn't say anything.   

**Q:**  Did he think that you had prostrated? Didn't he see it?   

**A:**  The <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. མཁན་པོ] Abbot of a monastery or monastic college.">khembo</a> was inside the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. འདུ་ཁང] An assembly hall in a monastery.">dukhang</a>, he had probably forgotten it.   

**Q:**  When the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. དགེ་སྐོས] The main disciplinary official in a monastic college (tratsang).">gegö</a> called you, didn't the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. མཁན་པོ] Abbot of a monastery or monastic college.">khembo</a> see you?   

**A:**  He wouldn't see me, because I was sitting in the edge of the row. Everyone was laughing at me. The prayers had started, before I reached there.   

**Q:**  Nothing happened afterwards?   

**A:**  Later, we had intended to establish the toptsang again, but it wasn't allowed to because <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཆུ་བཞི་སྒང་དྲུག] The anti-Chinese Khamba insurgency force in Tibet that began in 1957 in Lhasa and launched an uprising against the Chinese the following year. The name means, &quot;four rivers and six mountain ranges,&quot; and refers to Eastern Tibet.">Chushigandru</a> had already been started. Then I stayed in the monastery for quite awhile and then I went to join Chushigandru.
