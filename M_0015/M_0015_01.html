<p><strong>Q:</strong>  In the past, you were in the monastery?   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  Yes.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  When we were in the monastery, there were four monks in your family?   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  Yes.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  The first was the ex-khembo of the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. &#xF66;&#xFA1;&#xF7A;&#xF0B;&#xF61;&#xF44;&#xF66;] One of the colleges in Drepung Monastery.">Deyang</a> College; his name is Sipo right?   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  Yes.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  Who was the second?   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  The second one was <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. &#xF66;&#xFA1;&#xF7A;&#xF0B;&#xF61;&#xF44;&#xF66;] One of the colleges in Drepung Monastery.">Deyang</a> Gusho [Tib. &#xF66;&#xF90;&#xF74;&#xF0B;&#xF42;&#xF64;&#xF7C;&#xF42;&#xF66;].   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  Is he your relative?   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  Yes. Another one was Khyenrab [Tib. &#xF58;&#xF41;&#xFB1;&#xF7A;&#xF53;&#xF0B;&#xF62;&#xF56;] who has the good voice in chanting (d&#xF6;nsang [Tib. &#xF60;&#xF51;&#xF7C;&#xF53;&#xF0B;&#xF56;&#xF5F;&#xF44;]) in the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. &#xF42;&#xFB2;&#xFAD;&#xF0B;&#xF5A;&#xF44;] A &quot;college&quot; within a monastery, for example, in Drepung Monastery there were four main tratsang: Gomang, Loseling, Deyang and Ngagpa. These tratsang were property owning corporate entities and included monks who were organized into residential dormitories called Khamtsen.">tratsang</a> (college). He and Nyare Amcho [Tib. &#xF49;&#xF42;&#xF0B;&#xF62;&#xF7A;&#xF0B;&#xF68;&#xF0B;&#xF58;&#xF46;&#xF7C;&#xF51;] were the same period as me and all together we had 4.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  You were the smallest, right?   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  Yes.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  When did you enter the monastery?   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  I entered the monastery when I was 4 years old.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  How did you come to <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. &#xF56;&#xFB3;&#xF7C;&#xF0B;&#xF42;&#xF66;&#xF63;&#xF0B;&#xF42;&#xFB3;&#xF72;&#xF44;] One of the main colleges in Drepung Monastery.">Loseling</a>?   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  At first, I entered in <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. &#xF66;&#xFA1;&#xF7A;&#xF0B;&#xF61;&#xF44;&#xF66;] One of the colleges in Drepung Monastery.">Deyang</a> at the age of 4 and I was there for one year. Khyenrab [Tib. &#xF58;&#xF41;&#xFB1;&#xF7A;&#xF53;&#xF0B;&#xF62;&#xF56;] has taken me to Loseling.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  So at that time, Khyenrab is already in <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. &#xF56;&#xFB3;&#xF7C;&#xF0B;&#xF42;&#xF66;&#xF63;&#xF0B;&#xF42;&#xFB3;&#xF72;&#xF44;] One of the main colleges in Drepung Monastery.">Loseling</a>, right?   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  Khyenrab was a senior monk of <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. &#xF56;&#xFB3;&#xF7C;&#xF0B;&#xF42;&#xF66;&#xF63;&#xF0B;&#xF42;&#xFB3;&#xF72;&#xF44;] One of the main colleges in Drepung Monastery.">Loseling</a> and he entered long time ago.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  He is a senior monk, but who was the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. &#xF58;&#xF41;&#xF53;&#xF0B;&#xF54;&#xF7C;] Abbot of a monastery or monastic college.">khembo</a>?   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  When I first joined the monastery, the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. &#xF58;&#xF41;&#xF53;&#xF0B;&#xF54;&#xF7C;] Abbot of a monastery or monastic college.">khembo</a> is Lhopa [Tib. &#xF63;&#xFB7;&#xF7C;&#xF0B;&#xF54;].   </p>

A group of people eating together.">tobtsang</a> has very strict discipline.

A group of people eating together.">tobtsang</a> and there were 25 of us and we joined the tobtsang. Then we have to give one <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. &#xF41;&#xF0B;&#xF56;&#xF4F;&#xF42;&#xF66;] A Tibetan ceremonial scarf given to lamas, visitors, etc.">khata</a> and one <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. &#xF4F;&#xF58;&#xF0B;&#xF40;] A unit in the traditional Tibetan currency system that was equal to 4 sang.">tranka</a> to the senior of the tobtsang. The tobtsang had a large box for keeping money and documents. We had to take off the monks lower garment, shamthab [Tib. &#xF42;&#xF64;&#xF58;&#xF0B;&#xF50;&#xF56;] and wear only the vest and the underpants and stand in a line. After all of us gathered, we had to recite the prayer for burning incense called Namdag Ch&#xF6;ku [Tib. &#xF62;&#xFA3;&#xF58;&#xF0B;&#xF51;&#xF42;&#xF0B;&#xF46;&#xF7C;&#xF66;&#xF0B;&#xF66;&#xF90;&#xF74;] and then they would serve the tea.

If you have any trouble, the tobtsang in common would help you. You should not fight, in case you have to fight you would never be alone, the tobtsang will support you, so you shouldn&apos;t be scared. Don&apos;t provoke them, but if they provoke you, you are not allowed to except defeat. If you except defeat in fighting, you would get a penalty from your tobtsang. If you have any problem, the tobtsang will take care of you. Now, we became members of the tobtsang.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  What did you have to do after you got admitted into the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. &#xF63;&#xF9F;&#xF7C;&#xF0B;&#xF5A;&#xF44;] 1. The club of the Dobdos. 2. A group of people eating together.">tobtsang</a>?   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  We had to practice every month.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  Did you feel yourself that you belonged to the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. &#xF63;&#xF9F;&#xF7C;&#xF0B;&#xF5A;&#xF44;] 1. The club of the Dobdos. 2. A group of people eating together.">tobtsang</a> and felt proud of it?   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  Yes, we felt proud and we had to practice the sports for many years. We had to practice on alternative days for a long time. During the winter, we had to practice early in the morning and in the evening; twice a day everyday.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  How long did it take when you practiced sports in the morning?   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  We have to go just before day break.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  All the members of the toptsang, 25 or 26 persons would be coming for the practice?   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  Yes, they would. They had made a drain with falling water from the rock and we had to take a bath in winter.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  So that was before daybreak?   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  First you have to take a shower and the belt of your underpants would freeze and you had to run on sand which reached up to the waist. It was very hard and everybody was sweating a lot.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  If you couldn&apos;t run in the sand, did they beat you?   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  No, they didn&apos;t, but the seniors would be sitting in a corner watching us.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  What if one couldn&apos;t run in the sand?   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  Then they just have to try it again.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  Where would the seniors be sitting?   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  The senior would be watching from the corner and he would teach us how to run and how to lift up our feet. Some of them would put sand in the monk&apos;s boot called resom [Tib. &#xF62;&#xF66;&#xF0B;&#xF5F;&#xF7C;&#xF53;] and practice running.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  That was the practice for jumping right?   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  Yes. In the evening at the place called Nam Thangkhuk [Tib. &#xF42;&#xF53;&#xF58;&#xF0B;&#xF50;&#xF44;&#xF0B;&#xF41;&#xF74;&#xF42;] which was located in the orchard called Phodrang Jangsep [Tib. &#xF55;&#xF7C;&#xF0B;&#xF56;&#xFB2;&#xF44;&#xF0B;&#xF63;&#xF95;&#xF44;&#xF0B;&#xF42;&#xF66;&#xF7A;&#xF56;], there was a platform there that was almost two storys high where a person would stand down and stretch his arms upwards and a person would stretch his arms from the top and both the hands would hardly touch. You have to be able to jump from that height on the pile of sand. If you couldn&apos;t jump on that sand, you will land on the hard soil and few people broke their legs but not many people.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  Then, if you break your leg, you wouldn&apos;t be able to do anything?   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  The Tobtsang would be taking care of you if you had broken your leg. Because the platform was so high, when you land on the hard soil your heel will get kind of smashed and then we had to take rest for 2 or 3 days.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  Was there any way of recovering it from it?   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  Yes, it would be recovered if they massage with warm oil.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  Where did you practice dokor [Tib. &#xF62;&#xFA1;&#xF7C;&#xF0B;&#xF66;&#xF92;&#xF7C;&#xF62;], throwing round rocks?   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  Dobdos had 12 different kinds of sports.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  Let&apos;s count those 12 different sports starting from the 4 different jumps.   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  Four round of jumps [Tib. &#xF58;&#xF46;&#xF7C;&#xF44;&#xF0B;&#xF66;&#xF90;&#xF7C;&#xF62;], 2 Kyangdo, [Tib. &#xF62;&#xF90;&#xFB1;&#xF44;&#xF0B;&#xF62;&#xFA1;&#xF7C;] throwing stone, 2 mando [Tib. &#xF58;&#xF53;&#xF0B;&#xF62;&#xFA1;&#xF7C;], throwing stones while lifting arms, 2 <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. &#xF62;&#xF92;&#xFB1;&#xF56;&#xF0B;&#xF62;&#xFA1;&#xF7C;] A sports competition of dobdo monks that involved throwing a large stone backwards over their heads to see who threw it the furthest.">gyabdo</a> [Tib. &#xF62;&#xF92;&#xFB1;&#xF0B;&#xF62;&#xFA1;&#xF7C;] throwing stones from behind, 2 kupdo [Tib. rkup rdo] throwing stone from back side while standing on the platform on your big toes.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  Where did you have to go to practice dokor?   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  We would practice all 12 sports. When we practice, first we practice the 4 jumps and then start the kyangdo. They wrapped the rock with a peace of cloth and put it on the platform and serve a wooden bowl of tea to us which is called kyangja [Tib. &#xF56;&#xF62;&#xF90;&#xFB1;&#xF44;&#xF66;&#xF0B;&#xF47;].   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  Was the rock very precious? From where did they get the rock?   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  We have to make it.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  Were there people making this rock?   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  Yes, we have to order the mason specially to make it, and the rock should be hard and heavy. There were some rocks that were small but very heavy. If there were 20 people who came for practicing, we would be divided in two groups of 10 each and we would bet.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  What did they bet?   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  They bet to serve tea and the food where dough is mixed with melted and dry cheese and sugar (called Baktsha Marku [Tib. &#xF56;&#xF42;&#xF0B;&#xF5A;&#xF0B;&#xF58;&#xF62;&#xF0B;&#xF41;&#xF74;]) was served. Mostly they bet Baktsha Marku. The one who lost, had to prepare a large house where the food would be served. When they bet tea, we called the betting tea gyenja [Tib. &#xF62;&#xF92;&#xFB1;&#xF53;&#xF0B;&#xF47;]. It should be very thick with lots of butter in it. If you put a <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. &#xF4F;&#xF58;&#xF0B;&#xF40;&#xF0B;&#xF51;&#xF40;&#xF62;&#xF0B;&#xF54;&#xF7C;] A unit in the traditional Tibetan currency system that was equal to 4 sang. Also a silver coin.">trangga garpo</a> on the grease of the tea, it should not sink. Some people would be nasty and put a trangga garpo on the grease and if it would sink in the tea they would make you put some more butter in it. It was a very happy time and lots of fun, but we didn&apos;t get any education.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  Did they treat the toptsang kids with leniency when the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. &#xF42;&#xFB2;&#xFAD;&#xF0B;&#xF5A;&#xF44;] A &quot;college&quot; within a monastery, for example, in Drepung Monastery there were four main tratsang: Gomang, Loseling, Deyang and Ngagpa. These tratsang were property owning corporate entities and included monks who were organized into residential dormitories called Khamtsen.">tratsang</a> would have to punish them?   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  Yes, they did that a little bit.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  Did the officials treat you a little bit nicer?   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  Yes, they did, If not, it would be difficult if the kids misbehaved because there were about hundred toptsang kids.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  In the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. &#xF56;&#xFB3;&#xF7C;&#xF0B;&#xF42;&#xF66;&#xF63;&#xF0B;&#xF42;&#xFB3;&#xF72;&#xF44;] One of the main colleges in Drepung Monastery.">Loseling</a> tobtsang, there were almost 100 kids right?   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  Yes, there were more then 100.   </p>

<p><strong>A:</strong>  Yes.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  So why didn&apos;t the Minyag monks join?   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  Most of the monks were <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. &#xF51;&#xF54;&#xF7A;&#xF0B;&#xF46;&#xF0B;&#xF56;] A monk studying the monastic philosophical curriculum. A scholar monk.">pechawa</a> and even though they were <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. &#xF42;&#xFB2;&#xFAD;&#xF0B;&#xF62;&#xF92;&#xFB1;&#xF74;&#xF53;] Monks who came to Drepung, Ganden and Sera from far distances such as Kham and Amdo.">tragy&#xFC;n</a> (monks from far away), they wouldn&apos;t join in the tobtsang. There were monks from Nyarel [Tib. &#xF49;&#xF44;&#xF0B;&#xF62;&#xF63;] who joined in the tobtsang. From all the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. &#xF41;&#xF44;&#xF0B;&#xF5A;&#xF53;] A monastic residential unit in which monks from specific geographic areas lived. These were corporate entities with property and internal officials. Some large khamtsen had smaller subordinate units called mi tshan. Khamtsen were part of tratsang (colleges). For example, Hamdong Khamtsen was part of Gomang College in Drepung Monastery.">khamtsen</a> there were about 3-4 monks joining and there was also some from <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. &#xF62;&#xF92;&#xFB1;&#xF63;&#xF0B;&#xF62;&#xF7C;&#xF44;] A Khamtsen in Drepung Monastery.">Gyerong</a> [Tib. &#xF62;&#xF92;&#xFB1;&#xF63;&#xF0B;&#xF62;&#xF7C;&#xF44;].   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  Were there monks from Phara [Tib. &#xF55;&#xF0B;&#xF62;] <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. &#xF41;&#xF58;&#xF66;&#xF0B;&#xF54;] A person from the Kham region, a Tibetan from the Khampa (Khamba) sub-cultural group.">Khampa</a>?   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  No, there weren&apos;t.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  Were there any from Gowo [Tib. &#xF42;&#xF7C;&#xF0B;&#xF56;&#xF7C;]?   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  Yes, there were 4 monks from Gowo. They were nicknamed the &quot;thin <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. &#xF46;&#xF7C;&#xF66;&#xF0B;&#xF58;&#xF5B;&#xF51;] The title of monks who made a payment or gave gifts to secure exemption from the normal &quot;young monk&quot; work obligations. There were tratsang ch&#xF6;ndze and khamtsen ch&#xF6;ndze.">ch&#xF6;ndze</a>&quot; (Ch&#xF6;ndze Kampo [Tib. &#xF66;&#xF90;&#xF58;&#xF0B;&#xF54;&#xF7C;]) and they were from Lhasa.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  Did the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. &#xF63;&#xF9F;&#xF7C;&#xF0B;&#xF5A;&#xF44;] 1. The club of the Dobdos. 2. A group of people eating together.">tobtsang</a> help you if you become poor and you don&apos;t have anything to eat?   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  Yes, they will help you. For example, in summer we often go for picnics. The poor persons didn&apos;t have to bring anything and the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. &#xF63;&#xF9F;&#xF7C;&#xF0B;&#xF5A;&#xF44;] 1. The club of the Dobdos. 2. A group of people eating together.">tobtsang</a> would give them everything.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  This was given from the toptsang in common?   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  Yes, all the foodstuffs are piled up there and you have to take whatever you want. There were many donors from Lhasa and they would serve the food.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  Who was going to search for the donors?   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  During the M&#xF6;nlam, two senior leaders of <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. &#xF63;&#xF9F;&#xF7C;&#xF0B;&#xF5A;&#xF44;] 1. The club of the Dobdos. 2. A group of people eating together.">tobtsang</a> and the best in the sports would go to search for the donors in Lhasa.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  Usually there were 4 seniors in the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. &#xF63;&#xF9F;&#xF7C;&#xF0B;&#xF5A;&#xF44;] 1. The club of the Dobdos. 2. A group of people eating together.">tobtsang</a>?   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  If your <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. &#xF63;&#xF9F;&#xF7C;&#xF0B;&#xF5A;&#xF44;] 1. The club of the Dobdos. 2. A group of people eating together.">tobtsang</a> is good, then you can have one senior, <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. &#xF62;&#xF92;&#xF53;&#xF0B;&#xF60;&#xF42;&#xF7C;] The head of the dobdo&apos;s organization when they did &quot;sports&quot; competitions.">gengo</a> [Tib. &#xF62;&#xF92;&#xF53;&#xF0B;&#xF60;&#xF42;&#xF7C;] if not you have two. There were some rich <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. &#xF62;&#xFA9;&#xF7A;&#xF0B;&#xF51;&#xFB2;&#xF74;&#xF44;] A monk official in the Tibetan government.">tsidrung</a> and the monks from <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. &#xF62;&#xFA8;&#xF7A;&#xF0B;&#xF62;&#xF74;] Name of a monastery in the northern part of Lhasa.">Muru</a> [Tib. &#xF62;&#xFA8;&#xF7A;&#xF0B;&#xF62;&#xF74;] and <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. &#xF56;&#xF5E;&#xF72;&#xF0B;&#xF66;&#xFA1;&#xF7A;] The monastery/labrang of Reting Rimpoche in Lhasa.">Shide</a> [Tib. &#xF56;&#xF5E;&#xF72;&#xF0B;&#xF66;&#xFA1;&#xF7A;] would be the donors. Some of them would become donors voluntarily. Some of them would say we would like to come to watch your sport, then we had to invite them. The donors would be sitting at the right and left side of platform. When we jumped, the donors were watching us like this when we swayed our legs in the space.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  How would you sway your legs?   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  I have to sway my legs like riding a bicycle just before I reach the landing place I have to stretch my legs. This is called drerug and when we do this we have to bend down our body and the next is called Kangkor [Tib. &#xF62;&#xF90;&#xF44;&#xF0B;&#xF66;&#xF90;&#xF7C;&#xF62;] and Kanguk [Tib. &#xF62;&#xF90;&#xF44;&#xF0B;&#xF42;&#xF74;&#xF42;]. The most skilled person would take off their blessing ribbon on the platform by putting their legs in the ribbon. It was the most exciting one and their body should be very flexible to be able to bend through the blessing ribbon.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  Where did you have to go to throw the Gyabdo?   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  All of these would be thrown from the same platform and you have to hold the stone with only three fingers when you throw Kyangdo, and with some persons the rock would slip and they would drop the rock. You have to run while holding the stone and you have to walk backwards as soon as you threw the stone. Some of them would jump just after they threw it. The Sera kids would throw the Kyangdo, but Drepung wouldn&apos;t.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  You had to jump without walking backward, right?   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  Yes.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  You are allowed to do that?   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  Yes, allowed, because we had to show different skills to the donors, one person had to throw Kyangdo twice, you would lose if your rock fell behind at the space of a needle&apos;s eye. They would measure the place with the size of the needle. Then you have to throw Mando and Kupdo and when you throw the Gyabdo, we have to go down there and pile up the earth and you have to stand on your toes and throw it while turning your body around.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  Did the sponsors give anything to the best players?   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  Yes, they would give prizes.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  What prize they would give?   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  They would give underpants, shamthab and vests (t&#xF6;ngag [Tib. &#xF66;&#xF9F;&#xF7C;&#xF51;&#xF0B;&#xF60;&#xF42;&#xF42;]). Some of them would accept to be the sponsor and give clothes. If they give money, we have to give it to the toptsang in common.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  Did the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. &#xF63;&#xF9F;&#xF7C;&#xF0B;&#xF5A;&#xF44;] 1. The club of the Dobdos. 2. A group of people eating together.">tobtsang</a> common have quite a lot of money?   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  Yes, they had a lot of money.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  What did they do with the money?   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  They lend it to get the interest.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  Did the senior toptsang do this?   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  Yes, they would appoint 5 people who consisted of the seniors and other wealthy persons. Some of them entered the toptsang even though they never competed, because dobdos were happy-go-lucky and they were kind of engrossed with sports. Those people had to do the work, like making tea and cooking food. Nyare Atsara [Tib. &#xF49;&#xF42;&#xF0B;&#xF62;&#xF7A;&#xF0B;&#xF67;&#xF72;&#xF53;&#xF0B;&#xF68;&#xF0B;&#xF45;&#xF62;&#xF0B;&#xF62;] was there too.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  Did he do the geyok [Tib. &#xF51;&#xF42;&#xF7A;&#xF0B;&#xF42;&#xF61;&#xF7C;&#xF42;] later?   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  Yes, he did. The lama, <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. &#xF66;&#xF90;&#xF74;&#xF0B;&#xF5E;&#xF56;&#xF66;] A respectful term of address usually for monks, but also to show respect to a layman.">Kusho</a> Mani [Tib. &#xF66;&#xF90;&#xF74;&#xF0B;&#xF5E;&#xF56;&#xF66;&#xF0B;&#xF58;&#xF0B;&#xF53;&#xF72;] helped them so much when it was the time for the jumping competition with Sera. It would be our turn right after they were done. Kusho Mani was the donor and made the iron daggers/pegs [Tib. &#xF63;&#xF95;&#xF42;&#xF66;&#xF0B;&#xF55;&#xF74;&#xF62;] for the tents. Before that, we didn&apos;t have the iron daggers/pegs. Later, it was taken up by the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. &#xF42;&#xFB2;&#xFAD;&#xF0B;&#xF5A;&#xF44;] A &quot;college&quot; within a monastery, for example, in Drepung Monastery there were four main tratsang: Gomang, Loseling, Deyang and Ngagpa. These tratsang were property owning corporate entities and included monks who were organized into residential dormitories called Khamtsen.">tratsang</a> and put it in the chapel of the protective deities (Gonkhang [Tib. &#xF58;&#xF42;&#xF7C;&#xF53;&#xF0B;&#xF41;&#xF44;]) of the tratsang. Kusho Mani had ordered them to make one of the small images on the iron daggers/pegs that looks like Nyare Atsara, because he was an expert in all 12 kinds of sports.

He was not so good in sports and his team lost so they ran away. There was also a <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. &#xF63;&#xFA1;&#xF56;&#xF0B;&#xF63;&#xFA1;&#xF7C;&#xF56;] A mildly deviant type of fighting or &quot;punk&quot; monk who engaged in fighting and other unusual behaviors for monks in traditional Tibet&apos;s large monasteries.">dobdo</a> in Bompora [Tib. &#xF66;&#xFA4;&#xF7C;&#xF58;&#xF0B;&#xF54;&#xF7C;&#xF0B;&#xF62;] Khamtsen called Kyinag [Tib. &#xF66;&#xF90;&#xFB1;&#xF72;&#xF0B;&#xF53;&#xF42;] who was from Kyinag. Altogether, there were 4 dobdo in Bompora.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  Did Kyinag run away?   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  Yes, he did, so the Sera monks composed a song criticizing him: Kyinak came first to get the neck rope. [Tib. &#xF66;&#xF90;&#xFB1;&#xF72;&#xF0B;&#xF53;&#xF42;&#xF0B;&#xF66;&#xF94;&#xF7C;&#xF53;&#xF0B;&#xF63;&#xF0B;&#xF61;&#xF7C;&#xF44;&#xF0B;&#xF53;&#xF66;&#xF0D; &#xF66;&#xF90;&#xF7A;&#xF0B;&#xF50;&#xF42;&#xF0B;&#xF42;&#xF7C;&#xF53;&#xF0B;&#xF42;&#xF42;&#xF0B;&#xF66;&#xFB3;&#xF7A;&#xF56;&#xF66;&#xF0B;&#xF56;&#xFB1;&#xF74;&#xF44;].

<p><strong>A:</strong>  Ugyenla had great loyalty to the dobdos and he scolded us and said &quot;what are you people doing?&quot; He used two lines saying, &quot;you didn&apos;t know Dharma well when you were left in the mountain regions, and you didn&apos;t know how to work when you were in left in the village.&quot; [Tib. &#xF55;&#xF74;&#xF0B;&#xF63;&#xF0B;&#xF56;&#xF5E;&#xF42;&#xF0B;&#xF53;&#xF0B;&#xF46;&#xF7C;&#xF66;&#xF0B;&#xF58;&#xF72;&#xF0B;&#xF64;&#xF7A;&#xF66;&#xF0D; &#xF58;&#xF51;&#xF60;&#xF0B;&#xF63;&#xF0B;&#xF56;&#xF5E;&#xF42;&#xF0B;&#xF53;&#xF0B;&#xF63;&#xF66;&#xF0B;&#xF58;&#xF72;&#xF0B;&#xF64;&#xF7A;&#xF66;].

Generally, donggos had associated endowments that monks used by turns to fund a donggo.

Then we had to take the thukpa in the kitchen and put it on the fire and had to wash the bucket with water. That&apos;s why he was called &quot;Bungkok&quot; When we were running in and out to serve the thukpa, we were touching the ladles of each other to play around as it would make a sound like, &quot;thak thak thak.&quot; He would also hit our faces with the stick and make the same sound, &quot;thak thak thak.&quot; Therefore, the monks would yell at him in a scolding manner, &quot;Hey bungkok! Don&apos;t make the sound thag thag.&quot;   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  Have you had any fighting experiences?   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  Yes, I have. One of my opponents was from Drepung Gungru. He is now in the military regiment [in India].

I had a long sword kept on my backside and a key which weighed one kg. I purposely ordered this key from the blacksmith in Sera. I was an expert in hitting with the key. If you don&apos;t know well how to hit with the key, your key chain would be cut by the knife. Then I told him, &quot;If you want to fight, let&apos;s go to a corner to fight.&quot;   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  What was the reason for fighting?   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  Both of us were drunk with <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. 1. &#xF46;&#xF44;, 2. &#xF56;&#xFB1;&#xF44;] 1. Tibetan locally brewed barley beer. 2.

I told him to stop there and then he climbed up on a rock and said, &quot;Don&apos;t do this. We don&apos;t have any reason, so it is pointless to do this.&quot; I said, &quot;That&apos;s right.

Then I took him to the gorge and people saw the two of us fighting. They were watching from the west gate. As soon as we reached there, I seized his chest and stabbed him with the knife and he fell face down. When I pulled out the knife, the handle was in my hand but the knife blade got stuck in his body and he fell down on the ground. I told him, &quot;Now I am going to kill you with a rock by hitting it on your head.&quot; He said, &quot;Please don&apos;t kill me! Have mercy on me.&quot; Then I left him there and returned to my shag. On the way, some monks were shouting from <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. &#xF66;&#xFA1;&#xF7A;&#xF0B;&#xF61;&#xF44;&#xF66;] One of the colleges in Drepung Monastery.">Deyang</a>, &quot;Po Tshena [Tib. &#xF66;&#xFA4;&#xF7C;&#xF0B;&#xF56;&#xF7C;&#xF0B;&#xF5A;&#xF63;&#xF0B;&#xF66;&#xFA3;] of Tsethang went to fight and now he might have killed someone down there.&quot; They used to call me Po Tshena because I was from the place called Tsena.

<p><strong>A:</strong>  On the next day, he disappeared. Maybe he went to Lhasa, I don&apos;t know. I fought like that many times.

There were some good boys from Sera [handsome boys]. I had a dobdo friend who liked jumping very much, but he couldn&apos;t make good jumps. I went outside with him and all the Sera dobdo monks were drunk inside the house. Then a handsome boy came out to urinate, and I caught him by the hand and took him to the roof of the Tengyeling (Labrang) and stayed there for awhile. The boy told the dobdos on the next day, and they came to take revenge and they said, &quot;You had caught the boy and you did such and such.&quot; I said, &quot;Yes, I had to do that, so anyway, I am sorry. Please accept my apology to you.&quot; Like this, we could settle things.

<p><strong>A:</strong>  The <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. &#xF42;&#xFB2;&#xFAD;&#xF0B;&#xF5A;&#xF44;] A &quot;college&quot; within a monastery, for example, in Drepung Monastery there were four main tratsang: Gomang, Loseling, Deyang and Ngagpa. These tratsang were property owning corporate entities and included monks who were organized into residential dormitories called Khamtsen.">tratsang</a> <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. &#xF58;&#xF41;&#xF53;&#xF0B;&#xF54;&#xF7C;] Abbot of a monastery or monastic college.">khembo</a> said, &quot;It is not fair for the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. &#xF51;&#xF54;&#xF7A;&#xF0B;&#xF46;&#xF0B;&#xF56;] A monk studying the monastic philosophical curriculum. A scholar monk.">pechawa</a> (scholar mon ks) to have to attend the prayer chanting assemblies and <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. &#xF46;&#xF7C;&#xF66;&#xF0B;&#xF62;] The special grove (&quot;dharma grove&quot;) in monasteries where monks formally met to practice debating.">ch&#xF6;ra</a> whereas the dobdos didn&apos;t have to, and they were just having picnics all the time. So we should dismiss the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. &#xF63;&#xF9F;&#xF7C;&#xF0B;&#xF5A;&#xF44;] 1. The club of the Dobdos. 2. A group of people eating together.">tobtsang</a> dobdo club.&quot; At that time, we received a letter from Sera calling on us to come for the competition of jumping. We told the khembo that we received this letter and we are going to go for the competition. But the khembo wrote a letter to Sera saying we are going to dismiss the tobtsang and you should also dismiss it (in Sera). Sera pretended to agree to that, but in fact they didn&apos;t. The khembo insisted that we disband the Tobtsang. When the jumping competition time came, our senior toptsang had already been dismissed. But under that, we were the second tobtsang and we didn&apos;t dismiss our tobtsang.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. &#xF62;&#xF92;&#xFB1;&#xF63;&#xF0B;&#xF62;&#xF7C;&#xF44;] A Khamtsen in Drepung Monastery.">Gyerong</a> khembo didn&apos;t dismiss your <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. &#xF63;&#xF9F;&#xF7C;&#xF0B;&#xF5A;&#xF44;] 1. The club of the Dobdos. 2. A group of people eating together.">tobtsang</a> right?   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  Yes, because the abbot (khembo) didn&apos;t know that there were three <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. &#xF63;&#xF9F;&#xF7C;&#xF0B;&#xF5A;&#xF44;] 1. The club of the Dobdos. 2. A group of people eating together.">tobtsang</a>. He knew that there was only one tobtsang. We had so many good kitchen utensils which were kept in the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. &#xF42;&#xFB2;&#xFAD;&#xF0B;&#xF5A;&#xF44;] A &quot;college&quot; within a monastery, for example, in Drepung Monastery there were four main tratsang: Gomang, Loseling, Deyang and Ngagpa. These tratsang were property owning corporate entities and included monks who were organized into residential dormitories called Khamtsen.">tratsang</a> g&#xF6;nkhang (the chapel where the protective dities are kept). All of those there belonged to our tobtsang. Things like a very large cooking pot made from copper designed with great wall of China [Tib. &#xF62;&#xF92;&#xFB1;&#xF0B;&#xF53;&#xF42;&#xF0B;&#xF63;&#xF95;&#xF42;&#xF66;&#xF0B;&#xF62;&#xF72;] around the edge. We purposely ordered a large tent from India along with silk rope and iron pegs. Not only that, but the tobtsang had a large amount of money and when we were having picnic parties, toptsang distributed five <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. &#xF5E;&#xF7C;] A unit in the traditional Tibetan currency system. 10 sho equaled to 1 sang and 10 karma equaled one sho.">sho</a> [Tib. &#xF5E;&#xF7C;] for each monk in the whole tratsang.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  Did all of you tell the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. &#xF58;&#xF41;&#xF53;&#xF0B;&#xF54;&#xF7C;] Abbot of a monastery or monastic college.">khembo</a>, &quot;Please don&apos;t dismiss the tobtsang.&quot; when he was insisting that you do so?   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  Yes, we did.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  He never listen to that?   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  No. He never listened to us. We explained to him that our <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. &#xF63;&#xF9F;&#xF7C;&#xF0B;&#xF5A;&#xF44;] 1. The club of the Dobdos. 2. A group of people eating together.">tobtsang</a> was doing work because we had loyalty to <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. &#xF56;&#xFB3;&#xF7C;&#xF0B;&#xF42;&#xF66;&#xF63;&#xF0B;&#xF42;&#xFB3;&#xF72;&#xF44;] One of the main colleges in Drepung Monastery.">Loseling</a>, and not for the benefit of one or two individuals. So if you dismiss the tobtsang, Loseling Tratsang would get a bad reputation. For example, it is like saying that we only need the ones who study religion and not the picnic parties. As we all know, when Kabsh&#xF6;pa [Tib. &#xF40;&#xF0B;&#xF64;&#xF7C;&#xF51;&#xF0B;&#xF54;] had given a contribution to make a caldron for Loseling, did the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. &#xF51;&#xF54;&#xF7A;&#xF0B;&#xF46;&#xF0B;&#xF56;] A monk studying the monastic philosophical curriculum. A scholar monk.">pechawa</a> hold up the caldron? It was we, the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. &#xF63;&#xFA1;&#xF56;&#xF0B;&#xF63;&#xFA1;&#xF7C;&#xF56;] A mildly deviant type of fighting or &quot;punk&quot; monk who engaged in fighting and other unusual behaviors for monks in traditional Tibet&apos;s large monasteries.">dobdo</a> who held the caldron. And many of our people got injured; some of them had their legs broken. If there were no dobdob, the work couldn&apos;t be done. When some of the pechawa went to help the coppersmith, they refused them and asked for the dobdo to help them. The Toptsang kids, the dobdo were stronger than others. So we brought up the caldron to Loseling without demolishing the house. We were in the toptsang for many years, so please let us play (a competition) at least once, and after that we would do whatever you said. After saying that, all the dobdos cried and also said if not, you should expel all of us from the organization. Even though we couldn&apos;t do the dharma practice as our parents had wanted us to do, but we wouldn&apos;t do something to get a bad reputation for Loseling. We also said to the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. &#xF58;&#xF41;&#xF53;&#xF0B;&#xF54;&#xF7C;] Abbot of a monastery or monastic college.">khembo</a> that if it is in your hands, please expel all of us from the organization now. Then the khembo said, &quot;I couldn&apos;t expel you, I am just a khembo, if you don&apos;t want to listen to me, you can do as you wish.&quot; Then all of us cried. All the pechawa conciliated between the khembo and us. Otherwise, something bad was about to happen. It was summer, so most of the tobtsang members were in the villages. If it had been in winter when all the Dobdo members were there, we would have finished off the khembo. [Tib. &#xF4F;&#xF42;&#xF0B;&#xF4F;&#xF42;&#xF0B;&#xF56;&#xF5F;&#xF7C;&#xF66;]   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  Yes, they would beat the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. &#xF58;&#xF41;&#xF53;&#xF0B;&#xF54;&#xF7C;] Abbot of a monastery or monastic college.">khembo</a> because they also did beat the khembo in Sera?   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  At that time, Sera asked us, what are you going to do? We will do the same thing as you do. We replied we will do what you want to do. Then we decided to give up during this <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. &#xF58;&#xF41;&#xF53;&#xF0B;&#xF54;&#xF7C;] Abbot of a monastery or monastic college.">khembo</a>. Later, the khembo will be changed.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  At that time, the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. &#xF58;&#xF41;&#xF53;&#xF0B;&#xF54;&#xF7C;] Abbot of a monastery or monastic college.">khembo</a> was Thabkhe La [Tib. &#xF50;&#xF56;&#xF66;&#xF0B;&#xF58;&#xF41;&#xF66;&#xF0B;&#xF63;&#xF42;&#xF66;], right?   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  Yes. On the day they dismissed the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. &#xF63;&#xF9F;&#xF7C;&#xF0B;&#xF5A;&#xF44;] 1. The club of the Dobdos. 2. A group of people eating together.">tobtsang</a>, all the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. &#xF63;&#xFA1;&#xF56;&#xF0B;&#xF63;&#xFA1;&#xF7C;&#xF56;] A mildly deviant type of fighting or &quot;punk&quot; monk who engaged in fighting and other unusual behaviors for monks in traditional Tibet&apos;s large monasteries.">dobdo</a> were wearing their best clothes, and made the (Dobdo style) foldings on the lower robes, applied soot on their faces, kept their beards and sat on the top floor of the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. &#xF42;&#xFB2;&#xFAD;&#xF0B;&#xF5A;&#xF44;] A &quot;college&quot; within a monastery, for example, in Drepung Monastery there were four main tratsang: Gomang, Loseling, Deyang and Ngagpa. These tratsang were property owning corporate entities and included monks who were organized into residential dormitories called Khamtsen.">tratsang</a>. All the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. &#xF51;&#xF54;&#xF7A;&#xF0B;&#xF46;&#xF0B;&#xF56;] A monk studying the monastic philosophical curriculum. A scholar monk.">pechawa</a> sat down there and they felt so sad saying, &quot;poor dobdos&quot;! Until now they were in picnic parties and they had to do whatever work there was in the tratsang like pounding Arka earth (for roofs), carrying big stones and they built a well-known stove for Loseling. Now we really feel mercy for them.&quot; We were told that the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. &#xF51;&#xF42;&#xF7A;&#xF0B;&#xF66;&#xF90;&#xF7C;&#xF66;] The main disciplinary official in a monastic college (tratsang).">geg&#xF6;</a> disciplinary official also felt sad about it.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  Who was the Geg&#xF6;? Maybe he was also a <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. &#xF63;&#xF9F;&#xF7C;&#xF0B;&#xF5A;&#xF44;] 1. The club of the Dobdos. 2. A group of people eating together.">tobtsang</a> member.   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  He was from <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. &#xF42;&#xF59;&#xF44;] One of the major sub-areas of Tibet that is located in southwest Tibet. Its main city is Shigatse.">Tsang</a> [Tib. &#xF42;&#xF59;&#xF44;] and he was kind of short, He was the geg&#xF6;. Then the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. &#xF63;&#xF9F;&#xF7C;&#xF0B;&#xF5A;&#xF44;] 1. The club of the Dobdos. 2. A group of people eating together.">tobtsang</a> was dismissed, and after that we rose against them.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  Did you?   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  Yes, we did. One winter day, they summoned us and said, &quot;the toptsang had already been dismissed, now what are you doing? We said, &quot;We are assisting the toptsang and we have been serving the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. &#xF42;&#xFB2;&#xFAD;&#xF0B;&#xF5A;&#xF44;] A &quot;college&quot; within a monastery, for example, in Drepung Monastery there were four main tratsang: Gomang, Loseling, Deyang and Ngagpa. These tratsang were property owning corporate entities and included monks who were organized into residential dormitories called Khamtsen.">tratsang</a> (college). When the senior <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. &#xF63;&#xF9F;&#xF7C;&#xF0B;&#xF5A;&#xF44;] 1. The club of the Dobdos. 2. A group of people eating together.">tobtsang</a> was dismissed, there was nobody working for the tratsang. We would like to serve the tratsang and let others pratcice the dharma.&quot; However, we were not allowed to remain and we were told, &quot;Now you all have been punished and each of you have to bring 300 baskets of Arka earth. I was told about that because I wasn&apos;t there at that time. I had gone to Kongpo.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  Why did you go to Kongpo?   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  I went there for trading. Then they refused this and they told the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. &#xF58;&#xF41;&#xF53;&#xF0B;&#xF54;&#xF7C;] Abbot of a monastery or monastic college.">khembo</a>, &quot;Please come and check our <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. 1. &#xF64;&#xF42;, 2. &#xF5E;&#xF42;] 1. The apartment/room of a monk. 2. The butter fat that coagulates on the top of butter-tea when the tea is left to sit for some time. If the tea had been made with a lot of butter, this layer could be thick enough to scoop off and save to later sell or eat separately. The senior monks are usually served tea with a lot of shag.">shag</a> (apartments); we don&apos;t have anything; we need to have enough to eat when we go to dig and bringing up the Arka earth. We also need sacks to put the earth in. We even didn&apos;t have a pot of water in our shag. Please come and check. The <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. &#xF42;&#xFB2;&#xFAD;&#xF0B;&#xF5A;&#xF44;] A &quot;college&quot; within a monastery, for example, in Drepung Monastery there were four main tratsang: Gomang, Loseling, Deyang and Ngagpa. These tratsang were property owning corporate entities and included monks who were organized into residential dormitories called Khamtsen.">tratsang</a> had confiscated all the kitchen utensils and even a shovel and pick-ax when they destroyed the toptsang.&quot; Anyway, we were just ignored. Then the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. &#xF63;&#xFA1;&#xF56;&#xF0B;&#xF63;&#xFA1;&#xF7C;&#xF56;] A mildly deviant type of fighting or &quot;punk&quot; monk who engaged in fighting and other unusual behaviors for monks in traditional Tibet&apos;s large monasteries.">dobdo</a> nicknamed &quot;leopard cub&quot; or siktruk [Tib. &#xF42;&#xF5F;&#xF72;&#xF42;&#xF0B;&#xF55;&#xFB2;&#xF74;&#xF42;] and some of the other dobdo studied pecha. I was called to the tratsang as soon as I returned from Kongpo.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  Who came to call you?   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  Some one was sent from the khamtsen. However, my name was already in their hands (the abbot&apos;s). At that time, I shaved my beard this much long. As soon as I entered in the office, the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. &#xF58;&#xF41;&#xF53;&#xF0B;&#xF54;&#xF7C;] Abbot of a monastery or monastic college.">khembo</a> asked me, &quot;Are you the Tsethang Dobdo?&quot; I said, &quot;Yes.&quot; Then he said, &quot;Look at you! &quot;What do you look like with this beard?&quot; I didn&apos;t say anything, but took off my shawl and stood there with my head bent down. Then he said, &quot;From tomorrow you have to bring Arka earth and work on the upper floor of the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. &#xF42;&#xFB2;&#xFAD;&#xF0B;&#xF5A;&#xF44;] A &quot;college&quot; within a monastery, for example, in Drepung Monastery there were four main tratsang: Gomang, Loseling, Deyang and Ngagpa. These tratsang were property owning corporate entities and included monks who were organized into residential dormitories called Khamtsen.">tratsang</a> by yourself.&quot; I promised roughly, because I had many donkeys so I thought I could load the donkeys. When I got back down there, all of them were saying you shouldn&apos;t have promised to accept the punishment. So on the next day, I went to the khembo and I said, &quot;Please forgive me, but I can&apos;t do this.&quot; The khembo said, &quot;No, that won&apos;t be okay.&quot; Then I said, &quot;I just want to be expelled from the kyidu.&quot; Then he said, &quot;You will be whipped with switches tomorrow.&quot; I said I had decided to do as you say.&quot; Then I went back and told the others that the khembo ordered the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. &#xF51;&#xF42;&#xF7A;&#xF0B;&#xF66;&#xF90;&#xF7C;&#xF66;] The main disciplinary official in a monastic college (tratsang).">geg&#xF6;</a> to whip me with switches 300 times tomorrow. The next day, I cut my hair little bit shorter, because I had to go into the prayer assembly hall, the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. &#xF60;&#xF51;&#xF74;&#xF0B;&#xF41;&#xF44;] An assembly hall in a monastery.">dukhang</a> [Tib. &#xF60;&#xF51;&#xF74;&#xF0B;&#xF41;&#xF44;]. Friends of mine said, &quot;Don&apos;t worry and go and get the whipping ewith the switches and if you need to, then go to <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. &#xF56;&#xF51;&#xF7A;&#xF0B;&#xF66;&#xF90;&#xFB1;&#xF72;&#xF51;&#xF0B;&#xF42;&#xFB3;&#xF72;&#xF44;&#xF0B;&#xF42;] The name of the British Indian government&apos;s Bureau Office in Lhasa. After Indian independence, the Indian government continued to operate the office using the same name until 1954 when it became an Indian government consulate.">Dekyilinga</a> [Tib. &#xF56;&#xF51;&#xF7A;&#xF0B;&#xF66;&#xF90;&#xFB1;&#xF72;&#xF51;&#xF0B;&#xF42;&#xFB3;&#xF72;&#xF44;&#xF0B;&#xF41;] (the Indian governmnet&apos;s office which had a doctor and a dispensary). We all will help you. All of the 25 <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. &#xF63;&#xFA1;&#xF56;&#xF0B;&#xF63;&#xFA1;&#xF7C;&#xF56;] A mildly deviant type of fighting or &quot;punk&quot; monk who engaged in fighting and other unusual behaviors for monks in traditional Tibet&apos;s large monasteries.">dobdo</a> gathered and they told the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. &#xF50;&#xF56;&#xF0B;&#xF42;&#xF61;&#xF7C;&#xF42;] Monks or laymen who work as servants/manual laborers in kitchens (normally monastic kitchens).">thabyog</a>, &quot;All of us will come to the outside door of the dukhang and we will be watching when you hit whip him with the switches. If you make even a small wound on his buttocks, we will kill you in Thambag [Tib. &#xF51;&#xF53;&#xF0B;&#xF60;&#xF56;&#xF42;] village along the road (where the thabyog live).&quot; Therefore, even one thabyog didn&apos;t dare to come to hit him. At that time, a man brought about 20-30 switches of one meter length and piled them on two sides (of me). I told the man who was holding my head to hold it tightly and told the feet holder to hold them straight. I thought it would hurt because I had never gotten whipped before. I thought that there is no choice but to get it. Some of my friends used to get hit with the switches and they taught me how to bear it better.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  What did they teach you?   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  Because we were wearing the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. &#xF63;&#xFA1;&#xF56;&#xF0B;&#xF63;&#xFA1;&#xF7C;&#xF56;] A mildly deviant type of fighting or &quot;punk&quot; monk who engaged in fighting and other unusual behaviors for monks in traditional Tibet&apos;s large monasteries.">dobdo</a>&apos;s lower robe, shamthab [Tib. &#xF42;&#xF64;&#xF58;&#xF0B;&#xF50;&#xF56;], they taught me to fold the robe and pull it up and put it at one side of the buttocks, so the switches would hit on the ground on the other side and on this side would be hit on the robe mostly and won&apos;t get hit much on the buttocks. On the next day, the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. &#xF51;&#xF42;&#xF7A;&#xF0B;&#xF66;&#xF90;&#xF7C;&#xF66;] The main disciplinary official in a monastic college (tratsang).">geg&#xF6;</a> told the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. &#xF50;&#xF56;&#xF0B;&#xF42;&#xF61;&#xF7C;&#xF42;] Monks or laymen who work as servants/manual laborers in kitchens (normally monastic kitchens).">thabyog</a> to bring me inside to the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. &#xF58;&#xF41;&#xF53;&#xF0B;&#xF54;&#xF7C;] Abbot of a monastery or monastic college.">khembo</a> before they whbipped me with switches.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  I think the monks who whip with the switches might have told the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. &#xF58;&#xF41;&#xF53;&#xF0B;&#xF54;&#xF7C;] Abbot of a monastery or monastic college.">khembo</a>, right?   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  On the next day, between the first and second tea of the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. &#xF5A;&#xF7C;&#xF42;&#xF66;] 1.

<p><strong>Q:</strong>  Now was there no whipping with switches?   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  Yes, there was no whipping with switches. I was sitting at the edge of the row. It was a special tea offering that day that was given by a <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. &#xF66;&#xFA4;&#xFB2;&#xF74;&#xF63;&#xF0B;&#xF66;&#xF90;&#xF74;] An incarnate lama.">tr&#xFC;ku</a> incarnation and I told one of the tea servers to bring the tea quickly to me. The tea was full of grease and I ate <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. &#xF66;&#xFA4;&#xF42;&#xF66;] A staple Tibetan dish of tsampa mixed with tea and kneaded into balls of dough-like consistency.">pag</a> (kneaded tsamba) with it.

<p><strong>Q:</strong>  Did he call your name?   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  He called from my name because he knew where I was. He yelled at me and said, &quot;Get up, get up and come here! You Tsetang Dobdo!&quot; All the monks were looking at me and I was embarrassed and pretended to be doing something behind the pillar and was moving very slowly towards him. When I came closer, the umdze named Drubtho la [Tib. &#xF66;&#xF92;&#xFB2;&#xF74;&#xF56;&#xF0B;&#xF50;&#xF7C;&#xF56;&#xF0B;&#xF63;&#xF42;&#xF66;] who was from Guge [Tib. &#xF42;&#xF74;&#xF0B;&#xF42;&#xF7A;] had already started the prayer and I didn&apos;t have to prostrate.

<p><strong>Q:</strong>  Did the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. &#xF58;&#xF41;&#xF53;&#xF0B;&#xF54;&#xF7C;] Abbot of a monastery or monastic college.">khembo</a> say anything later?   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  He didn&apos;t say anything.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  Did he think that you had prostrated? Didn&apos;t he see it?   </p>

<p><strong>A:</strong>  He wouldn&apos;t see me, because I was sitting in the edge of the row. Everyone was laughing at me. The prayers had started, before I reached there.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  Nothing happened afterwards?   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  Later, we had intended to establish the toptsang again, but it wasn&apos;t allowed to because <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. &#xF46;&#xF74;&#xF0B;&#xF56;&#xF5E;&#xF72;&#xF0B;&#xF66;&#xF92;&#xF44;&#xF0B;&#xF51;&#xFB2;&#xF74;&#xF42;] The anti-Chinese Khamba insurgency force in Tibet that began in 1957 in Lhasa and launched an uprising against the Chinese the following year.
