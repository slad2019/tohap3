**Q:**  Tell me about how were you recognized as an reincarnation of Chödrak? When you were recognized as a <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. སྤྲུལ་སྐུ] An incarnate lama.">trüku</a> how old were you? When did you join in Drepung and how did you come to Drepung and tell me the story?   

**A:**  The fourth recarnation of Chödrak counting backwards from me was known as Chödrak Trigen Rimpoche [Tib. ཁྲི་རྒན་རིན་པོ་ཆེ] and the people in Traya were very grateful to him. He found the Gyüdra Tömey [Tib. rgyud dgrwa stod smad] monasteries/colleges in Traya and lived until his 60s. He was very successful and gave many teachings in Traya. Joge lama Yeshe Wangdrak [Tib. འཇོ་དགེ་བླ་མ་ཡེ་ཤེས་དབང་གྲགས] was one of his disciples. In Joge hermitage, there was a statue of Trigen Rimpoche. His reincarnation died in the monastery when he was 22 years old. He and the tutor to the Dalai Lama, Kyabje Ling Rimpoche [Tib. སྐྱབ་རྗེ་གླིང་རིན་པོ་ཆེ] were in the same grade. The reincarnation died from arthritis. Between that, there was one lama who they took to the monastery and he died on the way when he was very young. I think he was three years old. After that, I was born. When I was a baby, they took care of me.   

**Q:**  How did they do that?   

**A:**  My parents told me that usually in our house, one of the Nyingma [Tib. རྙིང་མ] Lamas who is from Gonjo [Tib. གོ་འཇོ] would come to our house every year to perform the yearly ritual. One year, he told the household to keep his drum and said, "Keep this drum for me. I won't be using this drum for a quite while." My mother told me that on the day I was born, the water boiling on the stove turned white like milk. When I was born, it was winter. When the nomads went to fetch water they found that there were three yellow flowers on the surface of water. After that, my mother had labor pains and just before I was born, the drum made a sound by itself. This is what I heard from my parents. After that, Gonjo Dronden [Tib. འགྲོ་འདྲེན] Monastery said that I was the reincarnation of their late lama because the lama gave the drum to our household and some other reasons. The <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཕྱག་མཛོད] A senior manager/treasurer of an aristocratic or monastic estate, or the senior manager/treasurer of an aristocratic family or a monastic unit. Generally chandzö handled both internal and external issues and were considered higher in power and status than nyerpa (stewards), who typically only handled the storerooms.">chandzö</a> of the Chödrak Labrang [Tib. བླ་བྲང] said according to the divination of the Lama Yeshe Wangdrak [Tib. ཡེ་ཤེས་དབང་གྲགས ] and Ari Rimpoche, I was the reincarnation of Chödrak Rimpoche and my mother and I were brought to the Labrang by force. In the meanwhile, the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. བླ་བྲང] 1. The property/wealth owning corporate entity of an incarnate lama. 2. The property/wealth owning corporate entity of the Panchen Lama.">labrang</a> submitted a report asking for divination by the regent, and they sent a representative of their Labrang to Lhasa. Until that representative came back, they kept me and my mother like hiding us in the labrang. However, if my mother stayed with me, there was nobody working at home, so from my infancy, my servant named Sögyal [Tib. བསོད་རྒྱལ] took care of me like my mother. I remember these things a little bit. After they received the order from the government approving me as the reincarnation of Chödrak, they took care of me. Otherwise, I would have become a Nyingma Lama.   

**Q:**  If you were a Gelugpa Lama, when you lost your celibacy, then people will look down on you but if you were a Nyingma then it doesn't matter, right?   

**A:**  Yes. I stayed in the Labrang since my childhood. Then I went to see the Joge Lama Rimpoche and he is the one who cut the tuft of my hair that is left on my shaved head for becoming a monk [Tib. སྐྲ་འཕུད]. And the Lama Arab Rinpoche gave me the name Thutob Tenzin [Tib. མཐུ་བསྟོབ་བསྟན་འཛིན]. I think I was 4-5 years old then. They said that I need a <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. དཔེ་ཆའི་དགེ་རྒན] A monk who teaches reading religious texts.">pecha gegen</a> (teacher for reading texts) and they asked for the divination and Gen Tsering Gyatso [Tib. ཚེ་རིང་རྒྱ་མཚོ] became my pecha gegen. Arab Rimpoche taught me first the Tibetan alphabet and after that, he taught me how to read. After that, I learned by heart the prayers of the protective deities and the scriptures of Sangde Jigsum [Tib. གསང་བདེ་འཇིག་གསུམ]; Sangwa Düpa [Tib. གསང་བ་འདུས་པ], Dechog [Tib. བདེ་མཆོག] and <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. འཇིགས་བྱེད] The Yamantaka text.">Jigje</a> [Tib. འཇིགས་བྱེད] in my native homeland. When I was 15 years old, I came to the Drepung Monastery.   

**Q:**  You came to monastery when you were 15 years old?   

**A:**  Yes, at that time, the Chinese had already came to Lhasa, but they hadn't built the motorable road yet [so it was between 1951-1954]. So we had to travel riding horses and mules. It took one month to reach Lhasa.   

**Q:**  At that time, how many horses did you have?   

**A:**  We had 6 muleteers and my <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཕྱག་མཛོད] A senior manager/treasurer of an aristocratic or monastic estate, or the senior manager/treasurer of an aristocratic family or a monastic unit. Generally chandzö handled both internal and external issues and were considered higher in power and status than nyerpa (stewards), who typically only handled the storerooms.">chandzö</a> (manager) Loten [Tib. བློ་བསྟན]   

**Q:**  What is the name of Loten's relative?   

**A:**  His name is Champa [Tib. བྱམས་པ]. He went to Lhasa ahead of us. He died 4 years ago. There were 6 muleteers and Gen Loten going with me.   

**Q:**  You had your servant (söpön [Tib. གསོལ་དཔོན]) with you, right?   

**A:**  There was no special <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. གསོལ་དཔོན] A lama or abbot&#x27;s servant.">söpön</a> for me. Gen Loten was the söpön and also the chandzö.   

**Q:**  When you came to Lhasa, did you come with only your own people or were there many people together in a group?   

**A:**  I came only with the people of the labrang. When we left for Lhasa, my parents and many other people came to see us off.   

**Q:**  How many days did they stay when they came to see you off?   

**A:**  My family members and my <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. གསོལ་དཔོན] A lama or abbot&#x27;s servant.">söpön</a> in the Labrang came to see us off to a distance of two days and two nights. Other people came to see us off to one days distance. We had to pitch tents at night. Then we came to the monastery. At first, we stayed in the small house in Senge Shar [Tib. སིང་གེ་ཤར] which is located in Lubug [Tib. ཀླུ་སྦུག] in Lhasa.   

**Q:**  Where did you stay in Senge Shar?   

**A:**  You were staying on this side and I was on the other side. We stayed there for three days. I think they were looking for an auspicious special day for (us to)give the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. བཏོང་སྒོ] An obligation to carry out a rite or prayer session in a monastery. For example, providing food and tea for all the monks in one&#x27;s monastic college at a prayer assembly. Or it could be an obligation to give all the monks a set amount of grain or the donggo obligation that many monastery office holders had to do when they left office. Generally, donggos had associated endowments that monks used by turns to fund a donggo. The monk with the donggo obligation would lend out the capital of the endowment and pay for the event from the interest he collected. This was also used for ritual obligations of government offices like the Tseja Office.">donggo</a> ceremony. In Drepung, the former Chödrak Lama had staying in Khangsar [Tib. ཁང་གསར] where the late Lochöde [Tib. བློ་ཆོས་སྡེ] stayed. There was a very good lama who was from our homeland in Bompora [Tib. སྤོམ་པོ་ར] Khamtse. He was called Gen Jamyang Chöndze [Tib. རྒན་འཇམ་དབྱངས་ཆོས་མཛད]. He said, "If you stay in Khangsar, it would be too far away from the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཆོས་ར] The special grove (&quot;dharma grove&quot;) in monasteries where monks formally met to practice debating.">chöra</a> (the debating grove) and you will waste your time." So he told the main <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཁང་ཚན] A monastic residential unit in which monks from specific geographic areas lived. These were corporate entities with property and internal officials. Some large khamtsen had smaller subordinate units called mi tshan. Khamtsen were part of tratsang (colleges). For example, Hamdong Khamtsen was part of Gomang College in Drepung Monastery.">khamtsen</a> that we need a <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. 1. ཤག, 2. ཞག] 1. The apartment/room of a monk. 2. The butter fat that coagulates on the top of butter-tea when the tea is left to sit for some time. If the tea had been made with a lot of butter, this layer could be thick enough to scoop off and save to later sell or eat separately. The senior monks are usually served tea with a lot of shag.">shag</a> (apartment). When Gen Loten tried to get a shag from the main khamtsen, on the top of the khamtsen there was a shag that belonged to Traya Kyamgön Rimpoche [Tib. བྲག་གྱབ་སྐྱབ་མགོན་རིན་པོ་ཆེ]. Under that, the shag belonged to Chungtsang [Tib. ཆུང་ཚང] Rimpoche. So there was no other shag.   

**Q:**  So you stayed on the second floor on top of the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཁང་ཚན་དགེ་རྒན] The head official of a khamtsen.">khamtsen gegen</a>'s <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. 1. ཤག, 2. ཞག] 1. The apartment/room of a monk. 2. The butter fat that coagulates on the top of butter-tea when the tea is left to sit for some time. If the tea had been made with a lot of butter, this layer could be thick enough to scoop off and save to later sell or eat separately. The senior monks are usually served tea with a lot of shag.">shag</a>, right?   

**A:**  Yes, this <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. 1. ཤག, 2. ཞག] 1. The apartment/room of a monk. 2. The butter fat that coagulates on the top of butter-tea when the tea is left to sit for some time. If the tea had been made with a lot of butter, this layer could be thick enough to scoop off and save to later sell or eat separately. The senior monks are usually served tea with a lot of shag.">shag</a> was for the senior monks. So the senior monks were saying that they don't want to give the shag to us. Later, we told the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཚོགས་འདུ] 1. The general name for the various types of Tibetan government assemblies. 2. Any assembly, e.g., the assembly (meeting) of monks in a college.">tsondu</a> and the tsondu gave us two shag and they destroyed the walls in between and made it into one (larger) shag.   

**Q:**  Then what did you do?   

**A:**  At that time, in the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཁང་ཚན] A monastic residential unit in which monks from specific geographic areas lived. These were corporate entities with property and internal officials. Some large khamtsen had smaller subordinate units called mi tshan. Khamtsen were part of tratsang (colleges). For example, Hamdong Khamtsen was part of Gomang College in Drepung Monastery.">khamtsen</a>, Tashi Tsering [Tib. བཀྲ་ཤིས་ཚེ་རིང] and Ngawang Phüntso [Tib. ངག་དབང་འཕུན་ཚོགས] were the better ones on pecha. So we asked for divination to Chungtsang Rimpoche and he said that Gen Tashi Tsering would be better. So my <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. དཔེ་ཆའི་དགེ་རྒན] A monk who teaches reading religious texts.">pecha gegen</a> was Tashi Tsering.   

**Q:**  Do you remember when you came to monastery?   

**A:**  Yes, I do.   

**Q:**  How did you come to the monastery?   

**A:**  I came to the monastery in a simple manner. I rode a horse and Gen Loten also rode a horse and the other servants came by walking.   

**Q:**  Was there any reception for you?   

**A:**  The main reception was held in Lhasa. The <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཁང་ཚན] A monastic residential unit in which monks from specific geographic areas lived. These were corporate entities with property and internal officials. Some large khamtsen had smaller subordinate units called mi tshan. Khamtsen were part of tratsang (colleges). For example, Hamdong Khamtsen was part of Gomang College in Drepung Monastery.">khamtsen</a> received us at the stone floor and the khamtsen gegen came to see me with few monks.   

**Q:**  Did they pitch a tent when they received you?   

**A:**  No, the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཁང་ཚན་དགེ་རྒན] The head official of a khamtsen.">khamtsen gegen</a> led me holding an incense holder (pöna [Tib. སྤོས་སྣ]) in his hand and first we had to go to the shag. The <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཁང་ཚན] A monastic residential unit in which monks from specific geographic areas lived. These were corporate entities with property and internal officials. Some large khamtsen had smaller subordinate units called mi tshan. Khamtsen were part of tratsang (colleges). For example, Hamdong Khamtsen was part of Gomang College in Drepung Monastery.">khamtsen</a> offered tea and <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. གྲོ་མ་འབྲས་སིལ] A special dish consisting of sweetened rice, melted butter and wild sweet potatoes (gro ma).">droma dresi</a> [Tib. གསོལ་ཇ་བཞེས་འབྲས]. Then I had to go to have the "new one's audience" [Tib. གསར་མཇལ] to the abbot (khembo).   

**Q:**  You mean on that same day?   

**A:**  Yes, we came early in the morning.   

**Q:**  When you were there, the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. མཁན་པོ] Abbot of a monastery or monastic college.">khembo</a> was Pema Rigdzin [Tib. པད་མ་རིག་འཛིན], right?   

**A:**  Yes.   

**Q:**  What did the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. མཁན་པོ] Abbot of a monastery or monastic college.">khembo</a> say?   

**A:**  I don't remember what he said. Then we offered the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. གྲྭ་ཇ] The prayer session sponsored by the tratsang (college) at which tea was served to its monks who attended.">traja</a> (college prayer assembly) in the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. གྲྭ་ཚང] A &quot;college&quot; within a monastery, for example, in Drepung Monastery there were four main tratsang: Gomang, Loseling, Deyang and Ngagpa. These tratsang were property owning corporate entities and included monks who were organized into residential dormitories called Khamtsen.">tratsang</a> and I had to go to <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཚོགས] 1. A prayer assembly meeting in monasteries when all the monks come to an assembly hall and chant prayers together. 2. An offering made of tsamba, butter and dry cheese in the shape of a cone.">tsog</a> (the prayer assembly)with one söpön.   

**Q:**  Was that the next day?   

**A:**  Yes, it was on the next day when I got admitted in the monastery (chöshug [Tib. ཆོས་ཞུགས]). At that time, Gen Loten asked me, "How much <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. འགྱེ] Alms given to monks.">gye</a> (alms) are you going to offer?" I said I will offer 10 sang. So he agreed to that. Gen Loten might have been thinking that I might say that I wanted the rank of a <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཚོགས་ཆེན] The main assembly hall of a monastery. The assembly hall for the monastery as a whole.">tsogchen</a> trüku (the highest level of incarnation). I didn't say that I wanted the rank of tsogchen trüku. After that, I joined the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཚོགས] 1. A prayer assembly meeting in monasteries when all the monks come to an assembly hall and chant prayers together. 2. An offering made of tsamba, butter and dry cheese in the shape of a cone.">tsog</a> and I sat on the front-most part of the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. གྲྭ་ཚང] A &quot;college&quot; within a monastery, for example, in Drepung Monastery there were four main tratsang: Gomang, Loseling, Deyang and Ngagpa. These tratsang were property owning corporate entities and included monks who were organized into residential dormitories called Khamtsen.">tratsang</a> because I offered the highest gye.   

**Q:**  What about Samdong [Tib. ཟམ་གདོང]?   

**A:**  Samdong was sitting below me. Just before the war began, the fat lama from Lhopa Khamtsen with a moustache offered more <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. འགྱེ] Alms given to monks.">gye</a> than I did. Probably, he offered 15 sang. So then he sat before me. He just stayed for one or two months and then went back to his homeland. During the Mönlam, it was very bad because the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཚོགས་ཆེན] The main assembly hall of a monastery. The assembly hall for the monastery as a whole.">tsogchen</a> trüku would come later.   

**Q:**  They would push, right?   

**A:**  Yes, and this was the place where we fight. It was very hard then.   

**A:**  Then what did you do?   

**A:**  After we supplied the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. གྲྭ་ཇ] The prayer session sponsored by the tratsang (college) at which tea was served to its monks who attended.">traja</a> and gave the feast to the uchö of the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. གྲྭ་ཚང] A &quot;college&quot; within a monastery, for example, in Drepung Monastery there were four main tratsang: Gomang, Loseling, Deyang and Ngagpa. These tratsang were property owning corporate entities and included monks who were organized into residential dormitories called Khamtsen.">tratsang</a> [The Umdze (chant/prayer leader) and the Gegö (disciplinary head of a tratsang)], the representatives of the government who was a <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. རྩེ་དྲུང] A monk official in the Tibetan government.">tsidrung</a> came over. I remember that I had to stand on the throne and he gave me the blessing ribbon [Tib. སྲུང་མདུད] and a <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཁ་བཏགས] A Tibetan ceremonial scarf given to lamas, visitors, etc.">khata</a> from the Dalai Lama. They did this even though I was not a <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཚོགས་ཆེན] The main assembly hall of a monastery. The assembly hall for the monastery as a whole.">tsogchen</a> trüku. I don't know the reason. And then the umdze and the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. དགེ་སྐོས] The main disciplinary official in a monastic college (tratsang).">gegö</a> came to seek blessings from me and they offered me khata scarves.   

**Q:**  Did the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. མཁན་པོ] Abbot of a monastery or monastic college.">khembo</a> come to offer you a <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཁ་བཏགས] A Tibetan ceremonial scarf given to lamas, visitors, etc.">khata</a>?   

**A:**  No, the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. མཁན་པོ] Abbot of a monastery or monastic college.">khembo</a> didn't come. After that, in order to bring good luck, the khembo taught me a little Düdra. On that day, I had to join the chöra(debate grove) and recite what I learnt on that day. I had to debate for the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. དམ་བཅའ] 1. An oath, promise. 2. A type of monastic debate where two or three monks sit while others stand and ask them questions.">thamja</a> [Tib. དམ་བཅའ] where I answered the questions. At that time, I had to take a <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. གསོལ་དཔོན] A lama or abbot&#x27;s servant.">söpön</a> with me. After a few days, I had to serve tea in the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཁང་ཚན] A monastic residential unit in which monks from specific geographic areas lived. These were corporate entities with property and internal officials. Some large khamtsen had smaller subordinate units called mi tshan. Khamtsen were part of tratsang (colleges). For example, Hamdong Khamtsen was part of Gomang College in Drepung Monastery.">khamtsen</a>, the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཚོམ་ཇ] The name of the khamtsen&#x27;s prayer assembly meetings at which tea was served.">tsomja</a>, together with a rice gruel <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཐུག་པ] 1. A porridge or gruel-like soup typically made with tsamba, and if available, meat and cheese. 2. Noodle dishes in broth.">thukpa</a> [Tib. མིང་བཏགས]. That's how I got admitted into the monastery.   

**Q:**  Do you remember how many monks there were in Nyare Khamtsen?   

**A:**  I think there were more than 500 monks.   

**Q:**  Do you remember how much <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. འགྱེ] Alms given to monks.">gye</a> you offered?   

**A:**  I don't remember how much <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. འགྱེ] Alms given to monks.">gye</a> I offered. I just remember that we offered one <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཁ་བཏགས] A Tibetan ceremonial scarf given to lamas, visitors, etc.">khata</a> for each monk.   

**Q:**  From this point, we two have the same story, right?   

**A:**  Yes, there was nothing new, but when we were in the monastery, it was the time when it was a little hard.   

**Q:**  How hard was that when you were new in the monastery?   

**A:**  When I first came to the monastery, I felt it was quite hard because everything was new for me and I didn't know any one in the monastery and I didn't have anybody to talk to.   

**Q:**  When you came to the monastery, Traya Rimpoche was already there, right?   

**A:**  Rimpoche had come one year before.   

**Q:**  Then what happened?   

**A:**  At that time, Traya Rimpoche and Tongden Rimpoche [Tib. རྟོག་ལྡན་རིན་པོ་ཆེ] were there.   

**Q:**  Tongden Rimpoche came to the monastery before you?   

**A:**  Yes.   

**Q:**  I think Tongden was also staying in the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཁང་ཚན] A monastic residential unit in which monks from specific geographic areas lived. These were corporate entities with property and internal officials. Some large khamtsen had smaller subordinate units called mi tshan. Khamtsen were part of tratsang (colleges). For example, Hamdong Khamtsen was part of Gomang College in Drepung Monastery.">khamtsen</a>, right?   

**A:**  Yes, he was my neighbor.   

**Q:**  So the second floor belonged to the two of you, right?   

**A:**  On the other side where the Shri Devi's chamber [Tib. ལྷ་མོའི་རྟེན་མཁར]] was located, there were two <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. 1. ཤག, 2. ཞག] 1. The apartment/room of a monk. 2. The butter fat that coagulates on the top of butter-tea when the tea is left to sit for some time. If the tea had been made with a lot of butter, this layer could be thick enough to scoop off and save to later sell or eat separately. The senior monks are usually served tea with a lot of shag.">shag</a> and one belonged to Lobsang Wangdra [Tib. བློ་བཟང་དབང་གྲགས] and the other shag belonged to Gen Changchup [Tib. rgan byang 'chup].   

**Q:**  Gen Changchup is related to Gen Gyurmey [Tib. འགྱུར་མེད], right?   

**A:**  Yes.   

**Q:**  Then what happened?   

**A:**  Gen Loten stayed with me for awhile and then he went to India to do trade. When he came back, the Chinese vehicle had already arrived in Tibet. So he sold his mules in Lhasa.   

**Q:**  How many mules did he have?   

**A:**  I think he had three <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ལག] A traditional Tibetan unit comprising of ten transport animals. This term was normally used for mules and donkeys.">lag</a> [Tib. ལག] [1 lag   10 mules]. Gen Loten sold his three lag of mules to Atrug lama [Tib. ཨ་ཕྲུག་བླ་མ].   

**Q:**  Atrug Lama, the one who was a Military Officer [Tib. དམག་དཔོན] in the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཆུ་བཞི་སྒང་དྲུག] The anti-Chinese Khamba insurgency force in Tibet that began in 1957 in Lhasa and launched an uprising against the Chinese the following year. The name means, &quot;four rivers and six mountain ranges,&quot; and refers to Eastern Tibet.">Chushigandru</a>?   

**A:**  He became a Military Officer later. Gen Loten used the money he got from selling the mules and bought goods from India. He took some goods to his native land using Chinese vehicles.   

**Q:**  So he didn't come back?   

**A:**  No, he didn't. He tried to come back again before the war (1959). If he came in winter, I think he could have come to Lhasa before the Mönlam Festival began. He said that he doesn't want to come in vehicles and he want to come after the mules in summer. He was planning to give the Geshe <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. བཏོང་སྒོ] An obligation to carry out a rite or prayer session in a monastery. For example, providing food and tea for all the monks in one&#x27;s monastic college at a prayer assembly. Or it could be an obligation to give all the monks a set amount of grain or the donggo obligation that many monastery office holders had to do when they left office. Generally, donggos had associated endowments that monks used by turns to fund a donggo. The monk with the donggo obligation would lend out the capital of the endowment and pay for the event from the interest he collected. This was also used for ritual obligations of government offices like the Tseja Office.">donggo</a> and he had already packed his things. But after Mönlam, the fighting began. The Chinese made Gen Loten suffer very severely and he died from starvation.
