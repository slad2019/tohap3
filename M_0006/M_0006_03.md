**A:**  We get a good income from selling cow dung in Lhasa which was used for operating expenses of the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. གཞིས་ཀ] A manorial estate.">shiga</a>. We have two big cow dung store rooms with the size of two pillars where we store the dung we collected from the upper part of the valley. The shiga would not use cow dung for the fuel.   

**Q:**  What do you use for fuel in the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. གཞིས་ཀ] A manorial estate.">shiga</a>?   

**A:**  We use kind of fuel called nyabshag [Tib. ?] and horse dung. We get 1,000 <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. རྡོ་ཚད] A currency unit in traditional Tibet that was equal to 50 ngüsang.">dotse</a> from selling cow dung and we didn't need to pay tax for that. We get no money for operating expenses from the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. གཉེར་ཚང] 1. Storehouse. 2. Steward, person in charge of a storehouse. 3. A monastic official in charge of storerooms.">nyertsang</a>, this cow dung is what we use. The nyertsang also needs fuel and we also send cow dung to the nyertsang.   

**Q:**  Do you send firewood or cow dung?   

**A:**  We send the woods like alpine willow tree [Tib. གླང་མ] and the tree from which lacquer is produced [Tib. བསེ་བ] for frying cookies, khabse [Tib. ཁ་ཟས] for the New Year, Lösar [Tib. ལོ་གསར]. Each monk gets 13 khabse about the size of 3 feet long. The wood is for frying the khabse. For these khabse we use 333-334 <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཁལ] A traditional volume measurement used for measuring grain in traditional Tibetan society. Sizes of this unit varied somewhat, but the official government khe (called mkhar ru or bstan dzin mkha ru) weighed about 28-31 pounds for barley. It was used to convey the size of fields. For example, a field said to be 10 khe in size meant that 10 khe of seed could be sown on that field.">khe</a> of wheat flour. The <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. མི་སེར] A term that can mean serf/bound subject as well as citizen, depending on context. For example, the miser of a lord would connote the bound subjects of that lord, whereas the miser of Tibet would connote citizens of Tibet.">miser</a> eat a leisurely meal after dark, and then set out in dark to transport the wood (on donkeys) to the monastery. They go to a place on the bank of the river near <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. རམ་མ་སྒང] A ferry site on the Lhasa River south of Lhasa City.">Ramagang</a> [Tib. ར་མ་སྒང] where there is a ferry with a carved horse head in the front. We load the wood along with the donkeys into the ferry and cross the river near Norbulinga. From there we transport the wood on donkeys and arrive in Drepung at about dawn. The <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. གཉེར་ཚང] 1. Storehouse. 2. Steward, person in charge of a storehouse. 3. A monastic official in charge of storerooms.">nyertsang</a> would then give us food and tea and they would fry the khabse.   

**Q:**  Was there a book with the names of each <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཁྲལ་པ] The class of bound peasant/miser/serf households who held farmland and had to fulfill large corvée tax obligations to their manorial estates/lords. They are often called taxpayer households in English. While some of these were well off by local standards, many were poor due to a variety of factors such as heavy debts and a dearth of able-bodied workers in their households.">treba</a> and how much land they have?   

**A:**  Yes we had.   

**Q:**  What was the name of the book?   

**A:**  It was called "the work book of the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. གྲྭ་ཚང] A &quot;college&quot; within a monastery, for example, in Drepung Monastery there were four main tratsang: Gomang, Loseling, Deyang and Ngagpa. These tratsang were property owning corporate entities and included monks who were organized into residential dormitories called Khamtsen.">tratsang</a>" [Tib. གྲྭ་ཚང་གི་ལས་དེབ]. The old shidü gives it to the new one when they change. No one actually reads this book and no one could take it away. <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. སྡེ་ཡངས] One of the colleges in Drepung Monastery.">Deyang</a> Shiga was the most complicated one among the Deyang's shiga. There were 7 water mills in that area of the shiga. When we have to mill the wheat into flour for the khabse, we divide the wheat between the 7 water mills. We weigh it out when we give it to each of them and weigh it when we get back the flour. And there was no way of doing things carelessly [Tib. བ་རེ་བོ་རེ].   

**Q:**  You also mill barley into <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. རྩམ་པ] The traditional Tibetan staple food that consists of grain that is roasted (popped), usually in sand, and then ground into a flour.">tsampa</a> in those mills, right?   

**A:**  Yes.   

**Q:**  What do you plant mostly on the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. གཞིས་ཀ] A manorial estate.">shiga</a>'s fields?   

**A:**  Mostly barley and also wheat and peas.   

**Q:**  Among the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. མི་སེར] A term that can mean serf/bound subject as well as citizen, depending on context. For example, the miser of a lord would connote the bound subjects of that lord, whereas the miser of Tibet would connote citizens of Tibet.">miser</a> household, what was the largest amount of <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཁལ] A traditional volume measurement used for measuring grain in traditional Tibetan society. Sizes of this unit varied somewhat, but the official government khe (called mkhar ru or bstan dzin mkha ru) weighed about 28-31 pounds for barley. It was used to convey the size of fields. For example, a field said to be 10 khe in size meant that 10 khe of seed could be sown on that field.">khe</a> of land do they hold? And what was the smallest amount of khe of land?   

**A:**  One <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཁྲལ་རྐང] The name of the basic tax unit for arable land in traditional Tibetan society. Families with farm land would have one or more fields of different sizes, e.g., 1 tregang or 1/2 of a tregang. This was defined by a fixed number of khe of seed (tib. sönkhe) that would be sown on that field. For example, one tregang in some areas would consist of 10 sönkhe. There was substantial variation between and within regions and types of estates.">tregang</a> had 50 <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཁལ] A traditional volume measurement used for measuring grain in traditional Tibetan society.

For example, a field said to be 10 khe in size meant that 10 khe of seed could be sown on that field.">khe</a> of land which is the largest amount and they have to send one <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. འུལ་ལག] A generic term for corvée labor that had to be performed for one&#x27;s manorial estate/lord without pay. One kind of ula required people to go and work and another kind required the provision of transportation animals.">ula</a> everyday. The households who send ula on every other days [Tib. གནངས་ཆག] have 25 khe of land.   

**Q:**  There was no household who had two <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཁྲལ་རྐང] The name of the basic tax unit for arable land in traditional Tibetan society. Families with farm land would have one or more fields of different sizes, e.g., 1 tregang or 1/2 of a tregang. This was defined by a fixed number of khe of seed (tib. sönkhe) that would be sown on that field. For example, one tregang in some areas would consist of 10 sönkhe. There was substantial variation between and within regions and types of estates.">tregang</a>, right?   

**A:**  Yes. If they need more fields, they would expand a little by opening new fields or trying to plant some more fields that belonged to other households.   

**Q:**  What happens if a household gets exhausted [Tib. སྟོངས]? Do you divide the land among the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. མི་སེར] A term that can mean serf/bound subject as well as citizen, depending on context. For example, the miser of a lord would connote the bound subjects of that lord, whereas the miser of Tibet would connote citizens of Tibet.">miser</a>?   

**A:**  No, we would tell another household from among the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. གྲྭ་ཚང] A &quot;college&quot; within a monastery, for example, in Drepung Monastery there were four main tratsang: Gomang, Loseling, Deyang and Ngagpa. These tratsang were property owning corporate entities and included monks who were organized into residential dormitories called Khamtsen.">tratsang</a> miser to take over the tregang.   

**Q:**  Where does such person come from?   

**A:**  If we get people from local area, we call them. If not, we summon one of our <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. མི་སེར] A term that can mean serf/bound subject as well as citizen, depending on context. For example, the miser of a lord would connote the bound subjects of that lord, whereas the miser of Tibet would connote citizens of Tibet.">miser</a> from wherever like Lungshö [Tib. ཀླུང་ཤོད] and put him there.   

**Q:**  Do you call somebody from among the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. མི་བོགས] A status wherein a peasant &quot;leased&quot; his/her &quot;freedom&quot; from his/her lord to live and work where he/she wanted. The peasants with human lease status still belonged to their lord and were required to pay an annual fee (&quot;human lease fee&quot;) to their lord. The children of human lease peasants inherited this status from parents of the same sex (i.e. sons of a male belonged to their father&#x27;s lord).">mibo</a> payers?   

**A:**  If there is one capable of doing the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཁྲལ་རྐང] The name of the basic tax unit for arable land in traditional Tibetan society. Families with farm land would have one or more fields of different sizes, e.g., 1 tregang or 1/2 of a tregang.

The children of human lease peasants inherited this status from parents of the same sex (i.e. sons of a male belonged to their father&#x27;s lord).">mibo</a> payers, then we would call them. If not, we wouldn't and would summon from one of our shiga.   

**Q:**  What about sending a person as an additional to work for the tax, <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཁྲལ་སྣོན] The sending by a lord of one of his serfs/servants to another of his subject families as a servant.">trenön</a> [Tib. ཁྲལ་སྣོན] to the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཁྲལ་པ] The class of bound peasant/miser/serf households who held farmland and had to fulfill large corvée tax obligations to their manorial estates/lords. They are often called taxpayer households in English. While some of these were well off by local standards, many were poor due to a variety of factors such as heavy debts and a dearth of able-bodied workers in their households.">treba</a> who is shortage of work hand?   

**A:**  Yes, if a household needs a <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཁྲལ་སྣོན] The sending by a lord of one of his serfs/servants to another of his subject families as a servant.">trenön</a>, the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. གྲྭ་ཚང] A &quot;college&quot; within a monastery, for example, in Drepung Monastery there were four main tratsang: Gomang, Loseling, Deyang and Ngagpa. These tratsang were property owning corporate entities and included monks who were organized into residential dormitories called Khamtsen.">tratsang</a> would tell the person to go there. We, shidü was not allowed to say that.   

**Q:**  Who has the power to do that?   

**A:**  The <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཕྱག་སྦུག] A manager (of estates and endowments) of a monastic college or monastic khamtsen.">chabu</a> has the power. A <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཁྲལ་པ] The class of bound peasant/miser/serf households who held farmland and had to fulfill large corvée tax obligations to their manorial estates/lords. They are often called taxpayer households in English. While some of these were well off by local standards, many were poor due to a variety of factors such as heavy debts and a dearth of able-bodied workers in their households.">treba</a> has to explain the shidü why he needs a <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཁྲལ་སྣོན] The sending by a lord of one of his serfs/servants to another of his subject families as a servant.">trenön</a> and then the shidü would have to report the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. གྲྭ་ཚང] A &quot;college&quot; within a monastery, for example, in Drepung Monastery there were four main tratsang: Gomang, Loseling, Deyang and Ngagpa. These tratsang were property owning corporate entities and included monks who were organized into residential dormitories called Khamtsen.">tratsang</a> and the tratsang would say,"we will give him a trenön".   

**Q:**  Was the person who was sent as <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཁྲལ་སྣོན] The sending by a lord of one of his serfs/servants to another of his subject families as a servant.">trenön</a> allowed to say no?   

**A:**  He is not allowed to say no.   

**Q:**  Were they allowed to call the person for <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཁྲལ་སྣོན] The sending by a lord of one of his serfs/servants to another of his subject families as a servant.">trenön</a> from a <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཁྲལ་རྐང] The name of the basic tax unit for arable land in traditional Tibetan society. Families with farm land would have one or more fields of different sizes, e.g., 1 tregang or 1/2 of a tregang. This was defined by a fixed number of khe of seed (tib. sönkhe) that would be sown on that field. For example, one tregang in some areas would consist of 10 sönkhe. There was substantial variation between and within regions and types of estates.">tregang</a> house hold who have extra people?   

**A:**  No. They call the people who were wandering around for the trenön.   

**Q:**  When a person was sent as <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཁྲལ་སྣོན] The sending by a lord of one of his serfs/servants to another of his subject families as a servant.">trenön</a>, he or she would be like a servant of that household, right?   

**A:**  Temporarily, would be a servant. But if he or she was capable and did well, they wouldn't call servant and they even would become the master of the household and would be called master [Tib. བདག་པོ].   

**Q:**  Tell us about the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. དགེ་གཡོག] Monk assistant to the disciplinary official (gegö) in monasteries.">geyog</a>. How long would it take from the time when you first become geyog until you become the senior geyog, drepa [Tib. བགྲེས་པ] ?   

**A:**  I can't tell the time. I did the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. དགེ་གཡོག] Monk assistant to the disciplinary official (gegö) in monasteries.">geyog</a> for 8 years and I became geyog dreba for 2 years.   

**Q:**  The drepa was the one who carry a thin long pole, right?   

**A:**  Yes.   

**Q:**  Who cut the pole for you? Do the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ལྟོ་ཚང] 1. The club of the Dobdos. 2. A group of people eating together.">tobtsang</a> dobdo cut it for you?   

**A:**  One's <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. དགེ་ཕྲུག] 1. Student. 2. Disciple. 3. Commonly the name for monks living with a gegen or teacher. These are more like wards than real disciples.">gidru</a> would cut it which is to steal from the parks that belonged to the government.   

**Q:**  Where did you stay as <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. དགེ་གཡོག] Monk assistant to the disciplinary official (gegö) in monasteries.">geyog</a> at first in the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཇོ་ཁང] A most famous temple in Lhasa that houses a holy statue of the Buddha. It is often used to mean the Tsuglagang Temple of which it is a part.">Jokhang</a>?   

**A:**  I stayed in the west courtyard, Khamranub [Tib. འཁྱམས་ར་ནུབ] and I was called Bugtsang [Tib. སྦུག་ཚང] geyog.   

**Q:**  Where would you stay when you become dreba?   

**A:**  There is no set place for the dreba. As we get older we have to go through the back door relation and ask the shengo for the area from where I can get the income.   

**Q:**  The <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. དགེ་གཡོག] Monk assistant to the disciplinary official (gegö) in monasteries.">geyog</a> gets 14 alms shares, right? How many times would you stretch your hands for asking extra alms in the time between?   

**A:**  There wasn't any fixed limit. If the alms giver [Tib. འགྱེད་གཏོང་བ] is good, we get quite a good amoumt, but if the alms giver is not so good, we wouldn't get much.   

**Q:**  If the alms giver is good, would he count the money and give you or would he just give you without counting?   

**A:**  If the alms giver is good, they don't even count and give alot like this much dayang.   

**Q:**  But you have to give alot to the shengo, right?   

**A:**  Yes, I swear by the Buddha statue in the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཇོ་ཁང] A most famous temple in Lhasa that houses a holy statue of the Buddha. It is often used to mean the Tsuglagang Temple of which it is a part.">Jokhang</a> [Tib. ཇོ་བོ་རིན་པོ] that I just had to give up being <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. དགེ་གཡོག] Monk assistant to the disciplinary official (gegö) in monasteries.">geyog</a> because the burden was too heavy which made the income and the expenditure become unbalanced. [laughter] But I don't blame the shengo. <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. བློ་གསལ་གླིང] One of the main colleges in Drepung Monastery.">Loseling</a> and <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. སྒོ་མང] One of the large colleges in Drepung Monastery.">Gomang</a> shengo have big responsibility for the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. གཏོང་སྒོ] A monastic obligation to provide the food and other necessary items served at a monastic prayer assembly meeting or some other rite; this was often a required obligation for monastic officials at the end of their term of office.">tonggo</a>. Loseling had 7,700 monks and one of the main sources of the tonggo expenses was the donation collected from the geyog. Then he also gets some when they fine the robbers and thieves. So the 2 shengo say " we collect the income and give the tonggo" [Tib. ཡོང་སྒོ་བསྡུས་ནས་གཏོང་སྒོ]. So we can't say that the shengo is taking bribes because we had insisted and asked him for the position, so he couldn't refuse it when some of his friends requested him.   

**Q:**  What were the shengo's <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. གཏོང་སྒོ] A monastic obligation to provide the food and other necessary items served at a monastic prayer assembly meeting or some other rite; this was often a required obligation for monastic officials at the end of their term of office.">tonggo</a>?   

**A:**  In <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. བློ་གསལ་གླིང] One of the main colleges in Drepung Monastery.">Loseling</a>, they had to use 53 skin bag/loads of rice [maybe 80-90 gyama in wieght] for the rice gruel <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཐུག་པ] 1. A porridge or gruel-like soup typically made with tsamba, and if available, meat and cheese. 2. Noodle dishes in broth.">thukpa</a> [Tib. ཐུག་པ་མིང་བཏགས]. The meat was imposed on the Thambag [Tib. དན་འབག] butchers as a tax where they pay just a token of the price. For the two bigger <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. གྲྭ་ཚང] A &quot;college&quot; within a monastery, for example, in Drepung Monastery there were four main tratsang: Gomang, Loseling, Deyang and Ngagpa. These tratsang were property owning corporate entities and included monks who were organized into residential dormitories called Khamtsen.">tratsang</a>, they use 35 quarters of a carcass [Tib. བཞི་གླིང] of beef for one rice gruel for each tratsang. It is the meat of 8 yaks. For the 2 smaller tratsang, they use about 25 quarters.   

**Q:**  Would they give the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. གཏོང་སྒོ] A monastic obligation to provide the food and other necessary items served at a monastic prayer assembly meeting or some other rite; this was often a required obligation for monastic officials at the end of their term of office.">tonggo</a> for each <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. གྲྭ་ཚང] A &quot;college&quot; within a monastery, for example, in Drepung Monastery there were four main tratsang: Gomang, Loseling, Deyang and Ngagpa. These tratsang were property owning corporate entities and included monks who were organized into residential dormitories called Khamtsen.">tratsang</a>?   

**A:**  Yes. There were two shengo where sometimes, <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. བློ་གསལ་གླིང] One of the main colleges in Drepung Monastery.">Loseling</a> and <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. སྒོ་མང] One of the large colleges in Drepung Monastery.">Gomang</a> comes to get together and sometimes Loseling and <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. སྡེ་ཡངས] One of the colleges in Drepung Monastery.">Deyang</a> comes together. And sometimes, Ngagpa and Gomang comes together. The Gomang shengo gives the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. གཏོང་སྒོ] A monastic obligation to provide the food and other necessary items served at a monastic prayer assembly meeting or some other rite; this was often a required obligation for monastic officials at the end of their term of office.">tonggo</a> for Gomang, the Deyang shengo gives the tonggo for Deyang etc. They give the tonggo only for their own tratsang.   

**Q:**  If so, the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. སྡེ་ཡངས] One of the colleges in Drepung Monastery.">Deyang</a> shengo would get a good profit because Deyang have a small amount of monks, right?   

**A:**  The number of monks is small, but they couldn't do the shengo every year. For the 2 small <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. གྲྭ་ཚང] A &quot;college&quot; within a monastery, for example, in Drepung Monastery there were four main tratsang: Gomang, Loseling, Deyang and Ngagpa. These tratsang were property owning corporate entities and included monks who were organized into residential dormitories called Khamtsen.">tratsang</a>, they become shengo only once every 3-4 years.   

**Q:**  But the individual shengo gets the profit, right?   

**A:**  Yes.   

**Q:**  What else the shengo have to give other than the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཐུག་པ] 1. A porridge or gruel-like soup typically made with tsamba, and if available, meat and cheese. 2. Noodle dishes in broth.">thukpa</a>?   

**A:**  They had to give <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. གྲྭ་ཇ] The prayer session sponsored by the tratsang (college) at which tea was served to its monks who attended.">traja</a> and <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. འགྱེ] Alms given to monks.">gye</a> gye.   

**Q:**  Was there a fixed amount for the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. འགྱེ] Alms given to monks.">gye</a>?   

**A:**  There is no fixed amount for the gye.   

**Q:**  When you were the shidü, how much <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. འགྱེ] Alms given to monks.">gye</a> did the shengo give?   

**A:**  About 10 <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཏམ་ཀ] A unit in the traditional Tibetan currency system that was equal to 4 sang.">tranka</a> per monk. Not much.   

**Q:**  The main expense was for the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཐུག་པ] 1. A porridge or gruel-like soup typically made with tsamba, and if available, meat and cheese. 2. Noodle dishes in broth.">thukpa</a>, right?   

**A:**  Yes. For our <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. གྲྭ་ཚང] A &quot;college&quot; within a monastery, for example, in Drepung Monastery there were four main tratsang: Gomang, Loseling, Deyang and Ngagpa. These tratsang were property owning corporate entities and included monks who were organized into residential dormitories called Khamtsen.">tratsang</a>, they use about 20 skin bag/loads of rice for the thukpa. There were about 500 monks. In the bigger tratsang, they use about 50 skin bag/loads of rice.   

**Q:**  When you were <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. དགེ་གཡོག] Monk assistant to the disciplinary official (gegö) in monasteries.">geyog</a>, did you have any incidents with some callous people [Tib. རྫབ་ཅན] who didn't abide by the law?   

**A:**  No. After I ended, I heard that there were some bad people.   

**Q:**  I heard that when the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. དགེ་གཡོག] Monk assistant to the disciplinary official (gegö) in monasteries.">geyog</a> goes by the roads, they were allowed to punish people, was that right?   

**A:**  I heard that some did that when they provoked [Tib. བརྙས་བརྐོ] the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. དགེ་གཡོག] Monk assistant to the disciplinary official (gegö) in monasteries.">geyog</a>. When I was the geyog, there was no such things because it was early before the revolution. Later, I heard that when the revolution was about to rise, the situation probably became like disturbant [Tib. རོབ་ཆགས].   

**Q:**  Usually, would they put the braver <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. དགེ་གཡོག] Monk assistant to the disciplinary official (gegö) in monasteries.">geyog</a> at the place called Dayabwog [Tib. མདའ་ཡབ་འོག] in the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཇོ་ཁང] A most famous temple in Lhasa that houses a holy statue of the Buddha. It is often used to mean the Tsuglagang Temple of which it is a part.">Jokhang</a>?   

**A:**  No, they wouldn't. When I was the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. དགེ་གཡོག] Monk assistant to the disciplinary official (gegö) in monasteries.">geyog</a>, I stayed in the Khyamranub which was a poorer place where I can get little bit from the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. འགྱེ] Alms given to monks.">gye</a> givers. The best area was the second floor, Barkhang [Tib. བར་ཁང] which is locatd under the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. བླ་ཕྱག] 1. The abbreviation of bla brang phyag mdzod, a major treasury/supply office that was located on the second floor of the Tsuglagang Temple and collected taxes annually from various parts of Tibet. 2. A monastic official/manager who worked for the Labrang of the abbots or incarnate lamas. For example, in Loseling College in Drepung, the Laja worked for the abbot who appointed him.">Laja</a> Office. The geyog who gets this, is called Laja geyog. For this area, we have to bribe quite a lot and if you get the Laja geyog, you can earn about 600 <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. རྡོ་ཚད] A currency unit in traditional Tibet that was equal to 50 ngüsang.">dotse</a> for the 21 days of Mönlam. When I got this area, the shengo told me that he wants 70 dotse and I had to pay 70 dotse and I got back little over 600 dotse. When I became Laja geyog, at night I gave the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. 1. ཆང, 2. བྱང] 1. Tibetan locally brewed barley beer. 2.

Sizes of this unit varied somewhat, but the official government khe (called mkhar ru or bstan dzin mkha ru) weighed about 28-31 pounds for barley. It was used to convey the size of fields. For example, a field said to be 10 khe in size meant that 10 khe of seed could be sown on that field.">khe</a> of barley to the Laja sweepers as the bribe and on the next they stole butter when there is a big <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. བཏོང་སྒོ] An obligation to carry out a rite or prayer session in a monastery. For example, providing food and tea for all the monks in one&#x27;s monastic college at a prayer assembly. Or it could be an obligation to give all the monks a set amount of grain or the donggo obligation that many monastery office holders had to do when they left office. Generally, donggos had associated endowments that monks used by turns to fund a donggo. The monk with the donggo obligation would lend out the capital of the endowment and pay for the event from the interest he collected. This was also used for ritual obligations of government offices like the Tseja Office.">donggo</a> and gave it to me. This was the method we take. The Laja geyog can also ask the Laja Office for gifts of butter, dried fruit, rice and tea leaves. They serve meals [Tib. གསོལ་ཚིགས] in Laja Office and we could also eat the meals.   

**Q:**  You bribe the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. བླ་ཕྱག] 1. The abbreviation of bla brang phyag mdzod, a major treasury/supply office that was located on the second floor of the Tsuglagang Temple and collected taxes annually from various parts of Tibet. 2. A monastic official/manager who worked for the Labrang of the abbots or incarnate lamas. For example, in Loseling College in Drepung, the Laja worked for the abbot who appointed him.">Laja</a> sweepers because they tell the Laja Office to give you the stuffs, right?   

**A:**  No, they act smart by stealing and give the stuffs to us.   

**Q:**  You mean they steal and divide the stuffs with you?   

**A:**  Not really dividing, they give is the whole stuffs they stole like 5-6 <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཁལ] A traditional volume measurement used for measuring grain in traditional Tibetan society. Sizes of this unit varied somewhat, but the official government khe (called mkhar ru or bstan dzin mkha ru) weighed about 28-31 pounds for barley. It was used to convey the size of fields. For example, a field said to be 10 khe in size meant that 10 khe of seed could be sown on that field.">khe</a> of butter. That's how we accumulated the incomes. In addtion to 70 <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. རྡོ་ཚད] A currency unit in traditional Tibet that was equal to 50 ngüsang.">dotse</a>, I also had to give the shengo 8 dotse which was meant for asking for the area, büdö [Tib. འབུལ་དོད].   

**Q:**  This, you had to pay every year, right?   

**A:**  Yes. We also had to give the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. གཏོང་སྒོ] A monastic obligation to provide the food and other necessary items served at a monastic prayer assembly meeting or some other rite; this was often a required obligation for monastic officials at the end of their term of office.">tonggo</a> donation every year. The amount we had to give kept going up every year.   

**Q:**  I heard that in the Mönlam, the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ལྡབ་ལྡོབ] A mildly deviant type of fighting or &quot;punk&quot; monk who engaged in fighting and other unusual behaviors for monks in traditional Tibet&#x27;s large monasteries.">dobdo</a> would make a noise like jeering [Tib. འ་ཆ་རྒྱག]. What is the point of jeering?   

**A:**  It's for being sarcastic [Tib. མ་མཛེས་མཛེས] to the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. དགེ་གཡོག] Monk assistant to the disciplinary official (gegö) in monasteries.">geyog</a>. They were implying that the geyog is not doing the right thing on over seeing the discipline.   

**Q:**  If these <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ལྡབ་ལྡོབ] A mildly deviant type of fighting or &quot;punk&quot; monk who engaged in fighting and other unusual behaviors for monks in traditional Tibet&#x27;s large monasteries.">dobdo</a> do this what do you do?   

**A:**  If I know who did that I would beat them alot.   

**Q:**  Have you ever beat them?   

**A:**  Yes.   

**Q:**  Did you beat them on their backs?   

**A:**  Yes, a little bit. I beat them with my stick on their backs while they are seated. Right there I do it, and then it is finished.   

**Q:**  There is a <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ལྡབ་ལྡོབ] A mildly deviant type of fighting or &quot;punk&quot; monk who engaged in fighting and other unusual behaviors for monks in traditional Tibet&#x27;s large monasteries.">dobdo</a> called Wöser Tribsel [Tib. འོད་ཟེར་གྲིབ་སེལ] living in the Kalimpong who told me that in a fighting, he stabbed another dobdo on his knees and the other dobdo hit him with a stone which hurt his ears. I didn't know clearly whether he used the stone in a special way like a slingshot?   

**A:**  Yes, he is from <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. སྒོ་མང] One of the large colleges in Drepung Monastery.">Gomang</a> and is about my age. The monks called Wöser were about my age. They would just pick up a stone and hit somebody with it. They didn't have any special way of hitting.   

**Q:**  What is the reason for hitting the pillars with their stick in <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. གཙུག་ལག་ཁང] The famous temple in the center of Lhasa that also housed important government offices, like the Kashag. The Jokhang is part of this temple.">Tsuglagang</a>?   

**A:**  It was said that these pillars were so strong that it could hold the hitting with sticks. If the pillar is not that strong, the pillar might break and the house would fall. There were many pillars like this. But I don't know about this too well.   

**Q:**  Why would they hit it?   

**A:**  There were two reasons; to show off their great strength and to tell the monks to keep quiet and recite the prayers.   

**Q:**  What is the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཕྱག་དམ་པ] The powerful assistant to the Shengo during the Mönlam Chemmo Prayer Festival.">chagdamba</a> [Tib. ཕྱག་དམ་པ]?   

**A:**  The chagdampma is the shengo's running dog [Tib. རྒྱུགས་ཁྱི] who punish people while the shengo would just stand there looking.   

**Q:**  Do the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. དགེ་གཡོག] Monk assistant to the disciplinary official (gegö) in monasteries.">geyog</a> yield under the chagdampa?   

**A:**  They would not yield under the chagdampa, but they act like stylish.   

**Q:**  I heard that when you become the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. དགེ་གཡོག] Monk assistant to the disciplinary official (gegö) in monasteries.">geyog</a> drepa, you have less work than the geyog, right?   

**A:**  Yes. The <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. དགེ་གཡོག] Monk assistant to the disciplinary official (gegö) in monasteries.">geyog</a> dreba has much less work than the junior geyog. For example, if the shengo tells them to dry meat, the junior geyog would go to do that and not the dreba.   

**Q:**  If you are dreba, do you give more money to the shengo?   

**A:**  No it's the same. Altogether there were 19 <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. དགེ་གཡོག] Monk assistant to the disciplinary official (gegö) in monasteries.">geyog</a> who were treated equally. But the younger geyog have to pay more fines to the shanggo shingnyer [Tib. ཞང་གོ་ཤིང་གཉེར] when something went wrong during the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཚོགས] 1. A prayer assembly meeting in monasteries when all the monks come to an assembly hall and chant prayers together. 2. An offering made of tsamba, butter and dry cheese in the shape of a cone.">tsog</a>. Each day there were 3 tsog with tea, löntsog [Tib. རློན་ཚོགས] and 3 tsog without tea, kamtsog [Tib. སྐམ་ཚོགས]. The four drepa pay less for this and they also didn't need to work much. Each geyog has to pay about 8 doste as the fines during Mönlam to the shanggo shingnyer which would be his income.   

**Q:**  The <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. དགེ་གཡོག] Monk assistant to the disciplinary official (gegö) in monasteries.">geyog</a> dreba also don't have to go for patrolling at night, right?   

**A:**  Yes. The shanggo shingnyer gets this income from the fines, but he also had to give a lot to the shengo.   

**Q:**  How much would they have to give?   

**A:**  They had to give more to junior shengo.   

**Q:**  Why did he have to pay more to the junior shengo?   

**A:**  Because the junior shengo was the one who appoint the shanggo shingnyer. Then he give a little less to the senior shengo. The Barkhang <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. དགེ་གཡོག] Monk assistant to the disciplinary official (gegö) in monasteries.">geyog</a> is appointed by the senior shengo.   

**Q:**  If you <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. དགེ་གཡོག] Monk assistant to the disciplinary official (gegö) in monasteries.">geyog</a> have to pay 70 <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. རྡོ་ཚད] A currency unit in traditional Tibet that was equal to 50 ngüsang.">dotse</a> to the shengo, how much would the shanggo shingnyer pay?   

**Q:**  The shanggo shingnyer probably have to give about 100 <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. རྡོ་ཚད] A currency unit in traditional Tibet that was equal to 50 ngüsang.">dotse</a> to each shengo.   

**Q:**  How many <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. དགེ་གཡོག] Monk assistant to the disciplinary official (gegö) in monasteries.">geyog</a> would come from <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. སྡེ་ཡངས] One of the colleges in Drepung Monastery.">Deyang</a>?   

**A:**  There were only two <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. དགེ་གཡོག] Monk assistant to the disciplinary official (gegö) in monasteries.">geyog</a> from the two smaller tratsang. There were more geyog from the two bigger tratsang. [Trindorla; not in the tape. Shanggo shingnyer was originally for the firewood and chagdampa was for carrying water from the well. Later the tratsang built a running water pie so this wasn't necessary]
