## Abstract  

 Rinchen Könchog was a Dobdo monk in Drepung's Deyang College. In this interview, he discusses giving the tonggo ceremony which released him from having to do the "young monk tax" (shöndre), and how monks would take exams on the texts that they had committed to memory. He describes the various positions that monks could hold and how they would be beaten by the gegö (disciplinary officer) with switches when they needed to be punished. He also talks about the monk's salary in grain, including how much they received and where it came from. He then goes on to describe, in great detail, the workings of miser households, farming and the accounting done for the estate (shiga).

**Q:**  Did you have to give a <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. གཏོང་སྒོ] A monastic obligation to provide the food and other necessary items served at a monastic prayer assembly meeting or some other rite; this was often a required obligation for monastic officials at the end of their term of office.">tonggo</a> for the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. གཞོན་ཁྲལ] The work obligations all young monks have to do for the monastery (it literally means &quot;youth tax&quot;).">shöndre</a>?   

**A:**  No, I didn't have to.   

**Q:**  You have to give the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. གཏོང་སྒོ] A monastic obligation to provide the food and other necessary items served at a monastic prayer assembly meeting or some other rite; this was often a required obligation for monastic officials at the end of their term of office.">tonggo</a> to buy out [Tib. བླུ་ཡག] the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. གཞོན་ཁྲལ] The work obligations all young monks have to do for the monastery (it literally means &quot;youth tax&quot;).">shöndre</a>, right?   

**A:**  Yes, I have to give the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. གཏོང་སྒོ] A monastic obligation to provide the food and other necessary items served at a monastic prayer assembly meeting or some other rite; this was often a required obligation for monastic officials at the end of their term of office.">tonggo</a> to buy out the shöndre.   

**Q:**  When did you give this?   

**A:**  I did the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. གཞོན་ཁྲལ] The work obligations all young monks have to do for the monastery (it literally means &quot;youth tax&quot;).">shöndre</a> from the age 16 till in my thirties. Probably, when I was 36, I gave the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. གཏོང་སྒོ] A monastic obligation to provide the food and other necessary items served at a monastic prayer assembly meeting or some other rite; this was often a required obligation for monastic officials at the end of their term of office.">tonggo</a> to buy out the shöndre.   

**Q:**  At that time, you have to serve a <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. གྲྭ་ཇ] The prayer session sponsored by the tratsang (college) at which tea was served to its monks who attended.">traja</a>, right?   

**A:**  Yes. In the past, we would have to serve the rice gruel <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཐུག་པ] 1. A porridge or gruel-like soup typically made with tsamba, and if available, meat and cheese. 2. Noodle dishes in broth.">thukpa</a>. Later, this was said to be too hard for the simple monks, [Tib. གྲྭ་པ་གྲྭ་རྐྱང] so they converted the thukpa into money called substitute of thukpa, thugthö [Tib. ཐུག་དོད]. And you can pay as much you want like 10 <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཏམ་ཀ] A unit in the traditional Tibetan currency system that was equal to 4 sang.">tranka</a>, 2 sang.   

**Q:**  Did you pay the thugthö?   

**A:**  Yes.   

**Q:**  How old are you now?   

**A:**  I am 73 years of age.   

**Q:**  When you bought out the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. གཞོན་ཁྲལ] The work obligations all young monks have to do for the monastery (it literally means &quot;youth tax&quot;).">shöndre</a>, they had already made the thugthö, right?   

**A:**  In the beginning, the thugthö was not made and some filed a kind of law case saying the simple monks were unable to give the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. གཏོང་སྒོ] A monastic obligation to provide the food and other necessary items served at a monastic prayer assembly meeting or some other rite; this was often a required obligation for monastic officials at the end of their term of office.">tonggo</a> to buy out [Tib. བླུ་ཡག] the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. གཞོན་ཁྲལ] The work obligations all young monks have to do for the monastery (it literally means &quot;youth tax&quot;).">shöndre</a> which was called derampa [Tib. འབྲས་རམས་པ]. So it will be good to make the thugthö. If you didn't give this tonggo, then you have to do shöndre even if you are in your 70's.   

**Q:**  If you didn't give the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. གཏོང་སྒོ] A monastic obligation to provide the food and other necessary items served at a monastic prayer assembly meeting or some other rite; this was often a required obligation for monastic officials at the end of their term of office.">tonggo</a> for the derampa [Tib. འབྲས་རམས་པ], you can't become the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. དགེ་སྐོས] The main disciplinary official in a monastic college (tratsang).">gegö</a>, right?   

**A:**  Yes. After buying out the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. གཞོན་ཁྲལ] The work obligations all young monks have to do for the monastery (it literally means &quot;youth tax&quot;).">shöndre</a>, the turn for the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. དགེ་སྐོས] The main disciplinary official in a monastic college (tratsang).">gegö</a> will come.   

**Q:**  You didn't get the turn to be the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. དགེ་སྐོས] The main disciplinary official in a monastic college (tratsang).">gegö</a>, right?   

**A:**  Yes.   

**Q:**  If the revolt hadn't occured, you would have eventually got the turn, right?   

**A:**  Yes. This turn goes according the list of the time you gave the tonggo.   

**Q:**  Once in a year, regardlesss of the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. བླ་རྒྱུད་པ] A term for the common monks in a monastery (in contrast to the scholar monks who were actively studying the Buddhist doctrine).">lagyüba</a> or <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. དཔེ་ཆ་བ] A monk studying the monastic philosophical curriculum. A scholar monk.">pechawa</a>, you have to take a major exam in the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. chöra (ཆོས་ར)] The walled-in grove in monasteries (monastic colleges) where monks go to study/practice debating.">dharma grove</a>, <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཆོས་ར] The special grove (&quot;dharma grove&quot;) in monasteries where monks formally met to practice debating.">chöra</a> [Tib. ཆོར་ར] called gyugchen [Tib. རྒྱུགས་ཆེན], right?   

**A:**  Yes, we have to take it once in a year after the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཚོགས་མཆོད] The large religious prayer festival held in Lhasa in the 2nd Tibetan lunar month.">Tsongjö</a> in the 4th lunar month.   

**Q:**  For the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. བླ་རྒྱུད་པ] A term for the common monks in a monastery (in contrast to the scholar monks who were actively studying the Buddhist doctrine).">lagyüba</a>, what kind of exam would you have to take?   

**A:**  We take the exam on whatever kind of texts that one had committed [Tib. ཁས་ལེན] to recite. It doesn't matter even if we couldn't take it completely. They wouldn't say anything because normally we do the works for the monastery like building some small houses. As for the big houses they call the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. མི་སེར] A term that can mean serf/bound subject as well as citizen, depending on context. For example, the miser of a lord would connote the bound subjects of that lord, whereas the miser of Tibet would connote citizens of Tibet.">miser</a> and we do other works such as carrying skin bag/loads of butter and rice from here and there. Because we do all these works, when there is the exam, they don't enforce [Tib. བདའ་འདེད] it on us very much.   

**Q:**  Anyway, you have to take the exam and recite somthing in front of the abbot, right?   

**A:**  We wouldn't need to take it in front of the abbot. The exam is given by the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. དགེ་སྐོས] The main disciplinary official in a monastic college (tratsang).">gegö</a>, umdze and lama shunglenba [Tib. བླ་མ་གཞུང་ལེན་པ]. The abbot comes, but he examines only the better <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. དཔེ་ཆ་བ] A monk studying the monastic philosophical curriculum. A scholar monk.">pechawa</a> and that is also strict where ours was not strict.   

**Q:**  Do you go individually to give the exam?   

**A:**  No, 3 of us go at once. We recite whatever we can and if we didn't have any more to recite, we just stay there and then the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. དགེ་སྐོས] The main disciplinary official in a monastic college (tratsang).">gegö</a> and umdze go to the abbot and say they are finished with their exam and then we leave. The <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. དཔེ་ཆ་བ] A monk studying the monastic philosophical curriculum. A scholar monk.">pechawa</a> takes the exam one by one.   

**Q:**  Did you have to take the exam every year even you reach 50-60 years old?   

**A:**  This we do every year, even if we are old.   

**Q:**  Couldn't you buy out the exam?   

**A:**  No.   

**Q:**  In <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. སྡེ་ཡངས] One of the colleges in Drepung Monastery.">Deyang</a>, if you didn't give the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. གཏོང་སྒོ] A monastic obligation to provide the food and other necessary items served at a monastic prayer assembly meeting or some other rite; this was often a required obligation for monastic officials at the end of their term of office.">tonggo</a> for the derampa, you can't go up from the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. བསྡུས་ཆེན] The third class in the düdra monastic curriculum.">düchen</a> grade, right?   

**A:**  Yes. You have to remain in the düchen. If you gave the derampa <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. གཏོང་སྒོ] A monastic obligation to provide the food and other necessary items served at a monastic prayer assembly meeting or some other rite; this was often a required obligation for monastic officials at the end of their term of office.">tonggo</a>, you move up to <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. རྟགས་རིགས] The next to last class in the düdra monastic curriculum.">tagrik</a>, <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. བློ་རིགས] The last class/level in the düdra monastic curriculum. This is the end of the phase of memorizing texts.">lurik</a>, namdren [Tib. རྣམ་འདྲེན], pharchin [Tib. ཕར་ཕྱིན] etc .   

**Q:**  Do you get promoted every year?   

**A:**  Not every year, after some time, the abbot would tell us a time for the promotion.   

**Q:**  The Pechawa have the different grades, but as for the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. བླ་རྒྱུད་པ] A term for the common monks in a monastery (in contrast to the scholar monks who were actively studying the Buddhist doctrine).">lagyüba</a>, what difference does it make whether you are in <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. རྟགས་རིགས] The next to last class in the düdra monastic curriculum.">tagrik</a> or <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. བློ་རིགས] The last class/level in the düdra monastic curriculum. This is the end of the phase of memorizing texts.">lurik</a>?   

**A:**  If you couldn't give the derampa <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. གཏོང་སྒོ] A monastic obligation to provide the food and other necessary items served at a monastic prayer assembly meeting or some other rite; this was often a required obligation for monastic officials at the end of their term of office.">tonggo</a>, you stay in <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. བསྡུས་ཆེན] The third class in the düdra monastic curriculum.">düchen</a> and do the shöndre. If you gave the derampa tonggo, then you move up from the greads like <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. རྟགས་རིགས] The next to last class in the düdra monastic curriculum.">tagrik</a> etc. As for the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. བླ་རྒྱུད་པ] A term for the common monks in a monastery (in contrast to the scholar monks who were actively studying the Buddhist doctrine).">lagyüba</a>, they call you seniors [tib rgan pa] when you become older. Then after you become <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. དགེ་སྐོས] The main disciplinary official in a monastic college (tratsang).">gegö</a>, you get the grease [Tib. ཞག] on the tea in the thsog. Otherwise you don't get any grease.   

**Q:**  As for the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. བླ་རྒྱུད་པ] A term for the common monks in a monastery (in contrast to the scholar monks who were actively studying the Buddhist doctrine).">lagyüba</a>, even if they are in the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. རྟགས་རིགས] The next to last class in the düdra monastic curriculum.">tagrik</a> and <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. བློ་རིགས] The last class/level in the düdra monastic curriculum. This is the end of the phase of memorizing texts.">lurik</a>, I think they don't go to the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཆོས་ར] The special grove (&quot;dharma grove&quot;) in monasteries where monks formally met to practice debating.">chöra</a>?   

**A:**  No, they do have to go, but the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. བླ་རྒྱུད་པ] A term for the common monks in a monastery (in contrast to the scholar monks who were actively studying the Buddhist doctrine).">lagyüba</a> are treated a little bit specially. But it's not okay if we just don't go. The <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. དགེ་སྐོས] The main disciplinary official in a monastic college (tratsang).">gegö</a> says "those below me in rank have to go to <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཚོག] 1. An offering made of tsamba, butter and dry cheese in the shape of a cone. 2. A prayer assembly meeting in monasteries when all the monks come to an assembly hall and chant prayers together.">tshog</a>/chöra, those above me don't have to come in tshog /chöra" [Tib. ང་མན་ཆད་ཚོགས་ཆོས་ར་འགྲིམ་དགོས་ཡོད། ང་ཡན་ཆད་ཚོགས་ཆོས་ར་འགྲིམ་དགོས་མ་རེད].   

**Q:**  There were three sessions of <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཆོས་ར] The special grove (&quot;dharma grove&quot;) in monasteries where monks formally met to practice debating.">chöra</a>; morning session, <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཞོགས་ཆོས] The morning chöra (debating) session.">shogchö</a>, [Tib. ཞོགས་ཆོས], miday session, <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཉིན་ཆོས] A mid-day study session in monasteries.">nyinchö</a> [Tib. ཉིན་ཆོས] etc, right?   

**A:**  Yes, there were <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཞོགས་ཆོས] The morning chöra (debating) session.">shogchö</a>, <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཉིན་ཆོས] A mid-day study session in monasteries.">nyinchö</a> and ritual, <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. སྐུ་རིམ] A religious prayer service for monks.">kurim</a> [Tib. སྐུ་རིམ].   

**Q:**  If you go to the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཉིན་ཆོས] A mid-day study session in monasteries.">nyinchö</a>, mostly it is the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. མཚན་ཉིད] Buddhist dialectics. This is taught after the six-year curriculum called düdra.">tsenyi</a> degate, right?   

**A:**  First they would recite the prayers called Dukar [Tib. གདུགས་དཀར] and the Shenying [Tib. ཤེས་སྙིང] and after reciting the prayers, they gather together in each grade [Tib. རུག་ཚོགས].   

**Q:**  As this time, do the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. བླ་རྒྱུད་པ] A term for the common monks in a monastery (in contrast to the scholar monks who were actively studying the Buddhist doctrine).">lagyüba</a> go back?   

**A:**  Then after this is over, the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. དགེ་སྐོས] The main disciplinary official in a monastic college (tratsang).">gegö</a> would tell the elder <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. བླ་རྒྱུད་པ] A term for the common monks in a monastery (in contrast to the scholar monks who were actively studying the Buddhist doctrine).">lagyüba</a> to leave. After we leave, then the gegö would tell the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཁ་དོག་དཀར་དམར] The first class or stage in the monastic düdra curriculum.">khatog garmar</a> and <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. བསྡུས་གྲྭ] The first curriculum in Buddhist dialectics in Gelugpa monasteries. It is an abbreviated course in logic (tib. ཙེམ [ཚད་མ]). There are 6 classes and monks ideally study one class each year. The first class is khatog garmar [tib. ཁ་དོག་དཀར་དམར], followed by düdring [tib. བསྡུས་འབྲིང], then düchen [tib. བསྡུས་ཆེན], then tagrik [tib. རྟགས་རིག], and then finally lurik [tib. བླུ་རིག].">düdra</a> to leave. Then the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. དཔེ་ཆ་བ] A monk studying the monastic philosophical curriculum. A scholar monk.">pechawa</a> would debate <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. མཚན་ཉིད] Buddhist dialectics. This is taught after the six-year curriculum called düdra.">tsenyi</a> for an hour or two.   

**Q:**  Is <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཞོགས་ཆོས] The morning chöra (debating) session.">shogchö</a> the same like this?   

**A:**  Its about the same. The <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. དགེ་སྐོས] The main disciplinary official in a monastic college (tratsang).">gegö</a> stands up watching over the discipline and the umdze starts the prayers.   

**Q:**  Does the undze come?   

**A:**  He comes all the time and is critical because we had to start the prayers.   

**Q:**  Does the lama shunglenba come everyday?   

**A:**  No, he dosn't come. The umdze leads the prayers and then he leaves first. Then we, the older <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. བླ་རྒྱུད་པ] A term for the common monks in a monastery (in contrast to the scholar monks who were actively studying the Buddhist doctrine).">lagyüba</a> leave who have given the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. གཏོང་སྒོ] A monastic obligation to provide the food and other necessary items served at a monastic prayer assembly meeting or some other rite; this was often a required obligation for monastic officials at the end of their term of office.">tonggo</a> of derampa. Then those who haven't done derampa would be allowd to leave later. The <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. དགེ་སྐོས] The main disciplinary official in a monastic college (tratsang).">gegö</a> is the disciplinary official in the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཆོས་ར] The special grove (&quot;dharma grove&quot;) in monasteries where monks formally met to practice debating.">chöra</a>, <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. གྲྭ་ཇ] The prayer session sponsored by the tratsang (college) at which tea was served to its monks who attended.">traja</a> and kurim.   

**Q:**  When you go to the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཆོས་ར] The special grove (&quot;dharma grove&quot;) in monasteries where monks formally met to practice debating.">chöra</a>, do you stay in the different grades or do you just stay like a <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཚོགས] 1. A prayer assembly meeting in monasteries when all the monks come to an assembly hall and chant prayers together. 2. An offering made of tsamba, butter and dry cheese in the shape of a cone.">tsog</a>?   

**A:**  First we stay in the grades and after awhile, we gather together where we recite the prayers like Dukar etc.   

**Q:**  Were there cushions to sit on in the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཆོས་ར] The special grove (&quot;dharma grove&quot;) in monasteries where monks formally met to practice debating.">chöra</a>?   

**A:**  No there weren't. We sit with our cloak draped over us. Shogchö is not long, only about 1 hour. <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. སྐུ་རིམ] A religious prayer service for monks.">kurim</a> is the hardest. It is about 7 pm (when we start) and goes on till about 10 pm. We recite 21 Drölma [Tib. སྒྲོལ་མ] prayers. There are many differnt rituals like chasum [Tib. ཆ་གསུམ] etc. If the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ལྡབ་ལྡོབ] A mildly deviant type of fighting or &quot;punk&quot; monk who engaged in fighting and other unusual behaviors for monks in traditional Tibet&#x27;s large monasteries.">dobdo</a> and other <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. བླ་རྒྱུད་པ] A term for the common monks in a monastery (in contrast to the scholar monks who were actively studying the Buddhist doctrine).">lagyüba</a> come to the kurim, then no one would say anything if you don't go to <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཞོགས་ཆོས] The morning chöra (debating) session.">shogchö</a> and nyinchö. If we go to the kurim, we recite the prayes we know loudly, so we were regarded highly. Otherwise, the dobdo have some exemptions because they have to do the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. གཞོན་ཁྲལ] The work obligations all young monks have to do for the monastery (it literally means &quot;youth tax&quot;).">shöndre</a> which was like the ula. The old society's rules were very just and fair. They would never falsely accuse people. If you break the law, then you get punihsed.   

**Q:**  They make the judgement right away and people would not get imprisoned, right?   

**A:**  Yes. They would take them down and raise their lower garment up and beat them on their bottom with switches and then it is finished.   

**Q:**  You were one of those who held the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. དགེ་སྐོས] The main disciplinary official in a monastic college (tratsang).">gegö</a>'s legs while they were beaten, right?   

**A:**  Yes. This was also shöndre. The high rankings would call us mentioning our names. If we didn't go, we would get beaten on our bottom.   

**Q:**  Was it at night when they called you?   

**A:**  I was called before it was dark.   

**Q:**  Did the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཕྱག་སྦུག] A manager (of estates and endowments) of a monastic college or monastic khamtsen.">chabu</a> call you?   

**A:**  The abbot called us while they were holding the tsondu. They beat both of the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. དགེ་སྐོས] The main disciplinary official in a monastic college (tratsang).">gegö</a>. After the beatings, the gegö were put in separate rooms. The new gegö was put in the room under the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཕྱག་སྦུག] A manager (of estates and endowments) of a monastic college or monastic khamtsen.">chabu</a> rungkhang of which the door is faced to this side. The old gegö was put in a room on the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. སྡེ་ཡངས] One of the colleges in Drepung Monastery.">Deyang</a> roof. That night, I was told to guard the old gegö because they were afraid that he will flee.   

**Q:**  Did you hold the feet or hands?   

**A:**  I held the feet.   

**Q:**  Who were the ones who beat them with switches ?   

**A:**  The <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཕྱག་སྦུག] A manager (of estates and endowments) of a monastic college or monastic khamtsen.">chabu</a> beat them.   

**Q:**  Which <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཕྱག་སྦུག] A manager (of estates and endowments) of a monastic college or monastic khamtsen.">chabu</a>?   

**A:**  I mean not real <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཕྱག་སྦུག] A manager (of estates and endowments) of a monastic college or monastic khamtsen.">chabu</a> but were the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཚོགས་འདུ] 1. The general name for the various types of Tibetan government assemblies. 2. Any assembly, e.g., the assembly (meeting) of monks in a college.">tsondu</a> members; Mönlamla [Tib. སྨོན་ལམ་ལགས], lengdenla [Tib. ལེགས་ལྡན་ལགས], Shenyen Thuwangla [Tib. བཤེས་གཉེན་ཐུབ་དབང་ལགས]. It was about 4 people who did the beatings.   

**Q:**  Did they hit them with the switches or did they poke them with the switches?   

**A:**  They beat them with the switches called Tsarpa [Tib. ཚར་པ] and later the switches cracked which made them have severe sores and they were bleeding.   

**Q:**  I heard that broken pieces of switches even stuck in their bottom.   

**A:**  Yes, it stuck them and they were killed under the beating.   

**Q:**  Did they also beat them on the next day?   

**A:**  No they didn't. But they beat them again on the third day [Tib. གནངས] which was a kind of rule. They would not beat them continuously. They were quite old, so they died. At that time, if you steal and kill people, they beat them like this.   

**Q:**  Did they die in the room or in their <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. 1. ཤག, 2. ཞག] 1. The apartment/room of a monk. 2. The butter fat that coagulates on the top of butter-tea when the tea is left to sit for some time. If the tea had been made with a lot of butter, this layer could be thick enough to scoop off and save to later sell or eat separately. The senior monks are usually served tea with a lot of shag.">shag</a>?   

**A:**  They died in their <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. 1. ཤག, 2. ཞག] 1. The apartment/room of a monk. 2. The butter fat that coagulates on the top of butter-tea when the tea is left to sit for some time. If the tea had been made with a lot of butter, this layer could be thick enough to scoop off and save to later sell or eat separately. The senior monks are usually served tea with a lot of shag.">shag</a>. The friends of the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. དགེ་སྐོས] The main disciplinary official in a monastic college (tratsang).">gegö</a> bailed them out and took them to their shag and guaranteed they wouldnt run away.   

**Q:**  At that time, didn't the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. གྲྭ་དམངས] An ordinary or common monk.">tramang</a> made a kind of commotion [Tib. འུར]?   

**A:**  No. They wouldn't do that because they didn't have the custom [Tib. ལུགས] of doing that.   

**Q:**  What was the main reason for beating the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. དགེ་སྐོས] The main disciplinary official in a monastic college (tratsang).">gegö</a>?   

**A:**  We didn't really know because we were like servants. There must have been something with the high ranking where they didn't get along well with them.

**A:**  No. They couldn't because they were more powerful than the gegö.   

**Q:**  How did you get the post of shidü? Did you ask for that?   

**A:**  I didn't ask. As I told you last time, out of about 20 candidate the deity picked 9 and approved it by putting red mark on the names. Of these 9, 6 went to <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. གཞིས་ཀ] A manorial estate.">shiga</a> as shidü and 3 stayed in the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. གཉེར་ཚང] 1. Storehouse. 2.

Then for about one year the new nyertsang takes over the principals of loans gradually from the old nyertsang and start to give out loans. During that one year, we didn't need to give tonggo.

Then I return to the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. གཞིས་ཀ] A manorial estate.">shiga</a> and give them the food that they need.   

**Q:**  One shidü is in charge of the giving loans and the other is the in charge of planting the fields, right?   

**A:**  No. The <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. གཞིས་ཀ] A manorial estate.">shiga</a> itself wouldn't give loans. The two shidü had slightly divided the work. One did mostly the internal works staying in the house and one was mainly in charge of plowing, planting and these activities.   

**Q:**  Who give the loans?   

**A:**  The old <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. གཉེར་ཚང] 1. Storehouse. 2. Steward, person in charge of a storehouse. 3. A monastic official in charge of storerooms.">nyertsang</a> would hand over the loan principals and then the new nyertsang nangyer give the loans. Actually, 9 of us were doing the same working.   

**Q:**  So the shidü would not take over the grain loans, right?   

**A:**  Yes. When we first take over the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. གཞིས་ཀ] A manorial estate.">shiga</a>, we don't lend out, instead we take loans. Then in subsequent years if we get a good harvest, we would lend out grain loans. If the yield is not good, then we don't have grain to give loans.   

**Q:**  How long did you work as shidü?   

**A:**  Three years. The term was 6 years but the revolt took place.   

**Q:**  When you took over the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. གཞིས་ཀ] A manorial estate.">shiga</a>, the seed for the next planting was kept in the shiga, right?

We get little over 1,000 khe of grain from outside. The rest of the grain salary had to be provided by Deyang Shiga and we transport the grain to Lhasa three times. After the harvest, we put the grain to be used for monks salary in a separate section of the grain storeroom. When we do this, we fill a bo measure with <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. རྩམ་པ] The traditional Tibetan staple food that consists of grain that is roasted (popped), usually in heated sand, and then ground into a flour.">tsamba</a>, then we fill a pot with <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. 1. ཆང, 2. བྱང] 1.

**Q:**  How much yield did you get from the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. གཞིས་ཀ] A manorial estate.">shiga</a> ?   

**A:**  About 2,000 of <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཁལ] A traditional volume measurement used for measuring grain in traditional Tibetan society.

For example, a field said to be 10 khe in size meant that 10 khe of seed could be sown on that field.">khe</a>. The land is located in the upper part of valley, so we only get 4-5 khe from one khe of seed. The fields in the lower part of the valley got about 10 times yield the seed they planted.

**A:**  Yes. We irrigate the land. <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. སྡེ་ཡངས] One of the colleges in Drepung Monastery.">Deyang</a> Shiga was actually the owner of the stream flowing down from the upper part of the valley.

**A:**  We used 6 sets of <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. མཛོ] A cross between a yak and a cow/ox.">dzo</a> for planting and we had little over 20 dzo. We would have to make two shifts to switch the 12 dzo off.   

**Q:**  How many days would it take for the spring plowing?   

**A:**  It takes about 2 months to plant this area. First we plow the land right after the harvest, this is to plow under the stalks which is called Thagog [Tib. མཐའ་གོག྄] and the 2nd plowing is called Logog [Tib. ལོ་གོག]. The 3rd is called Jingma [Tib. བྱིང་མ] where we plow the land and then use the harrow to level the land and then leave it. All these are done before planting.

These tratsang were property owning corporate entities and included monks who were organized into residential dormitories called Khamtsen.">tratsang</a> and you give more if the yield is good and less when the yield is not good, right?   

**A:**  No. We have to give each monk in <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. སྡེ་ཡངས] One of the colleges in Drepung Monastery.">Deyang</a> 4 <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཁལ] A traditional volume measurement used for measuring grain in traditional Tibetan society. Sizes of this unit varied somewhat, but the official government khe (called mkhar ru or bstan dzin mkha ru) weighed about 28-31 pounds for barley. It was used to convey the size of fields. For example, a field said to be 10 khe in size meant that 10 khe of seed could be sown on that field.">khe</a> of grain whether we have a good year or bad one. We give just this much. Usually either in the 10th or 12th lunar month we send that. The threshing would not be finished even after the New Year because we had a large area of land. When we send the grain for monk's salary, the senior shidü comes to the tratsang.   

**Q:**  Do you take back the left over grain?   

**A:**  No. If there is left over grain after the salary is paid, the surplus is kept by the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. གཉེར་ཚང] 1. Storehouse. 2. Steward, person in charge of a storehouse. 3. A monastic official in charge of storerooms.">nyertsang</a> in their storehouse. The nyertsang would exchange this for butter to be used in the traja.   

**Q:**  So the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. གཉེར་ཚང] 1. Storehouse. 2. Steward, person in charge of a storehouse. 3. A monastic official in charge of storerooms.">nyertsang</a> and the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. གཞིས་ཀ] A manorial estate.">shiga</a> was managed together, right?   

**A:**  Yes. Among the nine monks, the elder ones were chosen to work for the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. གཉེར་ཚང] 1. Storehouse. 2. Steward, person in charge of a storehouse. 3. A monastic official in charge of storerooms.">nyertsang</a> and the younger ones with farming experience would be sent as shidü. The three monks in the nyertsang's office in monastery lend out grain loans and the 6 on the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. གཞིས་ཀ] A manorial estate.">shiga</a> mainly do the planting.   

**Q:**  How much grain did you send to the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. གཉེར་ཚང] 1. Storehouse. 2. Steward, person in charge of a storehouse. 3. A monastic official in charge of storerooms.">nyertsang</a> in each year when you were the shidü ?   

**A:**  There are 500 monks and we must give 4 <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཁལ] A traditional volume measurement used for measuring grain in traditional Tibetan society. Sizes of this unit varied somewhat, but the official government khe (called mkhar ru or bstan dzin mkha ru) weighed about 28-31 pounds for barley. It was used to convey the size of fields. For example, a field said to be 10 khe in size meant that 10 khe of seed could be sown on that field.">khe</a> per monk so the total is 2,000 Khe. We get in about 1,000 from the lease, so the remaining 1,000 we give from <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. སྡེ་ཡངས] One of the colleges in Drepung Monastery.">Deyang</a> shiga. Deyang shiga also makes all the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. གཉེར་ཚང] 1. Storehouse. 2. Steward, person in charge of a storehouse. 3. A monastic official in charge of storerooms.">nyertsang</a>'s <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. རྩམ་པ] The traditional Tibetan staple food that consists of grain that is roasted (popped), usually in heated sand, and then ground into a flour.">tsamba</a> for the year. And then also we set aside for the next year's seed. The exceess is used by the nyertsang. I stayed for only 3 years, but had I been there for 6 years, at the end of my term I would have sold eveything like the animals etc to the new shidü. The new shidü has to buy the things like <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. མཛོ] A cross between a yak and a cow/ox.">dzo</a>, donkeys and farming equipments etc. And if we had a good yield, we would serve a <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. མང་ཇ] The morning tea served to monks from all the monastic colleges at the main prayer assembly hall.">mangja</a> and give alms to the monks and also leave endowments [Tib. སྤྱི་འཇོག]. There is no loss.   

**Q:**  Anyway, you have to do an accounting [Tib. རྩིས་རྒྱག] between the new and the old, right?   

**A:**  Yes, there was an accounting in each year. The <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. གཉེར་ཚང] 1. Storehouse. 2. Steward, person in charge of a storehouse. 3. A monastic official in charge of storerooms.">nyertsang</a> had the endowments for giving the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. གཏོང་སྒོ] A monastic obligation to provide the food and other necessary items served at a monastic prayer assembly meeting or some other rite; this was often a required obligation for monastic officials at the end of their term of office.">tonggo</a> and they would give loans from that. The new shidü have to buy all the things in the shiga.   

**Q:**  You don't have money to pay right away, right?   

**A:**  Yes, we don't need to pay right away. After 6 years we also sell all the things to the new shidü. There is no way of doing things carelessly [Tib. བ་རེ་བོ་རེ]. At the end of the 6 years, all the six shidü and three people from the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. གཉེར་ཚང] 1. Storehouse. 2. Steward, person in charge of a storehouse. 3. A monastic official in charge of storerooms.">nyertsang</a> would meet and do all the accounts on the income and the expenditures. The shidü at this time, would ask the nyertsang how many loans they had to take. The nyertsang definitely would have to take loans. The excess from the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. གཞིས་ཀ] A manorial estate.">shiga</a> would be used to repay the loans for the nyertsang.   

**Q:**  At your time how many things did you buy?   

**A:**  I bought alot.   

**Q:**  Did you pay like 100 <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. རྡོ་ཚད] A currency unit in traditional Tibet that was equal to 50 ngüsang.">dotse</a>?   

**A:**  It is more than that. For example, a donkey cost like 100 <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. རྡོ་ཚད] A currency unit in traditional Tibet that was equal to 50 ngüsang.">dotse</a>, so it was alot to pay because there were 10 donkeys and there were over 20 <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. མཛོ] A cross between a yak and a cow/ox.">dzo</a> which cost a lot.   

**Q:**  So it would have been several thousands of <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. རྡོ་ཚད] A currency unit in traditional Tibet that was equal to 50 ngüsang.">dotse</a>, right?   

**A:**  When I bought everything from the old shidü, it was worth a little less than 10,000 dotse. It didn't matter about paying this out because if we have a good harvest, these things were all capitals. For example, if we had a donkey and it died, it was no loss since due to its work till it's death from which we had made the income.   

**Q:**  Supposing it cost about 9,000 for the things you bought, you didn't need to pay the money right away, right?   

**A:**  Yes.   

**Q:**  So how would you make the payment eventually?   

**A:**  Trindor: It looks like that they didn't pay in cash, they just count the cost of the things when they take over the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. གཞིས་ཀ] A manorial estate.">shiga</a> and when they hand over the shiga to the next shidü, for example, they would say,"when I took over the shiga, I bought the things that cost 7, 000 <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. རྡོ་ཚད] A currency unit in traditional Tibet that was equal to 50 ngüsang.">dotse</a> and now I am selling you the things which cost 8, 000 dotse".   

**A:**  Yes. This is right. If we bought the things which cost 8,000 <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. རྡོ་ཚད] A currency unit in traditional Tibet that was equal to 50 ngüsang.">dotse</a>, we won't suffer loss during 6 years. For example, All the things including chickens we bought during the 6 years are listed. When we hand over the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. གཞིས་ཀ] A manorial estate.">shiga</a>, we say, "the things we have, cost this much capital, so we won't sell it less than that amount to the new shidü". The new shidü has no choice but to buy it, since it is the time to do the autumn plowing and they have to use the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. མཛོ] A cross between a yak and a cow/ox.">dzo</a> and donkeys. We had 8 milch cows. The butter from the 8 cows are used for shidü's food and for performing rituals.   

**Q:**  Do you keep the excess of the things?   

**A:**  No, we don't keep anything. It is used for the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. གཉེར་ཚང] 1. Storehouse. 2. Steward, person in charge of a storehouse. 3. A monastic official in charge of storerooms.">nyertsang</a> for paying their loss.   

**Q:**  How would the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. གཉེར་ཚང] 1. Storehouse. 2. Steward, person in charge of a storehouse. 3. A monastic official in charge of storerooms.">nyertsang</a> suffer loss?   

**A:**  During the 6 years, the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. གཉེར་ཚང] 1. Storehouse. 2. Steward, person in charge of a storehouse. 3. A monastic official in charge of storerooms.">nyertsang</a> had to serve the regular <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. གྲྭ་ཇ] The prayer session sponsored by the tratsang (college) at which tea was served to its monks who attended.">traja</a>. The nyertsang runs at a loss of its endowment due to the inflation. For example, if there is an endowment of 16 <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. སྲང] A unit of traditional Tibetan currency. It was also called ngüsang [tib. དངུལ་སྲང]. 50 nügsang = 1 dotse; 10 sho = 1 nügsang; 20 5-karma coins = 1 ngüsang. There were also paper currency notes of 7-sang, 25-sang, and 10-sang denominations.">sang</a> in the past which was then meant for serving a traja, now you can't serve a traja with 16 sang. This loss was made up from the profit from the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. གཞིས་ཀ] A manorial estate.">shiga</a> which was accumulated by the hard work of the shidü. After 6 years accounting of the shiga, we would ask the nyertsang how much loans they took and if the nyertysang tells an amount of the loans, we don't at first say we have a lot of proift. For example, if we have grain or money worth of 10,000 <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. རྡོ་ཚད] A currency unit in traditional Tibet that was equal to 50 ngüsang.">dotse</a>, we say we only have 8,000 dotse.   

**Q:**  Was there any salary for the shidü?   

**A:**  No. None at all. Shidü was a tax for the smaller <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. གྲྭ་ཚང] A &quot;college&quot; within a monastery, for example, in Drepung Monastery there were four main tratsang: Gomang, Loseling, Deyang and Ngagpa. These tratsang were property owning corporate entities and included monks who were organized into residential dormitories called Khamtsen.">tratsang</a>. The bigger tratsang's shidü have salary. While we are living on the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. གཞིས་ཀ] A manorial estate.">shiga</a>, there is free food as much as we wanted and we get the alms and the salary shares from the Mönlam and tratsang which they collect for us. But, it was not much, it might be like 30 <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. རྡོ་ཚད] A currency unit in traditional Tibet that was equal to 50 ngüsang.">dotse</a> per year.   

**Q:**  Do you get any extra shares?   

**A:**  No. We get the same. We, the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ལྡབ་ལྡོབ] A mildly deviant type of fighting or &quot;punk&quot; monk who engaged in fighting and other unusual behaviors for monks in traditional Tibet&#x27;s large monasteries.">dobdo</a> do this as a tax or obligation.   

**Q:**  If a son splits from the household, can the household let them plant some of their fields temporarily?   

**A:**  Yes, if they have a lot of fields they can do that. We don't get involved in this internal stuff at all. As long as they provide the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. འུལ་ལག] A generic term for corvée labor that had to be performed for one&#x27;s manorial estate/lord without pay. One kind of ula required people to go and work and another kind required the provision of transportation animals.">ula</a>, they could do whatever they like.   

**Q:**  But can they divide the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཁྲལ་རྐང] The name of the basic tax unit for arable land in traditional Tibetan society. Families with farm land would have one or more fields of different sizes, e.g., 1 tregang or 1/2 of a tregang. This was defined by a fixed number of khe of seed (tib. sönkhe) that would be sown on that field. For example, one tregang in some areas would consist of 10 sönkhe. There was substantial variation between and within regions and types of estates.">tregang</a>?   

**A:**  No, they weren't allowed to do this. If they have a fight and split family, they have to report the shidü. The shidü would say "you can't make the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཁྲལ་རྐང] The name of the basic tax unit for arable land in traditional Tibetan society. Families with farm land would have one or more fields of different sizes, e.g., 1 tregang or 1/2 of a tregang. This was defined by a fixed number of khe of seed (tib. sönkhe) that would be sown on that field. For example, one tregang in some areas would consist of 10 sönkhe. There was substantial variation between and within regions and types of estates.">tregang</a> to become scattered [Tib. ཐོར] and you have to take the responsibility. If the tregang get scattered, it will not be good for you." They would say this in an serious manner. For example, if the father is <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. སྡེ་ཡངས] One of the colleges in Drepung Monastery.">Deyang</a> miser and mother is not Deyang miser, since they joined the tregang, there is no differnce whether she is Deyang miser or not.   

**Q:**  For example, if a family has a son and a wife living separately and the household internally lets them plant some land, would the shidü get involved?   

**A:**  No, we won't as long as the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. འུལ་ལག] A generic term for corvée labor that had to be performed for one&#x27;s manorial estate/lord without pay. One kind of ula required people to go and work and another kind required the provision of transportation animals.">ula</a> is sent.   

**Q:**  Can this become permanent for some later generations?   

**A:**  No. It's only for a few years where they let them plant it. They would not let them plant permanently because the land belonged to the shiga. When some land investigation comes this will cause trouble when they check the lands.   

**Q:**  Would they do the investigation yearly?   

**A:**  No. It is done ocassionally all of a sudden without warning.   

**Q:**  So the father of the household had a great power, right?   

**A:**  Yes.   

**Q:**  If the son didn't obey the father and get separated, would he get his land share?   

**A:**  No. He can't argue for the land, but he can argue for a share of things.   

**Q:**  Do they often therefore marry polyandrously?   

**A:**  There were some, but not usually since they won't get along well.   

**Q:**  So what do they do usually when they get married ?   

**A:**  The elder son get married and stays at home.   

**Q:**  What would the younger ones do?   

**Q:**  The younger sons find wives and leave the main household. Most were like this. Usually, the sons would not get along well in the family.   

**Q:**  So the sons living outside would not get the land, so would they take lands for lease?   

**A:**  If the family let them plant some of their fields for a few years, they plant it and they also can take 2-3 lands for lease from others. amd pay 2-3 of grain as the lease. There was also the way of leasing where the half of the yield goes to the planter and the half goes to the owner.   

**Q:**  Sometimes, would they take the land for the lease and instead of paying grain, they work for some days for the owner of the land?   

**A:**  Yes, there were.   

**Q:**  What if one of these boys and his wife says he wants to leave and go to Lhasa, could he do that? Do they have to report the shidü?   

**A:**  Probably the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. གཞིས་ཀ] A manorial estate.">shiga</a> would not let them go. But if his wife was from Lhasa and the son says he wants to go Lhasa, we let them go because his wife lives there. We are primarily interested in the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཁྲལ་རྐང] The name of the basic tax unit for arable land in traditional Tibetan society. Families with farm land would have one or more fields of different sizes, e.g., 1 tregang or 1/2 of a tregang. This was defined by a fixed number of khe of seed (tib. sönkhe) that would be sown on that field. For example, one tregang in some areas would consist of 10 sönkhe. There was substantial variation between and within regions and types of estates.">tregang</a> providing 1 ula.   

**Q:**  How many days do the dunamba work?   

**A:**  About 3-4 days.   

**Q:**  Would they make them work in spring?   

**A:**  We make them work in spring and autumn because these were the most critical season and we give them one <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. བྲེ] A unit of traditional volume measurement [a container] in Tibet, 20 of which typically equaled one khe or bo [also a container], although in some areas there were only 16 dre in one khe.">dre</a> and three phü [Tib. འཕུལ] of <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. རྩམ་པ] The traditional Tibetan staple food that consists of grain that is roasted (popped), usually in heated sand, and then ground into a flour.">tsamba</a>, tea and chang.   

**Q:**  Do you give food to the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཁྲལ་པ] The class of bound peasant/miser/serf households who held farmland and had to fulfill large corvée tax obligations to their manorial estates/lords. They are often called taxpayer households in English. While some of these were well off by local standards, many were poor due to a variety of factors such as heavy debts and a dearth of able-bodied workers in their households.">treba</a> ula?   

**A:**  No. Because they have fields.   

**Q:**  If there is a dispute on the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. གཞིས་ཀ] A manorial estate.">shiga</a>, can you two shidü settle the case?   

**A:**  Yes. There are no big disputes. If the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. མི་སེར] A term that can mean serf/bound subject as well as citizen, depending on context. For example, the miser of a lord would connote the bound subjects of that lord, whereas the miser of Tibet would connote citizens of Tibet.">miser</a> have an interal verbal fighting among the family members, the shidü would mediate and say don't do like this. And we would not fine them, they were our own miser.   

**Q:**  What would happen if there is a big fight?   

**A:**  If there is a big fight, the shidü would beat them a little bit. In my time, there wasn't such things happened.   

**Q:**  During your three years term, what kind of things happened?   

**A:**  I had one case in my 3 years. In the first year I was there there was a potter who set fire to the threshing ground when the grain was about to be threshed. We were working there when he did it. Fortunately, we had put thorns around the grain stocks. When the thorn caught fire it was night so we saw at once and put it off. We caught him right then and there. We tied him to a pillar and beat him up a little bit. Then we turned him over to Liu Dzong [Tib. སྣེའུ་རྫོང].   

**Q:**  What was the reason for him doing this?   

**A:**  He was the one who make the pots for the Dalai Lama and when he was made to transport the pots, he should have come earlier, but he came in the afternoon and the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. མི་སེར] A term that can mean serf/bound subject as well as citizen, depending on context. For example, the miser of a lord would connote the bound subjects of that lord, whereas the miser of Tibet would connote citizens of Tibet.">miser</a> had to wait for him to get the pots to transport to the next station. So I told him."it is not good if you do like this because the miser have to wait for you and they have to work on the fields" But still he was kind of sassy. Later, he appealed to <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཞོལ] The walled town beneath the Potala Palace in Lhasa.">Shöl</a> legung.   

**Q:**  To which <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. དཔོན་པོ, མངའ་བདག] 1. A manorial estate holder. 2. Chief of an area.">lord</a> [Tib. དཔོན་པོ] did he belong to?   

**A:**  He was the one who make the pots for the Dalai Lama. So he was showing off this position. Then <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཞོལ་ལས་ཁུངས] The Tibetan government office responsible for law and order in Shöl (tib. ཞོལ), the walled town beneath the Potala, as well as for 18 districts (tib. རྫོང) around Lhasa.

I didn't go at once. We were also a <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. གྲྭ་ཚང] A &quot;college&quot; within a monastery, for example, in Drepung Monastery there were four main tratsang: Gomang, Loseling, Deyang and Ngagpa. These tratsang were property owning corporate entities and included monks who were organized into residential dormitories called Khamtsen.">tratsang</a>, so we didn't have to yield to them. This was the grudge he held and finally he suffered the loss. We told the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཕྱག་སྦུག] A manager (of estates and endowments) of a monastic college or monastic khamtsen.">chabu</a> and the chabu sent a person to Shöl legung.   

**Q:**  Didn't you have to go to <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཞོལ་ལས་ཁུངས] The Tibetan government office responsible for law and order in Shöl (tib. ཞོལ), the walled town beneath the Potala, as well as for 18 districts (tib. རྫོང) around Lhasa. It handled mainly criminal cases including murder.">Shöl legung</a>?   

**A:**  I also eventually had to go there.   

**Q:**  What did they say?   

**Q:**  They asked me what happened.   

**A:**  I said, "the pots were transported from Sanggu [Tib. གསང་ཕུ] to <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. སྡེ་ཡངས] One of the colleges in Drepung Monastery.">Deyang</a> Shiga. And Deyang Shiga had to transport it to Sangda [Tib. གསང་མདའ]. From Sangda it is transported to <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. རམ་མ་སྒང] A ferry site on the Lhasa River south of Lhasa City.">Ramagang</a> [Tib. ར་མ་སྒང]. And from Ramagang to Lhasa. That's how it worked. The potter should have transported the pots early in the morning to Deyang Shiga and our <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. མི་སེར] A term that can mean serf/bound subject as well as citizen, depending on context. For example, the miser of a lord would connote the bound subjects of that lord, whereas the miser of Tibet would connote citizens of Tibet.">miser</a> had to transport it to Sangda, but this potter transported the pots only in the afternoon and our miser had to wait there. The miser have to work for many other taxes and they have to plant the field and they couldn't do it because he didn't come on time. So I couldn't transport the pots". In the end, the potter was kind of lost. He was a miser of Loseling. So he became embarrased and set our threshing ground on fire. So I caught him and whipped him and took him to the Liu Dzong. The Liu <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. རྫོང] A district in the traditional Tibetan governmental structure.

They were responsible for collecting taxes and adjudicating disputes in their district. These dzong were equivalent to counties (ch. 县) in the current Chinese system of administration.">dzong</a> also whipped him and handed him over to Shangdrong Shiga under their custody.   

**Q:**  At that time, do the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. གཞིས་ཀ] A manorial estate.">shiga</a> have the power to beat people with switches?   

**A:**  We had the power, but we didn't do that. As a symbol for having this power, we had a big prayer pole given by the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. སྡེ་བ་གཞུང] The name of the traditional Tibetan government.">dewashung</a> as the title. Not all the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. གཞིས་ཀ] A manorial estate.">shiga</a> had this. If the shiga had this prayer pole then you could settle the cases.   

**Q:**  If you arrest a thief what would you do?   

**A:**  We would not punish him and we would hand him over to the dzong.   

**Q:**  If he is your owen <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. མི་སེར] A term that can mean serf/bound subject as well as citizen, depending on context. For example, the miser of a lord would connote the bound subjects of that lord, whereas the miser of Tibet would connote citizens of Tibet.">miser</a>?   

**A:**  For our own <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. མི་སེར] A term that can mean serf/bound subject as well as citizen, depending on context. For example, the miser of a lord would connote the bound subjects of that lord, whereas the miser of Tibet would connote citizens of Tibet.">miser</a>, we could make the desision.
