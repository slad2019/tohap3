**A:**  I and my teacher's plan was that when I finished <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. བློ་རིགས] The last class/level in the düdra monastic curriculum. This is the end of the phase of memorizing texts.">lurik</span> exam I should go to Lhasa and there my maternal ant's relative is (a <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. ཐང་ཀ] A Tibetan scroll painting.">thanka</span> painter] whose husband Loya [Tib. ལོ་ཡག] was very skilled thanka painter. I would study thanka painting with him. This was before we merged shagtsang. But since I was appointed lurik umdze, that was impossible because I was now in the ketrelpa [Tib. སྐད་གྲལ་པ], the ones who have good voice and had to memorize all the prayers of the <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. གྲྭ་ཚང] A &quot;college&quot; within a monastery, for example, in Drepung Monastery there were four main tratsang: Gomang, Loseling, Deyang and Ngagpa. These tratsang were property owning corporate entities and included monks who were organized into residential dormitories called Khamtsen.">tratsang</span> that was recitd on the assembly, so had no time to study artist. There are not many prayers to learn for <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. སྒོ་མང] One of the large colleges in Drepung Monastery.">Gomang</span>. Gomang's chöjö has, 160 pages. Then there is also Gyenjugnyi [Tib. རྒྱན་འཇུག་གཉིས] which is Ngöntogyen [Tib. མངོན་རྟོགས་རྒྱན] and <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. དབུ་མ] The Madhyamaka text (&quot;the Middle Way&quot;).">Uma</span> Jugpa [Tib. དབུ་མ་འཇུག་པ] and the Dugsher Sengsum [Tib. གདུགས་ཤེས་སེང་གསུམ] and Drölma [Tib. སྒྲོལ་མ]. There are various different tone [Tib.དབྱངས] in the Gomang chöjö. And you have to learn this tone and find a teacher to teach you. Then you have to learn the prayers associated with Uma and Parchin [Tib. ཕར་ཕྱིན]. And you do Parchin's dönsang. After I did Parchin dönsang, I became Pharchin umdze. There is a Parchin linga [Tib. གླིང་ག] in the 5th month for one day. There is another one at <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. ལྔ་མཆོད] The Ganden Ngamjö holiday commemorating the death of Tsongkapa. It falls on the 25th of the 10th Tibetan lunar month.">Ngamjö</span> time for one day and at the day commemorating the Buddha coming back to the earth, Lhabab Düchen [Tib. ལྷ་བབ་དུས་ཆེན] for one day. Then there is Trumtha [Tib. གྲུབ་མཐའ] for three days, Jubshi [Tib. བཅུ་བཞི] for one day. At these times, I acted as pharchin umdze. The umdze himself has to do these, he can't hire someone else to do them. After you have done Pharchin umdze, then you do Parchin Thamcha [Tib. phar phyn dam bca'] If you aren't a pechwa you hire a <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. དགེ་ཤེས] An advanced degree earned by scholar monks.">geshe</span> to do this. Then after you have done Pharchin umdze, you can only go up to tratsang umdze. It is the stepping stone to tratsang umdze. These were all done accordig to the thought of Jayan Shepa who was the owner of the document of the Gomang. In 1950 when the Dalai Lama went to <span class="tooltip" data-text="[ch. 亚东] The Chinese name for the Tibetan town called Tromo that is located on the Sikkim border.">Yadong</span> the Gomang Tratsang umdze was appointed tshochen umdze by Sitsab <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. ཀླུ་ཁང་བ] The family name of a famous aristocratic lay official who was one of the two Sitsab in 1950-52.">Lukhangwa</span> [Tib. ཀླུ་ཁང་བ] of the dewashung. In the winter of that year, he was appointed the Gomang tratsang umdze. Then I did the umdze for 9 years.   

**Q:**  How many ketrelpa were there in the <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. སྒོ་མང] One of the large colleges in Drepung Monastery.">Gomang</span> at that time?   

**A:**  There were about 100 of them.   

**Q:**  How old were you then?   

**A:**  There were two ways of becoming dönsangnga. The other ones were sellect the better ones by the umdze and <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. དགེ་སྐོས] The main disciplinary official in a monastic college (tratsang).">gegö</span> in the <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. ཚོགས] 1. A prayer assembly meeting in monasteries when all the monks come to an assembly hall and chant prayers together. 2. An offering made of tsamba, butter and dry cheese in the shape of a cone.">tsog</span> and put him into the group specially. In the beginninjg, there were about 50-60 but later it was increased. When a sponsors request for tsog and alms in <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. སྒོ་མང] One of the large colleges in Drepung Monastery.">Gomang</span>, they always asked for a donation called Yangchag [Tib.དབྱངས་ཕྱག་ཞལ་འདེབས]. If the umdze is good and when we also have a good endowment, then we sometimes are able to hold the Yangchag for 7 days and give alms to the monks. And we sit in front row, [Tib. གདོང་གྲལ]. At the head of the tshogs' in front row is the <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. སྤྲུལ་སྐུ] An incarnate lama.">trüku</span> of the regents, <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. རྒྱལ་སྤྲུལ] Incarnations who have been regents in previous incarnations.">gyetrü</span> [Tib. རྒྱལ་སྤྲུལ] then the trüku of the <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. དགའ་ལྡན་ཁྲི་པ] The chief abbot of Ganden Monastery. He is considered to hold the throne of Tsongkapa, the founder of the Gelugpa sect.">Ganden Tripa</span>, tritrü, [Tib. ཁྲི་སྤྲུལ] then tsogchen trüku, then the trüku of the <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. གྲྭ་ཚང] A &quot;college&quot; within a monastery, for example, in Drepung Monastery there were four main tratsang: Gomang, Loseling, Deyang and Ngagpa. These tratsang were property owning corporate entities and included monks who were organized into residential dormitories called Khamtsen.">tratsang</span>, khentrü, [Tib. མཁན་སྤྲུལ] then we, the umdze woud sit.   

**Q:**  Next to you were the enchöndze, right?   

**A:**  Yes. This was when we were incumbent. Then the ketrelpa would sit and the monks sit in order of seniority.   

**Q:**  Do the senior most monk [Tib. མཚན་ཐོ་དང་པོ] sit in the front row?   

**A:**  No.   

**Q:**  Who would make the decision whether he is a ketrelpa?   

**A:**  The <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. དགེ་སྐོས] The main disciplinary official in a monastic college (tratsang).">gegö</span> would make the decision and make them sit in the front row.   

**A:**  Yes.   

**A:**  When you become a ketrelpa, do you have the right of <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. ཐོན] In monasteries, a title for monks who have finished their monastic job obligations (tib. ཐོན་ཟིན).">thön</span>, [Tib. ཐོན]?   

**A:**  No. When you finish the umdze then you have the <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. ཐོན] In monasteries, a title for monks who have finished their monastic job obligations (tib. ཐོན་ཟིན).">thön</span> and ketrelpa was the only way to become a umdze.   

**Q:**  Phodrang Depa [Tib. ཕོ་བྲང་སྡེ་པ] Parkhang Depa [Tib. པར་ཁང་སྡེ་པ] Chökhang Depa [Tib. མཆོད་ཁང་སྡེ་པ] these are all appointed by government?   

**A:**  Yes. There are 2 chökhang. One is from east <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. སྒོ་མང] One of the large colleges in Drepung Monastery.">Gomang</span>, the others one is from (west) the Ngagpa [Tib. སྔགས་པ] Tratsang. This is a rule. One Parkhang Depa is Gomang, and the other is <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. བློ་གསལ་གླིང] One of the main colleges in Drepung Monastery.">Loseling</span>; the Phodrang Depa is only from Gomang. Then there is a tsomchen depa [Tib.ཚོམས་ཆེན་སྡེ་པ] and simchung depa [Tib.གཟིམ་ཆུང་སྡེ་པ]. These are from Loseling.   

**Q:**  With the Phodrang Depa, would they select them from the all the <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. ཁང་ཚན] A monastic residential unit in which monks from specific geographic areas lived. These were corporate entities with property and internal officials. Some large khamtsen had smaller subordinate units called mi tshan. Khamtsen were part of tratsang (colleges). For example, Hamdong Khamtsen was part of Gomang College in Drepung Monastery.">khamtsen</span> within <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. སྒོ་མང] One of the large colleges in Drepung Monastery.">Gomang</span>?   

**A:**  It goes by rotation within the <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. གྲྭ་ཚང] A &quot;college&quot; within a monastery, for example, in Drepung Monastery there were four main tratsang: Gomang, Loseling, Deyang and Ngagpa. These tratsang were property owning corporate entities and included monks who were organized into residential dormitories called Khamtsen.">tratsang</span> 's <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. ཁང་ཚན] A monastic residential unit in which monks from specific geographic areas lived. These were corporate entities with property and internal officials. Some large khamtsen had smaller subordinate units called mi tshan. Khamtsen were part of tratsang (colleges). For example, Hamdong Khamtsen was part of Gomang College in Drepung Monastery.">khamtsen</span>. So if the Phodrang Depa has to be changed and if you become a Phodrang Depa, you have to join the khamtsen whose turn it is and work for them like renovating the houses. For example, the Phodrang Depa before the revolt was from Shungba [Tib. གཞུང་པ] Khamtsen. So he was not originally from <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. གཞུང་པ] The name for the students in the Tse labdra school who were recruited by conscription from specified monasteries to be trained to become monk officials.">shungba</span> khamtsen, so it was impossible for him to get this jod because he was the <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. སྤྱི་བསོ] The head managers/stewards of monasteries as a whole, especially the large Gelugpa monasteries like Sera and Drepung.">jiso</span> Lhawang [Tib. ལྷ་དབང], Ling's <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. ཤག་ཚང] 1. The household or family of a monk that consisted of multiple monks. 2. The apartment of a monk household.">shagtsang</span>'s gidru. He applied to become a Shungba Khamtsen's member and for Shungba Khamtsen he did a lot of work like repairing the Shungpa Khantsen jikhang. So Shungba Khamtsen appointed him as their turn for becoming the Phodrang Deba.   

**Q:**  What is the term of the Phodrang Deba.   

**A:**  It was 6 years. Jiso is 10 years. You need a person who is capable to be Phodrang Depa . The candidate from the <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. ཁང་ཚན] A monastic residential unit in which monks from specific geographic areas lived. These were corporate entities with property and internal officials. Some large khamtsen had smaller subordinate units called mi tshan. Khamtsen were part of tratsang (colleges). For example, Hamdong Khamtsen was part of Gomang College in Drepung Monastery.">khamtsen</span> has to have done a lot of work for the khamtsen such as repairing buildings etc. So when a khamtsen's turn comes, if they don't have a good person already, they don't lose their turn. They put in someone like the above case. That is seen to be okay since it benefits the khamtsen.   

**Q:**  When you want to join the <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. ཁང་ཚན] A monastic residential unit in which monks from specific geographic areas lived. These were corporate entities with property and internal officials. Some large khamtsen had smaller subordinate units called mi tshan. Khamtsen were part of tratsang (colleges). For example, Hamdong Khamtsen was part of Gomang College in Drepung Monastery.">khamtsen</span> to become a Phodrang Depa, first he had to give a <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. ཚོམ་ཇ] The name of the khamtsen&#x27;s prayer assembly meetings at which tea was served.">tsomja</span>, right?   

**A:**  Yes. And then he also renovated the house of the khamtsen.   

**Q:**  This is like a bribe?   

**A:**  No its more like an endowment,jog, [Tib. འཇོགས]. When such a person wanting to be Phodrang Depa thinks of joining <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. གཞུང་པ] The name for the students in the Tse labdra school who were recruited by conscription from specified monasteries to be trained to become monk officials.">shungba</span>, first he has a discussion with officials. If I want to join your <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. ཁང་ཚན] A monastic residential unit in which monks from specific geographic areas lived. These were corporate entities with property and internal officials. Some large khamtsen had smaller subordinate units called mi tshan. Khamtsen were part of tratsang (colleges). For example, Hamdong Khamtsen was part of Gomang College in Drepung Monastery.">khamtsen</span> to get Phodrang Depa . I'll do this and this for our khamtsen. So in the above case he repaired the jikhang well and probably did other things as well.   

**Q:**  How does the shengo appointment work?   

**A:**  In the early times, there used to be 7 <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. གྲྭ་ཚང] A &quot;college&quot; within a monastery, for example, in Drepung Monastery there were four main tratsang: Gomang, Loseling, Deyang and Ngagpa. These tratsang were property owning corporate entities and included monks who were organized into residential dormitories called Khamtsen.">tratsang</span> in Drepung; upon the 4 present tratsang, there were Düwa [Tib. འདུལ་བ], Shagor [Tib. ཤག་སྒོར] and Gyepa, [Tib. རྒྱས་པ] and it rotates between the different tratsang putting up two names every year. <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. སྒོ་མང] One of the large colleges in Drepung Monastery.">Gomang</span> gets a shengo for two years in a row, then has a one year rest. <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. བློ་གསལ་གླིང] One of the main colleges in Drepung Monastery.">Loseling</span> gets 3 years in a row then one year off. Loseling has under its 3 turns because it has two of the vacant tratsang; gyepa and Shagor. Gomang has under its control 1 of the vacant tratsang Düwa Tratsang. Gamang gets 20 shengo. Then Ngagpa and <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. སྡེ་ཡངས] One of the colleges in Drepung Monastery.">Deyang</span> each get one.   

**Q:**  How do they do within the <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. སྒོ་མང] One of the large colleges in Drepung Monastery.">Gomang</span>?   

**A:**  Within <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. སྒོ་མང] One of the large colleges in Drepung Monastery.">Gomang</span>, the nominee comes from <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. བོད་པ་གཞུང] The name of a mitsen (residence hall) in both Loseling and Gomang Colleges in Drepung monastery. It was for monks from Central Tibetan, i.e., for Böpa [tib. བོད་པ]).">Böbashung</span> <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. མི་ཚན] A sub-unit of a khamtsen.">mitsen</span>. So it does for two years. Then after a year gap, the shengo from Gomang comes from Düwa--this comes from Gadong mitsen. Gadong mitsen's partner would be <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. བློ་གསལ་གླིང] One of the main colleges in Drepung Monastery.">Loseling</span>. Gomang Böbashung's would be Loseling <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. སྡེ་ཡངས] One of the colleges in Drepung Monastery.">Deyang</span>'s partner would be Gyepa (Loseling) and would be regarded as a harsh, [Tib. རྩུབ་པ] shengo. Gadong Mitsen's partner would be Ngagpa Trstang or sometimes it happens that: Böbashung's partner also would be Ngagba at one rotation. And the Ngagpa's partner also would be Böbashung. But Gyeba and Deyang are always partners. For EXAMPLE: Year 1. Gomang böbashung + Losleing böbashung Year 2. Gomang böbashung + Loseling Gomang böbashung. Year 3. Deyang + Loseling Gyepa. Year 4. Gadong Mitsen + Ngagpa.   

**Q:**  Shagor is missing.   

**Q:**  <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. བློ་གསལ་གླིང] One of the main colleges in Drepung Monastery.">Loseling</span> could have three shengo cadidates; the <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. གྲྭ་ཚང] A &quot;college&quot; within a monastery, for example, in Drepung Monastery there were four main tratsang: Gomang, Loseling, Deyang and Ngagpa. These tratsang were property owning corporate entities and included monks who were organized into residential dormitories called Khamtsen.">tratsang</span> abbot, Shagor abbot and Gyepa abbot.   

**Q:**  Who was the parner of Shagor?   

**A:**  Shagor belonged to <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. བློ་གསལ་གླིང] One of the main colleges in Drepung Monastery.">Loseling</span> There turn comes from Nyaling Tsosum [Tib. ཉ་གླིང་མཚོ་གསུམ]; [Tib. མྱང་མགོ།གླིང།མཚོ་སྨད] These are <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. ཁང་ཚན] A monastic residential unit in which monks from specific geographic areas lived. These were corporate entities with property and internal officials. Some large khamtsen had smaller subordinate units called mi tshan. Khamtsen were part of tratsang (colleges). For example, Hamdong Khamtsen was part of Gomang College in Drepung Monastery.">khamtsen</span> from Loseling.   

**Q:**  Who is the partner of the Nyaling Tsosum?   

**A:**  It is <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. སྒོ་མང] One of the large colleges in Drepung Monastery.">Gomang</span> Böbashung.   

**Q:**  So <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. སྒོ་མང] One of the large colleges in Drepung Monastery.">Gomang</span> Böbashung does the shengo for two years, right?   

**A:**  Yes and <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. བློ་གསལ་གླིང] One of the main colleges in Drepung Monastery.">Loseling</span> would do three years. And Ngagpa does for one year and <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. སྡེ་ཡངས] One of the colleges in Drepung Monastery.">Deyang</span> does for ome year.   

**Q:**  Where does the nominee from Gyepa come from?   

**A:**  In <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. བློ་གསལ་གླིང] One of the main colleges in Drepung Monastery.">Loseling</span> probably it comes from böbashung.   

**Q:**  The candidates of <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. སྒོ་མང] One of the large colleges in Drepung Monastery.">Gomang</span> itself comes from böbashung. Gandong Mitsen is belobed to Düwa, right?   

**A:**  Yes when they count 7 tratsang. When put forward the cadidates of the shengo, an abbot would come who was called election abbot [Tib. འོས་བསྡུ་མཁན་པོ]. And <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. སྡེ་ཡངས] One of the colleges in Drepung Monastery.">Deyang</span> and the Gyepa abbots go as partners. If it is two böbashung, the abbots of the <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. བློ་གསལ་གླིང] One of the main colleges in Drepung Monastery.">Loseling</span> and <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. སྒོ་མང] One of the large colleges in Drepung Monastery.">Gomang</span> goes as partners.   

**Q:**  Would the two abbots discuss and ask for the permission from the government?   

**A:**  In general,the laji are the ones who actually present them to the government. The election abbot is the one who actually is the key one in making the decision and goes to the <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. ཡིག་ཚང] The highest office dealing with monastic and religious affairs in the traditional Tibetan government. It is often called the Ecclesiastic Office. It was headed by 4 fourth rank monk officials called Trunyichemmo. The senior Trunyichemmo was called Ta Lama.">Yigtsang</span> to inform them of the candidates and the laji actually bring backs the nominees when they laji meeitng was in session and the laji would show the seal of confirmation. Before the 2 abbot comes to the laji, 2 thapyog in white dress and <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. ཞྭ་མོ; ch. 戴帽] 1. A regular hat, cap. 2. A common political slang term (label) used for people who were classified as class enemies or reactionaries. It was used politically as, &quot;They put the hat on him,&quot; or &quot;They never took his hat off.&quot;">hat</span> "arsha [Tib. ཨ་ཞྭ] would stay there. And they send the <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. ཐབ་གཡོག] Monks or laymen who work as servants/manual laborers in kitchens (normally monastic kitchens).">thabyog</span> to deliver the verbal message as to who is the senior shengo and the junior shengo. That day, the appointment letter, [Tib. འོས་རྒྱ] of the the senior shengo would be given to the ex-senior shengo and the appointment of the juinor shengo would be given to the ex-junior shego. Then the 2 ex-shengo would give the new ones khata. Then the ex-shengos would put their appointment letter on a plate with wheat in it. The new ex-senior gives the appointment letter to the new senior and ex-junior gives appointment letter to the new junior. And they would beat the gong on the inauguration day, [Tib. ཁྲི་འདོན].
