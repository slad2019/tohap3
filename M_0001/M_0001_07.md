**Q:**  If the Hamdong [Tib. ཧར་གདོང] Khamtsen Gegen doesn't know writing and is like idiotic and incapable, would he have to be <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. ཁང་ཚན་དགེ་རྒན] The head official of a khamtsen.">khamtsen gegen</span>?   

**A:**  <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. ཧར་གདོང་ཁང་ཚན] The name of a residential unit (khamtsen) found in both Drepung and Sera Monasteries.">Hamdong Khamtsen</span> Gegen is done by turn, not by capabilities. But if the person whose turn come is handicapped, then he doesn't have to do it. Otherwise, even he is a mute [Tib. ཁ་ལྐུགས་པ] he have to go.   

**A:**  If some one didn't want to be a <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. ཁང་ཚན་དགེ་རྒན] The head official of a khamtsen.">khamtsen gegen</span>, was there any rule of paying money or giving <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. གཏོང་སྒོ] A monastic obligation to provide the food and other necessary items served at a monastic prayer assembly meeting or some other rite; this was often a required obligation for monastic officials at the end of their term of office.">tonggo</span> to avoid it?   

**A:**  There is no way to pay to avoid this.   

**Q:**  After finishing <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. ཁང་ཚན་དགེ་རྒན] The head official of a khamtsen.">khamtsen gegen</span>, you enter <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. ཚོགས་འདུ] 1. The general name for the various types of Tibetan government assemblies. 2. Any assembly, e.g., the assembly (meeting) of monks in a college.">tsondu</span>, right?   

**A:**  Yes.   

**Q:**  Were the monastic officials, <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. ལས་སྣེ] The general name for all monastic officials.">lene</span> [Tib. ལས་སྣེ] like the steward, <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. གཉེར་ཚང] 1. Storehouse. 2. Steward, person in charge of a storehouse. 3. A monastic official in charge of storerooms.">nyertsang</span> [Tib. གཉེར་ཚང], <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. ཕྱག་སྦུག] A manager (of estates and endowments) of a monastic college or monastic khamtsen.">chabu</span>, the grain steward, <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. འབྲུ་གཉེར] A steward (nyerpa) in charge of grain.">drunyer</span> [Tib. འབྲུ་གཉེར] and <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. ཇ་མ] The monk(s) in charge of a monastery&#x27;s kitchen.">jama</span> appointed by the <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. ཚོགས་འདུ] 1.

**A:**  The <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. ཚོགས་འདུ] 1. The general name for the various types of Tibetan government assemblies. 2. Any assembly, e.g., the assembly (meeting) of monks in a college.">tsondu</span> would appoint them.   

**Q:**  What other <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. ལས་སྣེ] The general name for all monastic officials.">lene</span> were there?   

**A:**  There was chandzö.   

**Q:**  In the <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. ཁང་ཚན] A monastic residential unit in which monks from specific geographic areas lived. These were corporate entities with property and internal officials. Some large khamtsen had smaller subordinate units called mi tshan. Khamtsen were part of tratsang (colleges). For example, Hamdong Khamtsen was part of Gomang College in Drepung Monastery.">khamtsen</span> do you call them <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. ཕྱག་མཛོད] A senior manager/treasurer of an aristocratic or monastic estate, or the senior manager/treasurer of an aristocratic family or a monastic unit. Generally chandzö handled both internal and external issues and were considered higher in power and status than nyerpa (stewards), who typically only handled the storerooms.">chandzö</span> or <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. གཉེར་པ] A steward or manager. In some monasteries, the nyerpa was in charge of storerooms under the authority of a higher manager called a chandzö.">nyerpa</span>?   

**Q:**  There was the <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. ཕྱག་མཛོད] A senior manager/treasurer of an aristocratic or monastic estate, or the senior manager/treasurer of an aristocratic family or a monastic unit. Generally chandzö handled both internal and external issues and were considered higher in power and status than nyerpa (stewards), who typically only handled the storerooms.">chandzö</span> who is appointed by turn and there were others like genyen [Tib. དགེ་བསྙེན] who were appointed by their khamtsen. The <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. ཁང་ཚན་དགེ་རྒན] The head official of a khamtsen.">khamtsen gegen</span> was obliged to do some of the <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. ལས་སྣེ] The general name for all monastic officials.">lene</span> like <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. ནང་ཟན] A type of serf/bound peasant who lived in the house of his or her lord and worked as a servant without pay.">nangsen</span> and the Nyungjai Jama [Tib. ཉུང་ཇའི་ཇ་མ].   

**Q:**  Khamtsen <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. དགེ་རྒན] 1. Teacher in a school. 2. In monastic settings it also refers to an adult monk who acted as a guardian to a younger monk. In such cases, the younger monk typically lived in the gegen&#x27;s apartment (shag). In monasteries, however, it could also mean a real teacher, or the monk who served as the guarantor for a new monk.">gegen</span> have to hire the people, right?   

**A:**  Yes.   

**Q:**  What other positions were there that were done by turn other than the <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. ཕྱག་མཛོད] A senior manager/treasurer of an aristocratic or monastic estate, or the senior manager/treasurer of an aristocratic family or a monastic unit. Generally chandzö handled both internal and external issues and were considered higher in power and status than nyerpa (stewards), who typically only handled the storerooms.">chandzö</span>?   

**A:**  There was no other that goes by turn.   

**Q:**  Who is selected by turns? How is it done?   

**A:**  These two are by turns for the 9 <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. མི་ཚན] A sub-unit of a khamtsen.">mitsen</span> [Tib. མི་ཚན].   

**Q:**  If you are not in a <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. མི་ཚན] A sub-unit of a khamtsen.">mitsen</span>, then you don't have to do <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. ཁང་ཚན་དགེ་རྒན] The head official of a khamtsen.">khamtsen gegen</span>, right?   

**Q:**  Yes. The ones who become the <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. ཁང་ཚན་དགེ་རྒན] The head official of a khamtsen.">khamtsen gegen</span> definitely have their mitsen. So there is a direct relationship between the khamtsen gegen and 9 mitsen. I think the khamtsen gegen appointment custom is like the feudal system [i.e. not by qualifications but by turns between mitsen].   

**Q:**  What you said about the <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. ཚོགས་འདུ] 1. The general name for the various types of Tibetan government assemblies. 2. Any assembly, e.g., the assembly (meeting) of monks in a college.">tsondu</span> is the <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. ཁང་ཚན] A monastic residential unit in which monks from specific geographic areas lived. These were corporate entities with property and internal officials. Some large khamtsen had smaller subordinate units called mi tshan. Khamtsen were part of tratsang (colleges). For example, Hamdong Khamtsen was part of Gomang College in Drepung Monastery.">khamtsen</span> tsondu, right?   

**A:**  Yes.   

**Q:**  First they become the <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. ཁང་ཚན་དགེ་རྒན] The head official of a khamtsen.">khamtsen gegen</span> and then they become <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. ཕྱག་མཛོད] A senior manager/treasurer of an aristocratic or monastic estate, or the senior manager/treasurer of an aristocratic family or a monastic unit. Generally chandzö handled both internal and external issues and were considered higher in power and status than nyerpa (stewards), who typically only handled the storerooms.">chandzö</span>, right?   

**A:**  The monks who have done <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. ཁང་ཚན་དགེ་རྒན] The head official of a khamtsen.">khamtsen gegen</span> can attend the meeting. There were many monks who have done the <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. ཁང་ཚན] A monastic residential unit in which monks from specific geographic areas lived. These were corporate entities with property and internal officials. Some large khamtsen had smaller subordinate units called mi tshan. Khamtsen were part of tratsang (colleges).

Generally chandzö handled both internal and external issues and were considered higher in power and status than nyerpa (stewards), who typically only handled the storerooms.">chandzö</span>. I heard those people were not allowed to talk in the meeting before they become chandzö. I am not sure whether this is true. Usually, the chandzö's turn comes only 3-4 years after they having finished the khamtsen gegen.   

**Q:**  Did <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. ཧར་གདོང་ཁང་ཚན] The name of a residential unit (khamtsen) found in both Drepung and Sera Monasteries.">Hamdong Khamtsen</span> have <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. ཆོས་གཤིས] A &quot;religious&quot; estate held by a monastery or lama.">chöshi</span>?   

**A:**  Yes.   

**Q:**  This is the job of the <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. ཕྱག་མཛོད] A senior manager/treasurer of an aristocratic or monastic estate, or the senior manager/treasurer of an aristocratic family or a monastic unit. Generally chandzö handled both internal and external issues and were considered higher in power and status than nyerpa (stewards), who typically only handled the storerooms.">chandzö</span>, right?

These tratsang were property owning corporate entities and included monks who were organized into residential dormitories called Khamtsen.">tratsang</span> gegö, the umdze and those belonged to the tsondu can attend the tsondu. Others are not allowed to attend the meeting. This was because these <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. ཁང་ཚན་དགེ་རྒན] The head official of a khamtsen.">khamtsen gegen</span> came from 9 khamtsen.   

**Q:**  The ones who have position in the <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. གྲྭ་ཚང] A &quot;college&quot; within a monastery, for example, in Drepung Monastery there were four main tratsang: Gomang, Loseling, Deyang and Ngagpa.

**Q:**  Is Jiso Takhare from central Tibet?   

**A:**  He is from the north, Hor [Tib. ཧོར].   

**Q:**  He had already become <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. ཁང་ཚན་དགེ་རྒན] The head official of a khamtsen.">khamtsen gegen</span>, right?   

**A:**  Yes and he became the member of the Hamdong <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. ཚོགས་འདུ] 1. The general name for the various types of Tibetan government assemblies. 2. Any assembly, e.g., the assembly (meeting) of monks in a college.">tsondu</span> and since he was the <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. སྤྱི་བསོ] The head managers/stewards of monasteries as a whole, especially the large Gelugpa monasteries like Sera and Drepung.">jiso</span> he came to the tsondu.

In monastic settings it also refers to an adult monk who acted as a guardian to a younger monk. In such cases, the younger monk typically lived in the gegen&#x27;s apartment (shag). In monasteries, however, it could also mean a real teacher, or the monk who served as the guarantor for a new monk.">gegen</span>'s names on a piece of paper and rolled up like a cigarette and the tragyün would pick up one and that becomes his gegen and they will notice the gegen that this is your pupil.   

**Q:**  This is like getting a <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. དགེ་རྒན] 1. Teacher in a school. 2. In monastic settings it also refers to an adult monk who acted as a guardian to a younger monk. In such cases, the younger monk typically lived in the gegen&#x27;s apartment (shag). In monasteries, however, it could also mean a real teacher, or the monk who served as the guarantor for a new monk.">gegen</span> through drawing kind of a lottery, right?

The butter fat that coagulates on the top of butter-tea when the tea is left to sit for some time.

The senior monks are usually served tea with a lot of shag.">shag</span>, there was a member of the Hor Mitsen Tsondu. He was very poor and his mother was like a beggar and died near the clay statue house [Tib. ཚ་ཁང] in Gyanbumgang [Tib. རྗེ་འབུམ་སྒང]. And now he is in the Lhasa People's Hospital and he would come to see me. Two of us were the only ones survived among 5 members of our shag.

Generally, donggos had associated endowments that monks used by turns to fund a donggo.
