The nyerpa was very hard.   

**Q:**  Did the <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. གྲྭ་རྒྱུན] Monks who came to Drepung, Ganden and Sera from far distances such as Kham and Amdo.">tragyün</span> have to serve admission tea, Sarja?

Teacher in a school. 2. In monastic settings it also refers to an adult monk who acted as a guardian to a younger monk. In such cases, the younger monk typically lived in the gegen&#x27;s apartment (shag).

**A:**  When the <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. གྲྭ་རྒྱུན] Monks who came to Drepung, Ganden and Sera from far distances such as Kham and Amdo.">tragyün</span> would come, if they had relatives or if there were some monks who came from the same village, then they would make them become a monk. If you didn't have any one in the <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. མི་ཚན] A sub-unit of a khamtsen.">mitsen</span> who knew you, but if you belonged to that mitsen, all the members of the meeting would write their names on a piece of paper and roll it into a cigarette shape and put them in a cardboard box. They would hand it over to the <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. གཉེར་པ] A steward or manager. In some monasteries, the nyerpa was in charge of storerooms under the authority of a higher manager called a chandzö.">nyerpa</span> helper, nyeryog, [Tib. གཉེར་གཡོག] and leave it in the box in the assembly hall.

In such cases, the younger monk typically lived in the gegen&#x27;s apartment (shag).

The <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. གཉེར་པ] A steward or manager.

In my <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. 1. ཤག, 2. ཞག] 1. The apartment/room of a monk. 2. The butter fat that coagulates on the top of butter-tea when the tea is left to sit for some time. If the tea had been made with a lot of butter, this layer could be thick enough to scoop off and save to later sell or eat separately. The senior monks are usually served tea with a lot of shag.">shag</span>, my gegen got one tragyün from lottery system because he was from the north. He is now in the People's Hospital.   

**Q:**  What did you call your <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. དགེ་རྒན] 1. Teacher in a school. 2. In monastic settings it also refers to an adult monk who acted as a guardian to a younger monk. In such cases, the younger monk typically lived in the gegen&#x27;s apartment (shag). In monasteries, however, it could also mean a real teacher, or the monk who served as the guarantor for a new monk.">gegen</span>?   

**A:**  I called him the monastic seat <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. དགེ་རྒན] 1. Teacher in a school. 2. In monastic settings it also refers to an adult monk who acted as a guardian to a younger monk. In such cases, the younger monk typically lived in the gegen&#x27;s apartment (shag).

In monastic settings it also refers to an adult monk who acted as a guardian to a younger monk. In such cases, the younger monk typically lived in the gegen&#x27;s apartment (shag). In monasteries, however, it could also mean a real teacher, or the monk who served as the guarantor for a new monk.">gegen</span> well, then the gegen may keep him as his pupil forever. If the pupil didn't behave well, then the gegen would find a guarantor, [Tib. ཁས་འཁྱག] gegen for him and the pupil would stay separately. In the future, if the pupil got into trouble and need to approach the monastic officials, the gegen himself didn't need to take the responsibility and the guarantor gegen had to bear the responsibility.   

**Q:**  Your <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. དགེ་རྒན] 1. Teacher in a school. 2. In monastic settings it also refers to an adult monk who acted as a guardian to a younger monk. In such cases, the younger monk typically lived in the gegen&#x27;s apartment (shag).

In monasteries, however, it could also mean a real teacher, or the monk who served as the guarantor for a new monk.">gegen</span>?   

**A:**  Actually, when you got a pupil from the lottery, you have to keep him with you. When the pupil got older and if he was able to study <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. མཚན་ཉིད] Buddhist dialectics. This is taught after the six-year curriculum called düdra.">tsenyi</span>, then he didn't need to do the <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. གཉེར་པ] A steward or manager. In some monasteries, the nyerpa was in charge of storerooms under the authority of a higher manager called a chandzö.">nyerpa</span> of Hor Mitsen. If he was not able to study tsenyi, then he had to do the nyerpa. If you did the nyerpa, there was a little capital like 100-200 dotse. From that money he had to give the <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. གཏོང་སྒོ] A monastic obligation to provide the food and other necessary items served at a monastic prayer assembly meeting or some other rite; this was often a required obligation for monastic officials at the end of their term of office.">tonggo</span> for 4 days Nyerpa Düsang.

In monasteries, however, it could also mean a real teacher, or the monk who served as the guarantor for a new monk.">gegen</span> to keep his pupil and give him his livelihood?   

**A:**  There was a system like that. Some of the <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. དགེ་རྒན] 1. Teacher in a school. 2. In monastic settings it also refers to an adult monk who acted as a guardian to a younger monk. In such cases, the younger monk typically lived in the gegen&#x27;s apartment (shag). In monasteries, however, it could also mean a real teacher, or the monk who served as the guarantor for a new monk.">gegen</span>s would keep the pupil for 2-3 years and after that the gegen would put the pupil separately.

If he would keep the pupil and if the gegen would treat him well, then the pupil would work for all of his shöndre.   

**Q:**  Some other <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. གྲྭ་རྒྱུན] Monks who came to Drepung, Ganden and Sera from far distances such as Kham and Amdo.">tragyün</span> who were not from Hor Mitsen and they came, but they didn't know other people. So they used many ways to find the <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. དགེ་རྒན] 1. Teacher in a school. 2. In monastic settings it also refers to an adult monk who acted as a guardian to a younger monk. In such cases, the younger monk typically lived in the gegen&#x27;s apartment (shag). In monasteries, however, it could also mean a real teacher, or the monk who served as the guarantor for a new monk.">gegen</span> like selecting bootstraps. Most of the tragyün would say, "I have a gegen, but that was just a gegen in name and I didn't stay with the gegen and I stayed separately and they were not sharing livelihood." Was there anything like this in the Hor <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. མི་ཚན] A sub-unit of a khamtsen.">mitsen</span>?   

**A:**  Some of them were like that in the Hor Mitsen. I think this was like a karmic relation from the previous life between the <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. དགེ་རྒན] 1. Teacher in a school. 2. In monastic settings it also refers to an adult monk who acted as a guardian to a younger monk. In such cases, the younger monk typically lived in the gegen&#x27;s apartment (shag). In monasteries, however, it could also mean a real teacher, or the monk who served as the guarantor for a new monk.">gegen</span> and pupil. Some of them would keep their pupil forever and some of them would just teach the things and set him off in separate apartment just like a guarantor gegen. But according to the rules if you get a pupil from lottery you had to keep him.   

**Q:**  If a <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. དགེ་རྒན] 1. Teacher in a school. 2. In monastic settings it also refers to an adult monk who acted as a guardian to a younger monk. In such cases, the younger monk typically lived in the gegen&#x27;s apartment (shag). In monasteries, however, it could also mean a real teacher, or the monk who served as the guarantor for a new monk.">gegen</span> got a pupil from the lottery, but the gegen didn't want to keep him. What was the shortest time the gegen would keep him? Would they keep him just for 3-4 days and leave him separately?   

**A:**  The shortest time would be that the <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. དགེ་རྒན] 1. Teacher in a school. 2. In monastic settings it also refers to an adult monk who acted as a guardian to a younger monk. In such cases, the younger monk typically lived in the gegen&#x27;s apartment (shag).

If the tea had been made with a lot of butter, this layer could be thick enough to scoop off and save to later sell or eat separately. The senior monks are usually served tea with a lot of shag.">shag</span> and leave him there and during few days, the gegen would just see how he was doing and then leave him there.   

**Q:**  What if the pupil didn't have <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. རྩམ་པ] The traditional Tibetan staple food that consists of grain that is roasted (popped), usually in heated sand, and then ground into a flour.">tsamba</span>, did the <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. དགེ་རྒན] 1. Teacher in a school. 2. In monastic settings it also refers to an adult monk who acted as a guardian to a younger monk. In such cases, the younger monk typically lived in the gegen&#x27;s apartment (shag). In monasteries, however, it could also mean a real teacher, or the monk who served as the guarantor for a new monk.">gegen</span> have to give him tsamba?   

**A:**  He had to find his own way to find tsamba. There were not many situation like this in the Hor Mitsen. The <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. མི་ཚན] A sub-unit of a khamtsen.">mitsen</span> was very upright. Few <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. དགེ་རྒན] 1. Teacher in a school. 2. In monastic settings it also refers to an adult monk who acted as a guardian to a younger monk. In such cases, the younger monk typically lived in the gegen&#x27;s apartment (shag). In monasteries, however, it could also mean a real teacher, or the monk who served as the guarantor for a new monk.">gegen</span> would leave the pupil separate, but it was a very few. Among the 9 mitsen, Hor Mitsen was the best in Hamdong. We had the best <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. དཔེ་ཆ་བ] A monk studying the monastic philosophical curriculum. A scholar monk.">pechawa</span> and the monks called dönsang, [Tib. འདོན་བཟང] who were skilled in chanting prayers with long tones [Tib. འདོན་རྟ་དབྱང] on the assembly like the good dönsang in the tratsang. In the mitsen, the monks were good in <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. མཚན་ཉིད] Buddhist dialectics. This is taught after the six-year curriculum called düdra.">tsenyi</span> because the monks who study tsenyi were treated as special and they didn't need to be the nyerpa. Hor Mitsen belonged to <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. སྟག་ལུང་བྲག] The regent of Tibet who replaced Reting in 1941 and served until 1950 when the 14th Dalai Lama assumed power.">Talungdra</span> and at the time of <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. སྟག་བྲག] The regent of Tibet who replaced Reting in 1941 and served until 1950 when the 14th Dalai Lama assumed power.">Taktra</span> Regency, he built one more story on the mitsen's house. Later, they destroyed it. These days, some people were getting donations in this year and they were trying to build the assembly hall [Tib. ཚོམ].   

**Q:**  When you got the pupil from the lottery system, did the parents help you by giving food?   

**A:**  The most of the lottery pupils didn't have parents to come to see them.   

**Q:**  You mean to say for the <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. གྲྭ་རྒྱུན] Monks who came to Drepung, Ganden and Sera from far distances such as Kham and Amdo.">tragyün</span>?   

**A:**  Among the <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. གྲྭ་རྒྱུན] Monks who came to Drepung, Ganden and Sera from far distances such as Kham and Amdo.">tragyün</span>, some of them have relatives and their condition was quite good. The lottery [Tib. ཤོག་རྒྱན] pupils don't have any one like relatives and they were like beggars.   

**Q:**  What dose it mean by Shogyen [Tib. ཤོག་རྒྱན]?   

**A:**  Shokgyen means lottery. Now my pupil is working in the People's Hospital. He came to see me. When he was my pupil, his mother was begging in Gyanbumgang [Tib. རྗེ་འབུམ་སྒང] in Lhasa.   

**Q:**  Your pupil was from the nomads?   

**A:**  Yes, he came to our <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. 1. ཤག, 2. ཞག] 1. The apartment/room of a monk. 2. The butter fat that coagulates on the top of butter-tea when the tea is left to sit for some time. If the tea had been made with a lot of butter, this layer could be thick enough to scoop off and save to later sell or eat separately. The senior monks are usually served tea with a lot of shag.">shag</span> as a lottery pupil and we kept him until the revolt took place. Since the revolt began he lived separated. Therefore, he came to see me and he would bring rice and flour for me and I gave him tsamba. He told me, "he was grateful to me." There were not that many lottery pupils. The lottery pupils were beggars.   

**Q:**  The monks who come from Damshung, [Tib. འདམ་གཞུང] belonged [Tib. ཐོབ་ཁུང] to Hor Mitsen. Were there any misten for the <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. བོད་པ] 1.
