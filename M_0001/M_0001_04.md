**A:**  With regard to the use of the 70,000 <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ད་ཡང; ch. 大洋] A Chinese silver dollar that had the image of Yuan Shikai on its face. It was used by the Chinese government in Tibet in the 1950s because Tibetans did not accept Chinese paper currency.">dayang</a> from the sale of wood to the Chinese, because the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཕྱག་སྦུག] A manager (of estates and endowments) of a monastic college or monastic khamtsen.">chabu</a> blocked my suggestion to give this to the monks, I specially decided that a group of 8 should oversee this trust [i.e. not just chabu]. I didn't have any hope of becoming famous. I was interested only in helping the livelihood of the monks. And I have no regrets over speaking on behalf of the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. དཔེ་ཆ་བ] A monk studying the monastic philosophical curriculum. A scholar monk.">pechawa</a> and being expelled from the monastery. Mainly, it is all the karmic result of my past lives. I tried to do good but got bad results for myself, I think it must be the result of previous lives.   

**Q:**  If a monk violates a religious rule and lost his celibacy and did something against the rule, it would be settled by the abbot and the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. དགེ་སྐོས] The main disciplinary official in a monastic college (tratsang).">gegö</a>, right?   

**A:**  Yes, and the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. དགེ་སྐོས] The main disciplinary official in a monastic college (tratsang).">gegö</a> has tremendous power. He holds the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. གྲྭ་ཚང] A &quot;college&quot; within a monastery, for example, in Drepung Monastery there were four main tratsang: Gomang, Loseling, Deyang and Ngagpa. These tratsang were property owning corporate entities and included monks who were organized into residential dormitories called Khamtsen.">tratsang</a> charter [Tib. བཅའ་ཡིག]. If the gegö is a strong willed person, he not only can expel regular monks, he can expel even the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཕྱག་སྦུག] A manager (of estates and endowments) of a monastic college or monastic khamtsen.">chabu</a> if the chabu did something wrong. The power to settle issues that involve the monastery as a whole rests on the shengo. If the shengo can't settle an issue, then the laji is convened. In the laji there are abbots, ex-abbots, shengo, <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཚོགས་ཆེན] The main assembly hall of a monastery. The assembly hall for the monastery as a whole.">tshogchen</a> umdze, <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཕོ་བྲང་སྡེ་པ] The monastic official in charge of the Ganden Photrang building in Drepung monastery.">phodrang depa</a> [Tib. ཕོ་བྲང་སྡེ་པ] these were the high laji and under that that there were Parkhangdepa [Tib. པར་ཁང་སྡེ་པ] Chökhangdepa [Tib. མཆོད་ཁང་སྡེ་པ] and the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཁང་ཚན] A monastic residential unit in which monks from specific geographic areas lived. These were corporate entities with property and internal officials. Some large khamtsen had smaller subordinate units called mi tshan. Khamtsen were part of tratsang (colleges). For example, Hamdong Khamtsen was part of Gomang College in Drepung Monastery.">khamtsen</a> gegan of Hamdong [Tib. ཧར་གདོང] and Samlo [Tib. བསམ་ལྷོ]. These were middle laji. And the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. སྤྱི་བསོ] The head managers/stewards of monasteries as a whole, especially the large Gelugpa monasteries like Sera and Drepung.">jiso</a> is also in the high laji. The head of the laji is the Senior Abbot, Khenpo tripa [Tib. མཁན་པོ་ཁྲི་པ] who is the highest senior among all the ex-abbots in Drepung. During my time as umdze, the Khenpo tripa was an ex-abbot Gyeba Khenpo Jungne La [Tib. རྒྱས་པ་མཁན་པོ་འབྱུང་གནས་ལགས]. The middle <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. བླ་སྤྱི] The highest administrative council in large monasteries, like Drepung. It consisted of the Abbots, the Tshogchen Umdze, the Shengo and the Jiso. In Drepung it also included ex-abbots.">Laji</a> "dringa" [Tib. འབྲིང་བ] contains, in addition the parkang depa, chökhang deba and two khamtsen gegan of Hamdo and Samlo.   

**Q:**  Can you tell us how the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. སྒོ་མང] One of the large colleges in Drepung Monastery.">Gomang</a> Tratsang eliminated the eating commune, <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ལྟོ་ཚང] 1. The club of the Dobdos. 2. A group of people eating together.">tobtsang</a> [Tib. ལྟོབ་ཚང] of <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ལྡབ་ལྡོབ] A mildly deviant type of fighting or &quot;punk&quot; monk who engaged in fighting and other unusual behaviors for monks in traditional Tibet&#x27;s large monasteries.">dobdo</a>? Who was the person holding the power?   

**A:**  The main decision about this was made by the abbots and the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. དགེ་སྐོས] The main disciplinary official in a monastic college (tratsang).">gegö</a>. The <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. སྒོ་མང] One of the large colleges in Drepung Monastery.">Gomang</a> abbot eliminated the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ལྡབ་ལྡོབ] A mildly deviant type of fighting or &quot;punk&quot; monk who engaged in fighting and other unusual behaviors for monks in traditional Tibet&#x27;s large monasteries.">dobdo</a> <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ལྟོ་ཚང] 1. The club of the Dobdos. 2. A group of people eating together.">tobtsang</a> and made them to start studying <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. དཔེ་ཆ] Religious books/texts, scriptures.">pecha</a>. In the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. གྲྭ་ཚང] A &quot;college&quot; within a monastery, for example, in Drepung Monastery there were four main tratsang: Gomang, Loseling, Deyang and Ngagpa. These tratsang were property owning corporate entities and included monks who were organized into residential dormitories called Khamtsen.">tratsang</a>, the abbot mainly deals with studying pecha and the gegö would support it, but the gegö would get changed in 6 months. In winter the gegö is done by the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. དགེ་ཤེས] An advanced degree earned by scholar monks.">geshe</a> and in summer it was done by the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. བླ་རྒྱུད་པ] A term for the common monks in a monastery (in contrast to the scholar monks who were actively studying the Buddhist doctrine).">lagyüba</a>. I was also a lagyüba who is not broadminded and was kind of carefree [Tib. སྐྱིད་པོ་འདྲ་པོ], so I couldn't control the monks very much. At this time, if we made 20 some monks in the tobtsang to study pecha, probably at most 1 or 2 could study pecha. At this time, I had no authority to control them and tell them to study pecha. The gegö even has the power to expel the umdze, if the umdze did something wrong, though usually the umdze and gegö have the equal seats.   

**Q:**  So the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. དགེ་སྐོས] The main disciplinary official in a monastic college (tratsang).">gegö</a> is the judge, right?   

**A:**  Yes.   

**Q:**  Did the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ལྡབ་ལྡོབ] A mildly deviant type of fighting or &quot;punk&quot; monk who engaged in fighting and other unusual behaviors for monks in traditional Tibet&#x27;s large monasteries.">dobdo</a> protest when their <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ལྟོ་ཚང] 1. The club of the Dobdos. 2. A group of people eating together.">tobtsang</a> was eliminated?   

**A:**  No they didn't.   

**Q:**  Whose idea was this first to end the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ལྟོ་ཚང] 1. The club of the Dobdos. 2. A group of people eating together.">tobtsang</a>? Was it the abbot or the idea of the 14 tshondu members?   

**A:**  No it wasn't. The government gave the order at the time of the audience after the Jongyu [Tib. ལྗོངས་རྒྱུ] where the monks go far away. I don't remember the year. I had been umdze for 5 years (in 1954 we think), at this time the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. རྩེ་འགག] The Secretariat Office of the Dalai Lama.">tse ga</a> told all the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. སྒོ་མང] One of the large colleges in Drepung Monastery.">Gomang</a> monastic officials, <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ལས་སྣེ] The general name for all monastic officials.">lene</a> [Tib. ལས་སྣེ] to wait for a moment.   

**Q:**  Was this in <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ནོར་བུ་གླིང་ཁ] The summer palace of the Dalai Lama.">Norbulinga</a>?   

**A:**  Yes. So after finishing the audience in <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ནོར་བུ་གླིང་ཁ] The summer palace of the Dalai Lama.">Norbulinga</a> and the rest of the people returned, the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. སྒོ་མང] One of the large colleges in Drepung Monastery.">Gomang</a> officials stayed behind and Phala [Tib. ཕ་ལྷ] Drönyerchemmo told them that Gomang used to be the source of many great scholars, but nowadays, the study have become declined [Tib. ཉག་ཕྲ]. This is because you <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ལས་སྣེ] The general name for all monastic officials.">lene</a> are not doing your job capably. Then we were saying that if we didn't do something according to this there will be lot of trouble. Actually, in one abbot's period, we should produce 60 <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. དགེ་ཤེས] An advanced degree earned by scholar monks.">geshe</a>, but now there are only 2-3 a year, some time in the future, one geshe migt have to take 2-3 exams. So something has to be done and the abbot also took this matter seriously. At that time, the abbot was Chönphel Jayang la [Tib. ཆོས་འཕེལ་འཇམ་དབང་ལགས], but he couldn't do it effecively [Tib. ཤུགས་ཆེན་པོ]. Then the abbot Kelsang Lengdenla [Tib. སྐལ་བཟང་ལེགས་ལྡན་ལགས] took over and during his time he was trying to do something strongly and we tried to do something on the monk's salary, but due to the hindrance caused by the karmic result against the Buddhism as a whole and also to the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. གྲྭ་ཚང] A &quot;college&quot; within a monastery, for example, in Drepung Monastery there were four main tratsang: Gomang, Loseling, Deyang and Ngagpa. These tratsang were property owning corporate entities and included monks who were organized into residential dormitories called Khamtsen.">tratsang</a>, it didn't work out.   

**Q:**  Did the elimination of <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ལྡབ་ལྡོབ] A mildly deviant type of fighting or &quot;punk&quot; monk who engaged in fighting and other unusual behaviors for monks in traditional Tibet&#x27;s large monasteries.">dobdo</a> tobtsang occured before your trouble?   

**A:**  Yes.   

**Q:**  Can you tell us in detail about the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ལྡབ་ལྡོབ] A mildly deviant type of fighting or &quot;punk&quot; monk who engaged in fighting and other unusual behaviors for monks in traditional Tibet&#x27;s large monasteries.">dobdo</a> <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ལྟོ་ཚང] 1. The club of the Dobdos. 2. A group of people eating together.">tobtsang</a> event and what did you do at that time? After Phala gave the order did you discuss how to eliminate the tobtsang?   

**A:**  There was no convening of the 14 <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཚོགས་འདུ] 1. The general name for the various types of Tibetan government assemblies. 2. Any assembly, e.g., the assembly (meeting) of monks in a college.">tsondu</a> member. The abbot in consultation with the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. དགེ་སྐོས] The main disciplinary official in a monastic college (tratsang).">gegö</a> decided it. They called all the dodbo <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ལྟོ་ཚང] 1. The club of the Dobdos. 2. A group of people eating together.">tobtsang</a> and told them, "from tomorrow on, you cannot do tobtsang any more. And the younger <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ལྡབ་ལྡོབ] A mildly deviant type of fighting or &quot;punk&quot; monk who engaged in fighting and other unusual behaviors for monks in traditional Tibet&#x27;s large monasteries.">dobdo</a> have to study pecha." The dobdo accepted and they discussed among themselves and they went through the motions of giving all their pots and other things to the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. གྲྭ་ཚང] A &quot;college&quot; within a monastery, for example, in Drepung Monastery there were four main tratsang: Gomang, Loseling, Deyang and Ngagpa. These tratsang were property owning corporate entities and included monks who were organized into residential dormitories called Khamtsen.">tratsang</a> and they also made some offerings to the monks and the young doddo were sent to study pecha. For a few months they came to <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཆོས་ར] The special grove (&quot;dharma grove&quot;) in monasteries where monks formally met to practice debating.">chöra</a>, but it seemed to me that gradually the tobtsang might have started again.   

**Q:**  Do you mean that they started the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ལྟོ་ཚང] 1. The club of the Dobdos. 2. A group of people eating together.">tobtsang</a> again stealthily?   

**A:**  There was nothing much anyone could do about this. <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. སྒོ་མང] One of the large colleges in Drepung Monastery.">Gomang</a>'s chagde [Tib. ཕྱག་བདེ], tea and <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཐུག་པ] 1. A porridge or gruel-like soup typically made with tsamba, and if available, meat and cheese. 2. Noodle dishes in broth.">thukpa</a> servers were all <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ལྡབ་ལྡོབ] A mildly deviant type of fighting or &quot;punk&quot; monk who engaged in fighting and other unusual behaviors for monks in traditional Tibet&#x27;s large monasteries.">dobdo</a>. The <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. གྲྭ་ཚང] A &quot;college&quot; within a monastery, for example, in Drepung Monastery there were four main tratsang: Gomang, Loseling, Deyang and Ngagpa. These tratsang were property owning corporate entities and included monks who were organized into residential dormitories called Khamtsen.">tratsang</a> lene, no matter how much they beat them to stop the pushing, the dodbdo say the beating doesn't hurt them and couldn't stop them from pushing. Some dobdo were beaten so badly that their shoulders and arms swelled up and they couldn't take off their vest without cutting it off, but after a few days they were healed and were back doing the same thing again.   

**Q:**  Did they have the idea of geting rid of this?   

**A:**  No. If the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ལྡབ་ལྡོབ] A mildly deviant type of fighting or &quot;punk&quot; monk who engaged in fighting and other unusual behaviors for monks in traditional Tibet&#x27;s large monasteries.">dobdo</a> just push and shove, they aren't beaten, but if they spill porridge and fall, then they would get beaten like the proverb, "stamping people when they fell" [Tib. འགྱེལ་བའི་སྒང་ལ་རྡོག་བརྫིས]. If they could just push and don't spill the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཐུག་པ] 1. A porridge or gruel-like soup typically made with tsamba, and if available, meat and cheese. 2. Noodle dishes in broth.">thukpa</a>, then it was okay. The beatings are done by <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. དགེ་སྐོས] The main disciplinary official in a monastic college (tratsang).">gegö</a>, <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ནང་མ] A minor monk assistant to the Shengo at the Mönlam Chemmo Prayer Festival. These nangma ranked below the Chagdampa.">nangma</a>, <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཆབ་རིལ] The Chabril&#x27;s main work was overseeing serving the traja. He was also the servant of the gegö and khempo. It had a middle status of the types of lene. The chabril was also the one responsible for beating the gong at the tsog and chöra. The chabril got an extra share of gye in the tratsang.">chabril</a>, <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཇ་མ] The monk(s) in charge of a monastery&#x27;s kitchen.">jama</a> and the chabril beats them with a pen holder, nyugdrog [Tib. སྨྱུག་སྒྲོག].   

**Q:**  They say that they put salt in the pen holder?   

**A:**  They probably didn't put salt in it and it was not allowed too. The <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཇ་མ] The monk(s) in charge of a monastery&#x27;s kitchen.">jama</a> holds a large horse head shaped key with a leather strip, but they don't beat them much with key, but they just hit them with the leather strip. If a <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. དགེ་སྐོས] The main disciplinary official in a monastic college (tratsang).">gegö</a> beats <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ལྡབ་ལྡོབ] A mildly deviant type of fighting or &quot;punk&quot; monk who engaged in fighting and other unusual behaviors for monks in traditional Tibet&#x27;s large monasteries.">dobdo</a> he would hit them with a switch on the back 7-8 times which hurts a lot. The switch is wet. The jama stays in kitchen while the porridge is being made, but once it is finished, he comes into the assembly hall and stands there overseeing. There is saying, "the monk's life is passed under the switch" [Tib. གྲྭ་པའི་འཚོ་བ་རྒྱག་པ་འོག་ནས་སྐྱེལ], but they still didn't get bored of it [Tib. བསུན་ཡས་ཡོད་མ་རེད].   

**Q:**  I met some <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. བླ་རྒྱུད་པ] A term for the common monks in a monastery (in contrast to the scholar monks who were actively studying the Buddhist doctrine).">lagyüba</a> who told me that the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. དཔེ་ཆ་བ] A monk studying the monastic philosophical curriculum. A scholar monk.">pechawa</a> are working for themselves and the lagyüba and the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ལྡབ་ལྡོབ] A mildly deviant type of fighting or &quot;punk&quot; monk who engaged in fighting and other unusual behaviors for monks in traditional Tibet&#x27;s large monasteries.">dobdo</a> are the ones who really work for the monastery's benefit. What do you think about this?   

**A:**  You should tell them that if what the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. བླ་རྒྱུད་པ] A term for the common monks in a monastery (in contrast to the scholar monks who were actively studying the Buddhist doctrine).">lagyüba</a> said is right, you can be the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. གྲྭ་ཚང] A &quot;college&quot; within a monastery, for example, in Drepung Monastery there were four main tratsang: Gomang, Loseling, Deyang and Ngagpa. These tratsang were property owning corporate entities and included monks who were organized into residential dormitories called Khamtsen.">tratsang</a> abbot. [laughter] If they can do that, there is no need of the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. དཔེ་ཆ་བ] A monk studying the monastic philosophical curriculum. A scholar monk.">pechawa</a> and then we are wrong in our view. But it is the not the case that if one study the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. དཔེ་ཆ] Religious books/texts, scriptures.">pecha</a>, it is not that he is not allowed to work. At first when we became monk we were saying that we came to study and to practice religion and we leave our white <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཕྱུ་པ] The traditional Tibetan men and women&#x27;s dress. It is like a robe that is tied at the waist. Both men and women wear such dresses, although they differ slightly in color and in style.">chupa</a> with our mothers and put on the red robes of the Buddha. But in these days (present), monks are wearing garments on top of monk's robe. These were not permitted. When you first became the monk, you agree that from now on I'll wear only Buddha's robes. But when we were small we also wore some laymen's clothes. Even I wore some.   

**Q:**  Tashi Tsering: I was born in Namling [Tib. རྣམ་གླིང] and there is a famous monastery called Shang Ganden Chönkhor [Tib. ཤངས་དགའ་ལྡན་ཆོས་འཁོར] which is a Gelugpa Monastery and the monastery of the Gen Thabkhe la [Tib. རྒན་ཐབས་མཁས་ལགས]. When I went there in 1955-56, I had some friends who were <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ལྡབ་ལྡོབ] A mildly deviant type of fighting or &quot;punk&quot; monk who engaged in fighting and other unusual behaviors for monks in traditional Tibet&#x27;s large monasteries.">dobdo</a> and they go to <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. 1. ཆང, 2. བྱང] 1. Tibetan locally brewed barley beer. 2. North; nomad areas north of Lhasa in Nagchuga Prefecture 3. ch. 厂 factory.">chang</a> to collect gifts, büdü [Tib. འབུལ་སྡུད] and trade for the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. གཉེར་ཚང] 1. Storehouse. 2. Steward, person in charge of a storehouse. 3. A monastic official in charge of storerooms.">nyertsang</a> and some of them do trade and some even bought animals from the nomads and sold animals to the butchers [Tib. དམར་ཁེ] in Lhasa and Shigatse. I saw and heard about 1-2 of these. Is there anything like this in <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. སྒོ་མང] One of the large colleges in Drepung Monastery.">Gomang</a>?   

**A:**  Yes there was. In fact, there was a <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. དགེ་ཤེས] An advanced degree earned by scholar monks.">geshe</a> though not of the highest level, but was a real geshe, who died in the year before last year or last year, so monks were calling him as Geshe Sheba, Geshe Butcher [Tib. དགེ་བཤེས་བཤས་པ]. I swear by the Buddha statue in the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཇོ་ཁང] A most famous temple in Lhasa that houses a holy statue of the Buddha. It is often used to mean the Tsuglagang Temple of which it is a part.">Jokhang</a> that the monks call him in that way. This monk also did horse trade. Selling the horse like the people called lorok [Tib. ལོ་རོ་བ] and he also did butcher trade [Tib. བཤས་ཚོང]. When the geshe did this business, he lived at home in Tölung [Tib. སྟོད་ལུང] not in the monastery.   

**Q:**  Was he a <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. དགེ་ཤེས] An advanced degree earned by scholar monks.">geshe</a> who passed the geshe exam?   

**A:**  Yes. Though he was not a high level <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. དགེ་ཤེས] An advanced degree earned by scholar monks.">geshe</a>, he should have known what should be done and what should not be done. This is like what the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. བླ་རྒྱུད་པ] A term for the common monks in a monastery (in contrast to the scholar monks who were actively studying the Buddhist doctrine).">lagyüba</a> said.   

**A:**  When the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. དགེ་ཤེས] An advanced degree earned by scholar monks.">geshe</a> was selling the horse and animals to the butcher, had he lost his celibacy?   

**A:**  I think he had not really lost his celebacy because he was quite old. He was living like a monk and died in that way.   

**Q:**  Did this happen before 1959?   

**A:**  Since before 1959, until the year before last year and last year.   

**Q:**  At that time, wouldn't the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ལས་སྣེ] The general name for all monastic officials.">lene</a> of the monastery tell him that it is wrong?   

**A:**  They wouldn't say much. That's why usually the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ལྡབ་ལྡོབ] A mildly deviant type of fighting or &quot;punk&quot; monk who engaged in fighting and other unusual behaviors for monks in traditional Tibet&#x27;s large monasteries.">dobdo</a> used to say, "if a dobdo loses their celibacy it is considered that he was corrupted or burned by wealth generated from religion such as receiving too much alms and offerings [Tib. དཀོར་གྱིས་འཚིག] but if a <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. དགེ་ཤེས] An advanced degree earned by scholar monks.">geshe</a> loses his celibacy it is said that it is a hindrance on his dharma pratice [Tib. ཆོས་ཀྱི་བར་ཆད]." This is also similar to this saying.   

**Q:**  Did you monks at this time ever think that it might be better to have 3,000 monks who do good prayers rather than having 10,000 monks in Drepung?   

**A:**  Oh no (emphatic). We were hoping and trying to have as many monks as we could have and that will be the best. Then <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཚོག] 1. An offering made of tsamba, butter and dry cheese in the shape of a cone. 2. A prayer assembly meeting in monasteries when all the monks come to an assembly hall and chant prayers together.">tshog</a> and <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཆོས་ར] The special grove (&quot;dharma grove&quot;) in monasteries where monks formally met to practice debating.">chöra</a> will become very large. If there are many monks who came to attend chöra this is the monk's work. Like the proverb, "if some one leaned against the golden mountain, all of the surrounding will become gold." [Tib. གང་ཞིག་གསེར་གྱི་རི་ལ་བསྙེས་གྱུར་ན།དེ་ཡི་འདབས་བྱ་ཐམས་ཅད་གསེར་དུ་འགྱུར] [Meaning if you stay with a good person, you will also become good] It is better to have more monks. The problem was the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ལས་སྣེ] The general name for all monastic officials.">lene</a> officials of the monastery didn't do the right thing. The government had given the monks many <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཆོས་གཤིས] A &quot;religious&quot; estate held by a monastery or lama.">chöshi</a>. If most of the income from the chöshi was given to the monks though they could have stored a little bit, then if the lene told the monks to study well, they will listen to them. In the past, the monks who didn't study couldn't stay in the monastery, but later though there was a strict discipline. The lene didn't do well and it became like <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. དགེ་ཤེས] An advanced degree earned by scholar monks.">geshe</a> are not allowed to work and the shengo was only done by the lagyüba. Actually, if the geshe become shengo and <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. དགེ་སྐོས] The main disciplinary official in a monastic college (tratsang).">gegö</a>, it would be very good and when they talk on the assembly, it will be a different one because they will talk according to the religion. It is said that the Buddhism is depended on the monks' community. But if the monks didn't study <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. དཔེ་ཆ] Religious books/texts, scriptures.">pecha</a> it will not depend on the monks even though there is a large number.   

**Q:**  What is the difference of the duties between <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཕྱག་སྦུག] A manager (of estates and endowments) of a monastic college or monastic khamtsen.">chabu</a> and <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. གཉེར་ཚང] 1.

**A:**  The 2 <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. གཉེར་ཚང] 1. Storehouse. 2. Steward, person in charge of a storehouse. 3. A monastic official in charge of storerooms.">nyertsang</a>'s work is for giving <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. བཏོང་སྒོ] An obligation to carry out a rite or prayer session in a monastery. For example, providing food and tea for all the monks in one&#x27;s monastic college at a prayer assembly. Or it could be an obligation to give all the monks a set amount of grain or the donggo obligation that many monastery office holders had to do when they left office. Generally, donggos had associated endowments that monks used by turns to fund a donggo. The monk with the donggo obligation would lend out the capital of the endowment and pay for the event from the interest he collected. This was also used for ritual obligations of government offices like the Tseja Office.">donggo</a> for <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. གྲྭ་ཇ] The prayer session sponsored by the tratsang (college) at which tea was served to its monks who attended.">traja</a> etc. The <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. གྲྭ་ཚང] A &quot;college&quot; within a monastery, for example, in Drepung Monastery there were four main tratsang: Gomang, Loseling, Deyang and Ngagpa. These tratsang were property owning corporate entities and included monks who were organized into residential dormitories called Khamtsen.">tratsang</a> has several <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཆོས་གཤིས] A &quot;religious&quot; estate held by a monastery or lama.">chöshi</a>, they collect the yield from these and also have nomads who took the animals as a lease [Tib. ཤེ] in Yangbajen [Tib. ཡངས་པ་ཅན], Nyenrong [Tib. སྙན་རོང] and there was also a household called Kyangru [Tib. རྐྱང་རུ]. From these nomads they get 500 <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཁལ] A traditional volume measurement used for measuring grain in traditional Tibetan society. Sizes of this unit varied somewhat, but the official government khe (called mkhar ru or bstan dzin mkha ru) weighed about 28-31 pounds for barley. It was used to convey the size of fields. For example, a field said to be 10 khe in size meant that 10 khe of seed could be sown on that field.">khe</a> of butter in one year as the lease. In one year <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. སྒོ་མང] One of the large colleges in Drepung Monastery.">Gomang</a> needs 1,000 khe of butter for the traja etc., so we have to find another 500 khe of butter for use. The two nyertsang have a good <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཐོན] In monasteries, a title for monks who have finished their monastic job obligations (tib. ཐོན་ཟིན).">thön</a> [Tib. ཐོན] because after they are finished their term of nyertsang then they were allowed to go for the candidates of the jiso. The nyertsang work is not easy, if you don't have a good harvest year, it is mostly a loss for the holder. E.G., in one year, there are 8 session <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཆོས་ཐོག] A monastic &quot;academic semester.&quot; A period of studying/debating in the monastic curriculum that is something like a term or semester. A period of time when monks were engaged in formal studying. There were eight chöthog in a year: the autumn chöthog (tönchö [tib. སྟོན་ཆོས]) was for one month, the summer chöthog (yarchö [tib. དབྱར་ཆོས]) was for one month, the winter chöthog (günchö [tib. དགུན་ཆོས]) was for one month, and the spring chöthog (jichö [tib. དཔྱིད་ཆོས]) was for one month. Then there were also two monthly chöra called dachö [tib. ཟླ་ཆོས] and two 15 day chöra called jönga chöra [tib. བཅོ་ལྔ་ཆོས་ར].">chöthog</a>; 4 monthly <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཆོས་ར] The special grove (&quot;dharma grove&quot;) in monasteries where monks formally met to practice debating.">chöra</a>, dachö [Tib. ཟླ་ཆོས] and 2 chöra on the 20th, 2 chöra on the 15th and the total is 190 days). For one dachö the nyertsang have to give 25 traja each month. Then the monks have to go to beg for fire wood shinglong [Tib. ཤིང་སློང] for 4 days and 1 day is on the road for attending the assembly. That's how the 30 days are calculated. So there were 25 traja in a month when there is chöra, when they weigh the butter, they use the scale called tongnyag [Tib. སྟོང་ཉག] which is little smaller than the usual scale. And they use 4 khe of butter for each traja. When they put in the butter and tea, a representative from the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. བླ་བྲང] 1. The property/wealth owning corporate entity of an incarnate lama. 2. The property/wealth owning corporate entity of the Panchen Lama.">labrang</a> and a representative from the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. དགེ་སྐོས] The main disciplinary official in a monastic college (tratsang).">gegö</a> would come and weigh the tea and butter.   

**Q:**  If they couldn't collect it from the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. གཞིས་ཀ] A manorial estate.">shiga</a> they have to pay their own money and buy these, right?   

**A:**  Yes.   

**Q:**  Then the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. གཉེར་ཚང] 1. Storehouse. 2. Steward, person in charge of a storehouse. 3. A monastic official in charge of storerooms.">nyertsang</a>'s job is basically giving the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. གྲྭ་ཇ] The prayer session sponsored by the tratsang (college) at which tea was served to its monks who attended.">traja</a>?   

**Q:**  How much butter did you have to put on the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. གྲྭ་ཇ] The prayer session sponsored by the tratsang (college) at which tea was served to its monks who attended.">traja</a> on the 20th and the 15th?   

**A:**  It is the same 4 <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཁལ] A traditional volume measurement used for measuring grain in traditional Tibetan society. Sizes of this unit varied somewhat, but the official government khe (called mkhar ru or bstan dzin mkha ru) weighed about 28-31 pounds for barley. It was used to convey the size of fields. For example, a field said to be 10 khe in size meant that 10 khe of seed could be sown on that field.">khe</a> for each tea.   

**A:**  Yes, and if there isn't enough yield from the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. གཞིས་ཀ] A manorial estate.">shiga</a> then they have to pay for it themselves. For nyishu <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཆོས་ར] The special grove (&quot;dharma grove&quot;) in monasteries where monks formally met to practice debating.">chöra</a>, they give 16 traja. And three days for shinglong and 1 day on the road. Shinglong used to be the custom when monks go for begging for firewood. But in my time they no longer did this and it is just a name. However, there is one shinglong in <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. འཇང་དགུན་ཆོས] The special winter debating session for monks that was held annually in the area called Jang.">Jang günchö</a>, the monks have to cross the mountain pass and go to the upper part of place called Gyer Lhapa [Tib. ?lha pa]and for one day they go to get firewood. The upper part of Gyer Lhapa is all forest. The monks cut the trees and carry some on their backs. That night, they ask for the lodging in the shiga called Gyer Lhapa. The shiga gives them 4 tea and 4 <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཐུག་པ] 1. A porridge or gruel-like soup typically made with tsamba, and if available, meat and cheese. 2. Noodle dishes in broth.">thukpa</a> and a ladle size serving of <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. རྩམ་པ] The traditional Tibetan staple food that consists of grain that is roasted (popped), usually in heated sand, and then ground into a flour.">tsamba</a>. That night they do the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཚོག] 1. An offering made of tsamba, butter and dry cheese in the shape of a cone. 2. A prayer assembly meeting in monasteries when all the monks come to an assembly hall and chant prayers together.">tshog</a> and they sleep in a big house where hay is stored. And the next day they return via <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. འཇང] 1. The area called Jang. 2. The special winter debating session for monks that was held annually in Jang.">Jang</a>me [Tib. འཇང་སྨད] which was a shiga of Ratö [Tib. ར་སྟོད]. There they stop for a meal and they get 4 tea and 4 thukpa. Then they return to Jang güncho area and leave the wood they carry to the kitchen. Then they have a <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཚོགས] 1. A prayer assembly meeting in monasteries when all the monks come to an assembly hall and chant prayers together. 2. An offering made of tsamba, butter and dry cheese in the shape of a cone.">tsog</a> and they get tea. The monks in this time, since they don't go for shinglong, they go to park during the days that are specified as shinglong. The 15th chöra has 12 days of tea and 2 days of shinglong and 1 day of travel. The dachö will end on the 3rd of the month. Just before ending the dachö on 30th of the month there is a dachö düsang [Tib. དུས་བཟང] and they get five times of tea and thukpa. Morning and evening they get a thugba and between they get 3 teas. The thugba is tsamthug. The tsamba soup. Then in the protectiveb deity chapel, <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. མགོན་ཁང] A chapel devoted to a protector deity.">gönkhang</a> [Tib. མགོན་ཁང] there are two kinds of <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. གཏོར་མ] A ritual offering made from tsamba and water.">torma</a>; one is made by the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. བླ་བྲང] 1.
