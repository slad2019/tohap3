**Q:**  How many <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. མི་ཚན] A sub-unit of a khamtsen.">mitsen</a> are there under Hamdong, [Tib. ཧར་གདོང] and Samlo, [Tib. བསམ་ལྷོ] ?   

**A:**  Hamdong had 9 <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. མི་ཚན] A sub-unit of a khamtsen.">mitsen</a>, but in Washu [Tib.?] Misten there were three mitsen merged together. Then there were: Hor Mitsen, Tsokha [Tib. མཚོ་ཁ་བ] Mitsen, Jüchö [Tib. འཇུ་ཆོས] Mitsen, Tsenpo, [Tib. བཙན་པོ] and there was Jangya [Tib. ལྕང་སྐྱ] Mitsen which is also called Gunglung [Tib. གུང་ལུང] Mitsen. This is the mitsen of Jankya Rolpey Dorje [Tib. ལྕང་སྐྱ་རོལ་པའི་རྡོ་རྗེ] and this goes to both Samlo and Hamdong then there is Thorgö [Tib. ཐོར་རྒོད] Mitsen.   

**Q:**  Does Tsenpo Mitsen goes to both Samlo and Hamdong?   

**A:**  Yes.   

**Q:**  How about Lamba, [Tib. ལམ་པ]?   

**A:**  Lamba <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. མི་ཚན] A sub-unit of a khamtsen.">mitsen</a> I think is under Samlo but I'm not perfectly sure. Tölung Lampa [Tib. སྟོད་ལུང་ལམ་པ] is belonged to this mitsen. There were two böbashung in <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. སྒོ་མང] One of the large colleges in Drepung Monastery.">Gomang</a> and one in <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. བློ་གསལ་གླིང] One of the main colleges in Drepung Monastery.">Loseling</a> which neither belonged to Hamdong nor Samlo and in Gomang they have the Gadong [Tib. དགའ་གདོང] Mitsen and böbashung and the shengo goes only from these two mitsen.

**A:**  It is Inner Mongolian.   

**Q:**  Was there any belonged to Hor Misten other than the people from the north, Horpa [Tib. ཧོར་པ]?

In monastic settings it also refers to an adult monk who acted as a guardian to a younger monk. In such cases, the younger monk typically lived in the gegen&#x27;s apartment (shag). In monasteries, however, it could also mean a real teacher, or the monk who served as the guarantor for a new monk.">gegen</a> was Hor it was that they will admit 10 <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. བོད་པ] 1. A person from Central Tibet (tib. དབུས) or sometimes someone from political Tibet in contrast to persons from Kham and Amdo. 2. Böpa is also used nowadays as a general name for all ethnic Tibetans.">böba</a> every year. When I became a monk I had to give 25 <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. སྲང] A unit of traditional Tibetan currency. It was also called ngüsang [tib. དངུལ་སྲང]. 50 nügsang = 1 dotse; 10 sho = 1 nügsang; 20 5-karma coins = 1 ngüsang. There were also paper currency notes of 7-sang, 25-sang, and 10-sang denominations.">sang</a> for the shugja. Later, there is a 4 days <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཚོགས] 1.

The <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. གྲྭ་ཚང] A &quot;college&quot; within a monastery, for example, in Drepung Monastery there were four main tratsang: Gomang, Loseling, Deyang and Ngagpa. These tratsang were property owning corporate entities and included monks who were organized into residential dormitories called Khamtsen.">tratsang</a> and big <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཁང་ཚན] A monastic residential unit in which monks from specific geographic areas lived. These were corporate entities with property and internal officials. Some large khamtsen had smaller subordinate units called mi tshan. Khamtsen were part of tratsang (colleges). For example, Hamdong Khamtsen was part of Gomang College in Drepung Monastery.">khamtsen</a> don't have this. It is mostly done in the mitsen like Hor mitsen. For example, in Hor mitsen there are many <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. དཔེ་ཆ་བ] A monk studying the monastic philosophical curriculum. A scholar monk.">pechawa</a> and the tsog is big. The reason is that if you are studying <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. དཔེ་ཆ] Religious books/texts, scriptures.">pecha</a> you don't have to do the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. གཉེར་པ] A steward or manager. In some monasteries, the nyerpa was in charge of storerooms under the authority of a higher manager called a chandzö.">nyerpa</a>. So everyone does this. If you are nyerpa, then you have to give many <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. བཏོང་སྒོ] An obligation to carry out a rite or prayer session in a monastery. For example, providing food and tea for all the monks in one&#x27;s monastic college at a prayer assembly. Or it could be an obligation to give all the monks a set amount of grain or the donggo obligation that many monastery office holders had to do when they left office. Generally, donggos had associated endowments that monks used by turns to fund a donggo. The monk with the donggo obligation would lend out the capital of the endowment and pay for the event from the interest he collected. This was also used for ritual obligations of government offices like the Tseja Office.">donggo</a> and it's hard.

**A:**  No   

**Q:**  What about Mongolian, Japanese and Chinese?   

**A:**  Yes they can all go except böpa.   

**Q:**  Is there a reason for this?   

**A:**  Yes it is the reason of where you belonged to [Tib. ཐོབ་ཁུངས]. The most important is to have ones who will take care of the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཁང་ཚན] A monastic residential unit in which monks from specific geographic areas lived. These were corporate entities with property and internal officials. Some large khamtsen had smaller subordinate units called mi tshan. Khamtsen were part of tratsang (colleges). For example, Hamdong Khamtsen was part of Gomang College in Drepung Monastery.">khamtsen</a> well [he implies böpa won't do this].   

**Q:**  I heard from a monk about the saying, "the monastery is like an ocean where there are many different fishes" which means there are different kind of monks. Did you hear this?   

**A:**  Yes, we had a saying, "the great monastic seats are same as big oceans where there are fishes and frogs" [Tib. grwa sa chen po dang rgya mtsho chen po gcig pa yin/ de'i nang nya dang sbal pa yod".In the great monastic seats, there are very good monks and also there are some monks who are worse than laymen. Actually, ཐིས་ཨིས་རེདིཅུལིང, [Tib. ཞབས་སྦྱོར] the great monastic seats. The monks that come from the branch monastery do not have any choice but to learn the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. དཔེ་ཆ] Religious books/texts, scriptures.">pecha</a> reciting in the assembly. This is because these branch monasteries have only few monks. But in the great monastcic seats it should be like this and it is the not beneficial for the Buddhism by only having many monks. If there are monks who really learn the pecha, this is beneficial to the Buddhism. But actually there were too many monks and it was too disorderly, [Tib. རོབ་ཚ་ཐག་ཆོད] and there were many who do noty learn the pecha and there are great ones.   

**Q:**  Don't the people regard that the monks are better than the laymen in terms of karmic law of cause and effect, [Tib. ལས་རྒྱུ་འབྲས]?   

**A:**  Probably it might be like this but in reality the mind is really complicated. [laughter].   

**Q:**  No matter this is real or not, but was there that kind of saying in the past?   

**A:**  There is no saying that the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ལྡབ་ལྡོབ] A mildly deviant type of fighting or &quot;punk&quot; monk who engaged in fighting and other unusual behaviors for monks in traditional Tibet&#x27;s large monasteries.">dobdo</a> are bad.

It is often used to mean the Tsuglagang Temple of which it is a part.">Jokhang</a>, [Tib. ཇོ་བོ་རིན་པོ་ཆེ] that among the dobdo, there are some sidhi,[Tib. grub thop]. But among the great <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. དགེ་ཤེས] An advanced degree earned by scholar monks.">geshe</a>, some of them are strange. For example, even now there are some spending their lives as before. Maybe, they are pretending not to have any knowledge. Some are too knowledgeable, [Tib. མཁྱེན་རྒྱ་ཆེ་ཐག་ཆོད] and do all the opposite things. We can see these people now. So it is hard to say. [laughter]
