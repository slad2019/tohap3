**Q:**  Did they have the right to say that they are not going to sell it?   

**A:**  No. At this time, I was about 20-21 years old. If I tell the truth, I was very rash or forceful [Tib. འར་པོ] but also truthful. So the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. མི་སེར] A term that can mean serf/bound subject as well as citizen, depending on context. For example, the miser of a lord would connote the bound subjects of that lord, whereas the miser of Tibet would connote citizens of Tibet.">miser</a> liked me and I didn't have any comments from the miser. Once, when I was doing this we lost one load of butter packed in skin bag, martang [Tib. མར་ལྟང]. The people watching the butter were two people from two families and we had piched the tent. We paid them one <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. བྲེ] A unit of traditional volume measurement [a container] in Tibet, 20 of which typically equaled one khe or bo [also a container], although in some areas there were only 16 dre in one khe.">dre</a> of <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. རྩམ་པ] The traditional Tibetan staple food that consists of grain that is roasted (popped), usually in heated sand, and then ground into a flour.">tsamba</a> per day for watching. One day I found that one butter load was missing. So I told these two that if they didn't find the butter they had to replace it. The lost butter load was about <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཁལ] A traditional volume measurement used for measuring grain in traditional Tibetan society. Sizes of this unit varied somewhat, but the official government khe (called mkhar ru or bstan dzin mkha ru) weighed about 28-31 pounds for barley. It was used to convey the size of fields. For example, a field said to be 10 khe in size meant that 10 khe of seed could be sown on that field.">khe</a> 7 and a few nyaga. So we called all the nomad household heads together and told them about the loss and made them all pick up a butter load that was about the same size to know what size was lost. When one of the person name Buchung [Tib. བུ་ཆུང] when his turn came to pick up the load he was shivering, but I didn't tell him anything. So then we said we are leaving and you should do something about this before we return next year. You should search the houses [Tib. ཁྱིམ་སློག་རྒྱབ] and I will settle it next year. I thought it was Buchung, but I didn't say anything that year, although I told some people that I suspect it was Hor Buchung. We had attched small placard, [Tib. ཤིང་བྱང] to the butter load on which the name of the household and the weight of the butter was written. So they found that the butter had already been taken out and repacked into small skin bags. But we found the empty skin bag in Buchung's house The weight of the butter load was still with the empty skin container. After this, I had no trouble with theft. Since then, no butter was lost.   

**Q:**  With respect to selling things, pütsong [Tib. སྤུས་ཚོང] how do you decide how much butter you should sell?   

**A:**  The tribe, tshopa [Tib. ཚོ་པ] would decide this. He collects the cheese and butter and we give him the tea and khata. I am not sure how he distributes it to the nomads, probably by the number of animals they had.   

**Q:**  Did you have a fix amount to sell?   

**A:**  It is according to the old system. There is a fixed amount-there is a list that both the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. གཉེར་ཚང] 1. Storehouse. 2. Steward, person in charge of a storehouse. 3. A monastic official in charge of storerooms.">nyertsang</a> and thsopa have. It is fixed. In this tshopa, in the old days there were only 7 households in the place called Kyangru [Tib. རྐྱང་རུ] according to the old registration, but when I went there were about 40 household Its not far from here (about 3 hrs by car).   

**Q:**  To which county it is belonged to nowadays?   

**A:**  It is located in Markyang in the upper part of Sangshung [Tib. གསང་ཞུང]. You get there after crossing the Dam Jogtse la [Tib. ལྕོག་རྩེ་ལ]. Probably, it belonged to Damshung [Tib. འདམ་གཞུང] Dzong. The butter is collected by the tshopa for all the household. The <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཁ་བཏགས] A Tibetan ceremonial scarf given to lamas, visitors, etc.">khata</a> are picked up by each family. They bring cheese and he gives them khata. The cheese is measured by the bog<a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. བྲེ] A unit of traditional volume measurement [a container] in Tibet, 20 of which typically equaled one khe or bo [also a container], although in some areas there were only 16 dre in one khe.">dre</a> [Tib. བོགས་བྲེ] that is very large. It takes only 10 such dre to fill a <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. བསྟན་འཛིན་མཁའ་རུ་ཨོར་གཏན་ཚིགས་མཁའ་རུ] The official Tibetan government volume measurement used for measuring grain. It weighed about 28-31 pounds for barley. It was also used to convey the size of fields. For example, a field said to be 10 tenzin kharu in size meant that 10 tenzin kharu of seed could be sown on that field.">tenzin kharu</a>, [thus the nomads are screwed twice, once for force selling and once by dre]. The ngaga for weighing butter was little bit bigger than the normal one.   

**Q:**  Did you take your <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཉ་ག] A weight measurement unit. About 10 nyaga was equal to one gyama, which weighed 1.1 lbs.).">nyaga</a> with you?   

**A:**  Yes.   

**Q:**  Who fixes the exchange rate? And how much was it the rate of exchanging tea in your book for the forced selling [Tib. འབམ་ཚོང]?   

**A:**  This is fixed in the old book. Probably, for the forced selling it was 8 bakhag, [Tib. སྦག་ཁག] of tea exchanging 8 <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཁལ] A traditional volume measurement used for measuring grain in traditional Tibetan society. Sizes of this unit varied somewhat, but the official government khe (called mkhar ru or bstan dzin mkha ru) weighed about 28-31 pounds for barley. It was used to convey the size of fields. For example, a field said to be 10 khe in size meant that 10 khe of seed could be sown on that field.">khe</a> of butter. One bakhag = 4 bagchung [Tib. སྦག་ཆུང]. In the first year when I went there, the market price for butter about 22 <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. སྲང] A unit of traditional Tibetan currency. It was also called ngüsang [tib. དངུལ་སྲང]. 50 nügsang = 1 dotse; 10 sho = 1 nügsang; 20 5-karma coins = 1 ngüsang. There were also paper currency notes of 7-sang, 25-sang, and 10-sang denominations.">sang</a> and 5 zho for one khe of butter and in the next day it went up to 50 sang. Tashi Tsering: says it increased to about 4 <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. རྡོ་ཚད] A currency unit in traditional Tibet that was equal to 50 ngüsang.">dotse</a> in 1955-56. We bought our butter from Banakshöl's [Tib. སྦྲ་ནག་ཞོལ] Jangdongtsang [Tib. 'cang sdong tshang] inn keeper [Tib. གནས་མོ]. Jangdongtsang's son was a <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. རྩེ་དྲུང] A monk official in the Tibetan government.">tsidrung</a> trainee in <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཡིག་ཚང] The highest office dealing with monastic and religious affairs in the traditional Tibetan government. It is often called the Ecclesiastic Office. It was headed by 4 fourth rank monk officials called Trunyichemmo. The senior Trunyichemmo was called Ta Lama.">Yigtsang</a> [Tib. ཏིག་ཚང་སློབ་ཕྲུག] and his <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. དགེ་རྒན] 1. Teacher in a school. 2. In monastic settings it also refers to an adult monk who acted as a guardian to a younger monk. In such cases, the younger monk typically lived in the gegen&#x27;s apartment (shag). In monasteries, however, it could also mean a real teacher, or the monk who served as the guarantor for a new monk.">gegen</a> was the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. དགེ་ཕྲུག] 1. Student. 2. Disciple. 3. Commonly the name for monks living with a gegen or teacher. These are more like wards than real disciples.">gidru</a> of our Nyertsang collegue.   

**Q:**  Was the amount of forced selling things like tea and <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཁ་བཏགས] A Tibetan ceremonial scarf given to lamas, visitors, etc.">khata</a> a fixed number?   

**A:**  Yes. When they sell tea and those stuffs privately, it was real tea and sold for real price and they pay money for that.   

**Q:**  When the price of butter rose a lot, didn't the nomads complain or oppose when they still get paid the fixed rate?   

**Q:** . They would not do that because it was called forced selling But for extra sales they charged regular rate. When I went to <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. 1. ཆང, 2. བྱང] 1. Tibetan locally brewed barley beer. 2. North; nomad areas north of Lhasa in Nagchuga Prefecture 3. ch. 厂 factory.">chang</a>, I and my <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཤག་ཚང] 1. The household or family of a monk that consisted of multiple monks. 2. The apartment of a monk household.">shagtsang</a> didn't sell anything. Basically I carried things like tea as gifts to be given when the nomads gave me yogurt and milk.   

**Q:**  The butter you got was sheep butter or yak butter?   

**A:**  When we got the butter it was mostly yak butter. Since they had few sheep in this area. While we stayed there, the tsopa had to give <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. བཏོང་སྒོ] An obligation to carry out a rite or prayer session in a monastery. For example, providing food and tea for all the monks in one&#x27;s monastic college at a prayer assembly. Or it could be an obligation to give all the monks a set amount of grain or the donggo obligation that many monastery office holders had to do when they left office. Generally, donggos had associated endowments that monks used by turns to fund a donggo. The monk with the donggo obligation would lend out the capital of the endowment and pay for the event from the interest he collected. This was also used for ritual obligations of government offices like the Tseja Office.">donggo</a> for 3 days and 1 day by the gembo.   

**Q:**  How many people were there in the tshopa?   

**A:**  When we arrive, the tsopa pitch a huge tent for us. The tsopa is the collectivity of the fathers from the 44 nomad households. The head of the tsopa is the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. རྒན་བོ] A village headman. Such headmen were responsible for organizing the different households to pay the village&#x27;s taxes in-kind and labor. They also played a role in settling minor disputes and were the link between the village and the higher authorities. In some areas they were elected by the village households, while in others the position was hereditary or appointed.">gembo</a> and jimi [Tib. སྤྱི་མི].   

**Q:**  The tsopa's 3 day <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. བཏོང་སྒོ] An obligation to carry out a rite or prayer session in a monastery. For example, providing food and tea for all the monks in one&#x27;s monastic college at a prayer assembly. Or it could be an obligation to give all the monks a set amount of grain or the donggo obligation that many monastery office holders had to do when they left office. Generally, donggos had associated endowments that monks used by turns to fund a donggo. The monk with the donggo obligation would lend out the capital of the endowment and pay for the event from the interest he collected. This was also used for ritual obligations of government offices like the Tseja Office.">donggo</a> was like giving a party, right?   

**A:**  Yes. This was also given according to what was the writen in the book. In one day, there is as much tea as you can drink. They also give a square of butter mix with dry cheese called thüjug [Tib. འཐུད་ལྕུག] to each person in their group. On top of this, they put three smaller pieces of thü. The <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. སྐུ་ངོ] An honorific term of address for aristocratic officials. It is something like, &quot;Your Excellency.&quot;">kungö</a> the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. གཉེར་པ] A steward or manager. In some monasteries, the nyerpa was in charge of storerooms under the authority of a higher manager called a chandzö.">nyerpa</a> and all the servants get the same thing.   

**Q:**  Did you have the system of counting the animals once every three years?   

**A:**  Yes we count the number of the animals once every three years when the one <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. གཉེར་ཚང] 1. Storehouse. 2. Steward, person in charge of a storehouse. 3. A monastic official in charge of storerooms.">nyertsang</a> term is over and when the new nyertsang came. I think we calculated 5 sheep = one yak, and 6 goats = 1 yak. I don't remember it the tax was on horns, [Tib. ར་ཉག] of animals or the heads, mgo nyag]. If its horns, the tax is more and every thing was converted to the big animals.   

**Q:**  There was another system where they divide the pastures according to the increased and decreases number of animals. Did you have that?   

**A:**  No. The better households in this nomad area had about 100 milking yak. In Yangbajen, [Tib. ཡངས་པ་ཅན] there was a household called Thangpa [Tib. ཐང་པ] who was the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. རྒན་བོ] A village headman. Such headmen were responsible for organizing the different households to pay the village&#x27;s taxes in-kind and labor. They also played a role in settling minor disputes and were the link between the village and the higher authorities. In some areas they were elected by the village households, while in others the position was hereditary or appointed.">gembo</a>, he had 440 yaks when we counted the nunmber. There were 20 odd household called <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. སྒོ་མང] One of the large colleges in Drepung Monastery.">Gomang</a> Tö [Tib. སྒོ་མང་སྟོད] whose entire total number of animals was less than Thangpa. My mother's father's household was known as Tölung Phangdong Simkhang [Tib. སྟོད་ལུང་འཕྲང་གདོང་གཟིམ་ཁང]. My Mother's father came to my household Gangkyi [Tib. sgang skiyd ?] as bridegroom. The household was a very big one. His friend was Thangpai Gyentsen [Tib. ཐང་པའི་རྒྱལ་མཚན] and helping each other in threshing by driving the yaks on the grain stock, [Tib. ཕྱུགས་ཆག་སྐོར]. They would invite me as a guest rto their home. They got 1,000 <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཁལ] A traditional volume measurement used for measuring grain in traditional Tibetan society. Sizes of this unit varied somewhat, but the official government khe (called mkhar ru or bstan dzin mkha ru) weighed about 28-31 pounds for barley. It was used to convey the size of fields. For example, a field said to be 10 khe in size meant that 10 khe of seed could be sown on that field.">khe</a> of grain for the yield in a year and they had only 4 people.   

**Q:**  Did the nomads live in tent or house.   

**A:**  They lived in tents but some had small grain storage houses. When I went to nomad area, they had tents with 6-7 pillars. In the middle was the stove, they make <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. རྩམ་པ] The traditional Tibetan staple food that consists of grain that is roasted (popped), usually in heated sand, and then ground into a flour.">tsamba</a> everyday by grinding it with a grinding stone. At that time, the nomads put their grain in wet yak skins and pile them up.   

**Q:**  Did any household go extinct from among the 40 some household during your period?   

**A:**  No, but there were some big households fought that resulted in households splitting into two. The <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. གཉེར་ཚང] 1. Storehouse. 2. Steward, person in charge of a storehouse. 3. A monastic official in charge of storerooms.">nyertsang</a> settled these disputes.   

**Q:**  Did they have to report the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. གཉེར་ཚང] 1. Storehouse. 2. Steward, person in charge of a storehouse. 3. A monastic official in charge of storerooms.">nyertsang</a> that they are going to get divided?   

**A:**  They would make law suites internally.   

**Q:**  Did they have to report the monastery?   

**A:**  If they are belonged to <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. གཉེར་ཚང] 1. Storehouse. 2. Steward, person in charge of a storehouse. 3. A monastic official in charge of storerooms.">nyertsang</a>, the nyertsang would settle it because the nyertsang was their main lord. When a household gets divided, each gave a gift called first offering of the division, göpü [Tib. བགོས་ཕུད] to the nyertsang. This was a rule from the early times.   

**Q:**  Were there such divisions during your time?   

**A:**  In my time there was a dispute between a big household called Mani Drachen [Tib. མ་ནི་སྦྲ་ཆེན] The father and mother had a fight and each split taking some of the kids with them. The source of the fight was a wife's mother who lived separately and was a real troublemaker. The division was settled by the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. གཉེར་ཚང] 1. Storehouse. 2. Steward, person in charge of a storehouse. 3. A monastic official in charge of storerooms.">nyertsang</a>. The nyertsang received 6 animals for the göpü.   

**Q:**  What was the reason for the dispute.   

**A:**  The father said the mother is not okay, and the mother said that the father is not okay. There was no real big reason for the dispute amd all of them were old. They had older kids. The oldest son was the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. རྒན་བོ] A village headman. Such headmen were responsible for organizing the different households to pay the village&#x27;s taxes in-kind and labor. They also played a role in settling minor disputes and were the link between the village and the higher authorities. In some areas they were elected by the village households, while in others the position was hereditary or appointed.">gembo</a> of the area whio was called <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. སྒོ་མང] One of the large colleges in Drepung Monastery.">Gomang</a> Gembo.   

**Q:**  Did the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. གཉེར་ཚང] 1. Storehouse. 2. Steward, person in charge of a storehouse. 3. A monastic official in charge of storerooms.">nyertsang</a> appoint the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. རྒན་བོ] A village headman.

They also played a role in settling minor disputes and were the link between the village and the higher authorities. In some areas they were elected by the village households, while in others the position was hereditary or appointed.">gembo</a>?   

**A:**  Yes. In the end they split into two houses and both became poor. There was a saying, "if you divide the rich, they will become beggars and if the poor join to together, they will become rich" [Tib. ཕྱུག་པོ་བགོས་ན་སྤྲང་པོ་དང་། དབུལ་པོ་བསྒྲིལ་ན་ཕྱུག་པོ]. After this, 2-3 years passed and they decided themselves to go back together again like before. When our household did the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. གཉེར་ཚང] 1. Storehouse. 2. Steward, person in charge of a storehouse. 3. A monastic official in charge of storerooms.">nyertsang</a>, it was quite early and I was about 23.   

**Q:**  How did you divide the property? Did you divide them according to the number of people or according to the sex?   

**A:**  It was by number of people without regard to sex.   

**Q:**  What did they say? What reasons?   

**A:**  They just said they want to separate. We separated just by numbers we didn't say who was right or wrong. The old grandmother was whipped by the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. གཉེར་ཚང] 1. Storehouse. 2. Steward, person in charge of a storehouse. 3. A monastic official in charge of storerooms.">nyertsang</a> for stirring up trouble. She had caused many disputes in the past, so we whipped her. After we whipped her she gave us no trouble. In the end the profit went to the nyertsang and they got 6 cattle.   

**Q:**  What is the difference in the interaction of household is monastery and society? In society, there are 10 household and you have some good relations with some and bad relation with others and middle with some. Is it same in monastery?

The senior monks are usually served tea with a lot of shag.">shag</a> like in the society. If some shag had good relations during <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. དགེ་རྒན] 1. Teacher in a school. 2. In monastic settings it also refers to an adult monk who acted as a guardian to a younger monk. In such cases, the younger monk typically lived in the gegen&#x27;s apartment (shag).

Student. 2. Disciple. 3. Commonly the name for monks living with a gegen or teacher. These are more like wards than real disciples.">gidru</a>'s time.   

**Q:**  Was the custom of male homosexual partner, drombo, the [Tib. མགྲོན་པོ] widespread in the monastery?   

**A:**  It was very widespread. Nowadays there is no propblem. In the past, it was the cause of fights and even killing due to jealousy.   

**Q:**  When you were the umdze, was drombo custom conspicous [Tib. མངོན་གསལ་དོད་པོ] in the Drepung <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. སྒོ་མང] One of the large colleges in Drepung Monastery.">Gomang</a> Tratsang?

**A:**  Yes. There were and even when people were going on the road, they did that?   

**Q:**  Didn't they say that they were catching drombo?   

**A:**  Yes. TT: In the past when I was going along the Yuthog [Tib. g'yu thog] Bridge in Lhasa, a <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ལྡབ་ལྡོབ] A mildly deviant type of fighting or &quot;punk&quot; monk who engaged in fighting and other unusual behaviors for monks in traditional Tibet&#x27;s large monasteries.">dobdo</a> from Drepung was coming along the other way. I was afraid of dobdo. I looked at him and he was looking/staring at me a lot. So I ran as I was afraid. It was a dobdo wearing a dark maroon-blackish lower garment, shamthok. [Tib. ཤམ་ཐབ]. He hit me with his sword scabbard on my back, but he didn't catch me. He said to me, "why am I not allow to look at you?" [Tib. ངས་ཁྱེད་རང་ལ་ལྟ་མ་ཆོག་པ་ག་རེ་རེད]"   

**A:**  Yes there was almost no <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ལྡབ་ལྡོབ] A mildly deviant type of fighting or &quot;punk&quot; monk who engaged in fighting and other unusual behaviors for monks in traditional Tibet&#x27;s large monasteries.">dobdo</a> who didn't have a dagger under his monks lower garment. In the past, I don't remember the year, but on the 1st of the 7th month when the Nyemo Lhamo, [Tib. སྙེ་མོ་ལྷ་མོ] Opera Group was performing at <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. གནས་ཆུང] 1. One of the main protector deities of the Tibetan government and the Dalai Lama. 2. The monastery in which the medium of Nechung resides that is located just east of Drepung Monastery.">Nechung</a> and some dobdo dragged away a performer right from the stage. The shengo knew of this and later expelled them from the association the kyidu. When this happened I don't know. The boy was wearing the mask of hunter, [Tib. རྔོན་པ]. At that time, the sponsor of the Nyemo Lhamo was shatra. [Tib. བཤད་སྒྲ] The mask was sponsored by shatra. I think there were 2 or 3 who were expelled from the tratsang.   

**Q:**  Was he a <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ལྡབ་ལྡོབ] A mildly deviant type of fighting or &quot;punk&quot; monk who engaged in fighting and other unusual behaviors for monks in traditional Tibet&#x27;s large monasteries.">dobdo</a> who snatched away the performer?

**A:**  Although it was not legal, but nobody said anything. For example, nowadays if the Chinese communists heads are always saying that we must expose corruption and bribery, but nevertheless there is no exposure because most of the communist high leaders are doing this by themselves. So if they say a lot to the lower ones, the lower ones will accuse them of doing it. This and drombo situation in old society are the same. From the abbot and shengo down they are all doing this, so they can't say anything about this since they are all doing it.   

**Q:**  Doesn't it break the vows?   

**A:**  Yes it is. But it was uncontrollable. So because the leaders were not clean themselves, the practice was not stopped. The Chinese officials are not to be blamed. One group says Chinese are terrible. But all Chinese are not bad. Even among the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. སྐུ་དྲག] 1. A member of the lay aristocracy. 2. Title for government lay and monk officials. 3. A name occasionally used for the top leaders/officials in a monastery.">kudrak</a> and lamas, there were ones who didn't act morally upright. That was ones own fault, there is nothing to blame the zhongyang. "if you do good work now, you will do well in future life. If you do bad things against the law of cause and effect in this life, you will suffer in this life and in the next." It is similar ot what the Chinese say, "good deeds have good result and the bad deeds havw bad result" [Tib. ལས་ཀ་བཟང་པོ་བྱས་ན་འབྲས་བུ་བཟང་པོ། ལས་ཀ་ངན་པ་བྱས་ན་འབྲས་བུ་ངན་པ] Most Tibetans think about the next life. Let me tell you a saying, "to see the effect of your past lives, look at your present life and to see where would you go in the future, look at your mind in this life" [Tib. སྔ་མ་གང་བྱས་ད་ལྟའི་ལུས་ལ་བལྟོས།ཕྱི་མ་གང་འགྲོ་ད་ལྟའི་སེམས་ལ་བལྟོས] So this view wasn't really being utilized in the monastery.   

**Q:**  Is it considered the same as having sex with women?   

**A:**  No its not. There were no women in the monastery. If a monk secretly slept with women, in a year or two the other monks would find out or something bad will happen.   

**Q:**  What kind of bad thing would happen?   

**A:**  They would get sick, or run away since they knew they had done wrong and feared they would be exposed, or they would be found out and captured or they would become a person who steal things though usually they don't. In general his facial appearance will change.   

**A:**  Yes. If a dog bit a monk, it is said that he lost his celibacy. Trindö says: In Ramoche [Tib. ར་མོ་ཆེ] in the Lama Gyüba custom, if a dog bit a monk he would be expelled saying that he had lost his celibacy.   

**A:**  Yes. If a dog bit a monk, it is said that he lost his celibacy.   

**Q:**  Do you monks in Drepung also have this rule?   

**A:**  Yes.   

**Q:**  T.T: what happens if a dog bit a monk who was celibate?   

**A:**  A dog won't bite a monk if he is celibate. They couldn't stop this because the officials were all doing.   

**Q:**  If a monk have sex with a woman, it is regarded as he lost his celibacy, but if a monk have homosexual with his <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. དགེ་ཕྲུག] 1. Student. 2. Disciple. 3. Commonly the name for monks living with a gegen or teacher. These are more like wards than real disciples.">gidru</a>, this was not regarded as losing the celibacy, right?   

**A:**  Yes.   

**Q:**  They say that is is not good, but they don't lose their celibacy, right?   

**A:**  Yes. They couldn't control it because they were doing it. TT: This is like the saying, " In speech the lama says things, but in deeds, the lama does" [Tib.གསུང་རྒྱུ་བླ་མས་གསུང་ཡོང། མཛད་རྒྱུ་བླ་མས་མཛད་ཡོང]   

**A:**  These things happened because they do not know the principle of the religion though they wear monk's robe and did reckless things. Accept some monks who really have a pure vow, most of the monks were like this.   

**Q:**  What did the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. དགེ་ཕྲུག] 1. Student. 2. Disciple. 3. Commonly the name for monks living with a gegen or teacher. These are more like wards than real disciples.">gidru</a> think and feel or fif they agree to that?

There is another saying of gegen when they are teasing their <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. དགེ་ཕྲུག] 1. Student. 2. Disciple. 3. Commonly the name for monks living with a gegen or teacher. These are more like wards than real disciples.">gidru</a>: The gegen said,"If I fall, where will I fall? I will fall on you. If the sky falls where will it all, it will fall on the floor. Then I will fall on you" [Tib. ང་ཟག་ན་ག་པར་ཟག་གི་རེད། ཁྱོད་རང་སྒང་ལ་ཟག་གི་རེད། གནམ་ཟག་ན་ག་པར་ཟག་གི་རེད། གནམ་ས་མཐིལ་སྒང་ལ་ཟག་གིརེད། འོ་ན་ཟགས་སོང] [laughter]

Jiso nicknamed Takhare [Tib. སྟག་ཁ་རལ] had a group of them.   

**Q:**  TT: Wasn't there a famous drombo of <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. སྒོ་མང] One of the large colleges in Drepung Monastery.">Gomang</a> called Ojo, [Tib. ཨོ་ཇོ]? Which Nyertsang did he stay with?   

**A:**  He didn't stay with a nyertsang. He stayed in Tagtser, [Tib. སྟག་འཚེར] Labrang and even went to China.

If they have problem, the gegen and gidru would get separated. Sometimes they break up and the gidru says after awhile, I won't stay and they divide up the property.

**A:**  No.

**A:**  "Na" must be the name of the position, [Tib. གནས] because only the 4 <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཁང་ཚན] A monastic residential unit in which monks from specific geographic areas lived. These were corporate entities with property and internal officials. Some large khamtsen had smaller subordinate units called mi tshan. Khamtsen were part of tratsang (colleges).

A prayer assembly meeting in monasteries when all the monks come to an assembly hall and chant prayers together.">tshog</a> chöra. Do all of them go to the tshog chöra?   

**A:**  It is said, but not done. When I was the umdze, mostly in the morning session there is karam trekor, [Tib. བཀའ་རམ་གྲལ་སྐོར] karam sarma [Tib. གསར་མ] drekor. That is one group who have to go; then there are a few older monks who are lagyüba. There are only about 30 old monks there which is like one person from one grade. In the afternoon <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཆོས་ར] The special grove (&quot;dharma grove&quot;) in monasteries where monks formally met to practice debating.">chöra</a>, <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཉིན་ཆོས] A mid-day study session in monasteries.">nyinchö</a>, [Tib. ཉིན་ཆོས] there are some more, about 200-300 monks. In Kurim, [Tib. སྐུ་རིམ] there are also about 200-300 monks. But if there is alms and salary then a lot come. When we assemble chöra in <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. སྒོ་མང] One of the large colleges in Drepung Monastery.">Gomang</a>, I feel sad [because there are so few monks]. In fact, the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. སྡེ་ཡངས] One of the colleges in Drepung Monastery.">Deyang</a> Tratsang's chöra is more than ours even though they have much fewer monks than us. My <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. 1. ཤག, 2. ཞག] 1. The apartment/room of a monk. 2. The butter fat that coagulates on the top of butter-tea when the tea is left to sit for some time.

The senior monks are usually served tea with a lot of shag.">shag</a> was near Deyang so I saw. As for the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. གྲྭ་རྒྱུན] Monks who came to Drepung, Ganden and Sera from far distances such as Kham and Amdo.">tragyün</a> they are special in that they start off chöra from the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. འདོན] A volume measurement used for fields on aristocratic and religious manorial estates.

**Q:**  At <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. འཇང་དགུན་ཆོས] The special winter debating session for monks that was held annually in the area called Jang.">Jang günchö</a>, is there any special salary for <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. སྒོ་མང] One of the large colleges in Drepung Monastery.">Gomang</a>?   

**A:**  No extra. They continue to get the monastery's alms and salary and whatever there is at Jayan günchö. The first time they go to <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. འཇང་དགུན་ཆོས] The special winter debating session for monks that was held annually in the area called Jang.">Jang günchö</a>, the abbot of Jang günchö comes around with a tea pot and gives the new monks tea and says from this time [?] on you are under the rules of Ratö [Tib. ར་སྟོད] for one month and the half month and the monks became like they joined Ratö during that time. At Jang günchö there were: <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. བློ་གསལ་གླིང] One of the main colleges in Drepung Monastery.">Loseling</a>, <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. སྡེ་ཡངས] One of the colleges in Drepung Monastery.">Deyang</a>, <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. སྒོ་མང] One of the large colleges in Drepung Monastery.">Gomang</a>, Je and <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. སྨད] The Mey College of Sera Monastery.">Mey</a> and in the past, only Ganden Changtse [Tib. བྱང་རྩེ] was there and Shartse[Tib. ཤར་རྩེ] wasn't at Jang günchö, but they convene at the Sangphu Yarchö [Tib. གསང་ཕུ་དབྱར་ཆོས]. In general,Jang günchö and Sangphu Yarchö were similar to the Lama Gyüba going for the chöthog.   

**Q:**  Trindrö: Wasn't there a saying regarding the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. འཇང་དགུན་ཆོས] The special winter debating session for monks that was held annually in the area called Jang.">Jang günchö</a>, "if people say that I was not at the Sangphu Yarchö, this means thet I am dead and if people say that I was at the Jang günchö, this means that I have got mad." [Tib. འཇང་དགུན་ཆོས་ལ་ང་སླེབས་འདུག་ཟེར་ན། ང་སྨྱོ་པ་རེད། གསང་ཕུ་གྱར་ཆོས་ལ་ང་སླེབས་མི་འདུག་ཟེར་ན་ང་ཤི་བ་རེད]. [laughter] So it seems that it was hard at Jang günchö and it was happy in Sangphu Yarchö, right?   

**A:**  It is hard as there is a lot of debating and tests. You have to stay up late at night and it is very cold each <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. གྲྭ་ཚང] A &quot;college&quot; within a monastery, for example, in Drepung Monastery there were four main tratsang: Gomang, Loseling, Deyang and Ngagpa. These tratsang were property owning corporate entities and included monks who were organized into residential dormitories called Khamtsen.">tratsang</a> also would give you the exams. I went there for one year.   

**Q:**  When you went there how many monks attended?   

**A:**  About 1,000 monks because the assembly hall was full. At the Sangbu Yarchö it is more like a picnic.   

**Q:**  There were the monks from the Sera, Dreping, Ganden and Ratö. Who else were there?   

**A:**  Probably there was Ramey, [Tib. ར་སྨད] also.   

**Q:**  Can you tell about dönsang or kesang, [Tib. སྐད་བཟང]?   

**A:**  Dönsang and kesang mean the same thing, but in <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. སྒོ་མང] One of the large colleges in Drepung Monastery.">Gomang</a> we call it ketre [Tib. སྐད་གྲལ]. In <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. བློ་གསལ་གླིང] One of the main colleges in Drepung Monastery.">Loseling</a>, they call it Dönsang Kesang. They are the same but with different names. Dönsang means you are good in prayers, but do not have a good voice. Kesang means you have a good chanting voice. In Gomang, e.g., we were only allowed to use one's natural voice rangke [Tib. རང་སྐད] and we were not allowed to use <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. མཛོ] A cross between a yak and a cow/ox.">dzo</a> sound, dzoke [Tib. mzo skad] [the deep stylized voice]. Sera has still different names for this [these is an example of these two on the tape]. The <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཚོགས་ཆེན] The main assembly hall of a monastery. The assembly hall for the monastery as a whole.">tsogchen</a> umdze have to use dzoke, but in Gomang we only use natural voice rangke in the tratsang. So when I was the Gomang umdze although I only had to use rangke, I had no choice but to learn dzoke. If you ask why, in Mönlam, [Tib. སྨོན་ལམ] Prayer Festival for 12 days we have to use dzoke.   

**Q:**  How did you learn it?   

**A:**  To learn dzoke you have to look for some young monks who knows the dzoke. In the monastery, there are some youths who know, so you ask them to help and then you go outside the monastery to practice. Sometimes, you have to practice holding your head back and sometimes with your head bent over. That's how one learns. If you don't know dzoke you can not be <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཚོགས་ཆེན] The main assembly hall of a monastery. The assembly hall for the monastery as a whole.">tsogchen</a> umdze so he studied it.   

**Q:**  How do you do this practice from the beginning?   

**A:**  For 6 years, we memorize the prayers of Düdra and we take the exam. In one year there are 8 session, <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཆོས་ཐོག] A monastic &quot;academic semester.&quot; A period of studying/debating in the monastic curriculum that is something like a term or semester. A period of time when monks were engaged in formal studying. There were eight chöthog in a year: the autumn chöthog (tönchö [tib. སྟོན་ཆོས]) was for one month, the summer chöthog (yarchö [tib. དབྱར་ཆོས]) was for one month, the winter chöthog (günchö [tib. དགུན་ཆོས]) was for one month, and the spring chöthog (jichö [tib. དཔྱིད་ཆོས]) was for one month. Then there were also two monthly chöra called dachö [tib. ཟླ་ཆོས] and two 15 day chöra called jönga chöra [tib. བཅོ་ལྔ་ཆོས་ར].">chöthog</a>, [see above] at these times in the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཆོས་ར] The special grove (&quot;dharma grove&quot;) in monasteries where monks formally met to practice debating.">chöra</a>, the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. དགེ་སྐོས] The main disciplinary official in a monastic college (tratsang).">gegö</a> and umdze will test the students. At the monthly chöra called dachö [Tib. ཟླ་ཆོས], there are more days of tests and the 20, nyishu [Tib. ཉི་ཤུ] chöra is less tests and at 15 jönga [Tib. བཅོ་ལྔ] chöra there are the least tests. Then you study <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. བློ་རིགས] The last class/level in the düdra monastic curriculum. This is the end of the phase of memorizing texts.">lurik</a> after this is finished. When you are studying lurik, the umdze does a lot of examining (looking). From among the students doing lurik, the umdze looks them all over and selects the best to act as lurik umdze. This is something you cannot refuse. When they ask you to do lurik umdze, then you are automatically part of dönsang or ketrel group. Then all the moks in the grade would hold an assembly.
