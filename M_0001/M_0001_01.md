**Q:**  Tell us how you first became a monk. Your own experiences.   

**A:**  I became a monk at age 7.   

**Q:**  How many family members did you have?   

**A:**  There were 8-9 persons in my household; grandfather, grandmother and my late mother. At that time, there were not many children.   

**Q:**  Who was your <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. དགེ་རྒན] 1. Teacher in a school. 2. In monastic settings it also refers to an adult monk who acted as a guardian to a younger monk. In such cases, the younger monk typically lived in the gegen&#x27;s apartment (shag). In monasteries, however, it could also mean a real teacher, or the monk who served as the guarantor for a new monk.">gegen</a> (guardian/teacher)?   

**A:**  My <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. དགེ་རྒན] 1. Teacher in a school. 2. In monastic settings it also refers to an adult monk who acted as a guardian to a younger monk. In such cases, the younger monk typically lived in the gegen&#x27;s apartment (shag). In monasteries, however, it could also mean a real teacher, or the monk who served as the guarantor for a new monk.">gegen</a> was my maternal uncle. He died in about 1963. We stayed as a household after 1959 (for awhile) and then I left the monastery.   

**Q:**  How old are you now?   

**A:**  I'm 68 years old. My home was around Trisam [Tib. ཁྲི་ཟམ] near Lhasa. According to our custom, I belonged to Kyormolung [Tib. སྐྱོར་མོ་ལུང] Tratsang, so I <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཞོ] A unit in the traditional Tibetan currency system. 10 sho equaled to 1 sang and 10 karma equaled one sho.">sho</a>uld have first become a monk in Kyormolung Tratsang and then come to Drepung. But I asked Kyormolung for the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཆོས་འཁྲོལ] Official permission from one&#x27;s lord to become a monk/nun. After receiving this, the person&#x27;s obligation to his lord ceased so long as he/she remained a monk or nun. However, should one leave the monastic order, one reverted to original youth status as a subject of the estate/lord.">chödrö</a>. Then I entered directly into Drepung. I had to ask for the chödrö [release from one's lord) or my vows wouldn't have been pure. One has to ask one's parents and one's lord [Tib. དཔོན་པོ] also, otherwise one's vows are not pure. This was a saying in the old society. I had to give 3 sho or 5 sho for the chödrö. From age 7-11, I was a monk in <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. སྒོ་མང] One of the large colleges in Drepung Monastery.">Gomang</a> Tratsang and I studied düdra. There are 6 classes, one each year: <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཁ་དོག་དཀར་དམར] The first class or stage in the monastic düdra curriculum.">khatog garmar</a>, <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. བསྡུས་འབྲིང] The second class in the düdra monastic curriculum.">düdring</a>, <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. བསྡུས་ཆེན] The third class in the düdra monastic curriculum.">düchen</a> , <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. རྟགས་རིགས] The next to last class in the düdra monastic curriculum.">tagrik</a>, <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. བློ་རིགས] The last class/level in the düdra monastic curriculum. This is the end of the phase of memorizing texts.">lurik</a> [These are the classes in düdra]. Every year we stay in one class. There are 8 <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཆོས་ཐོག] A monastic &quot;academic semester.&quot; A period of studying/debating in the monastic curriculum that is something like a term or semester. A period of time when monks were engaged in formal studying. There were eight chöthog in a year: the autumn chöthog (tönchö [tib. སྟོན་ཆོས]) was for one month, the summer chöthog (yarchö [tib. དབྱར་ཆོས]) was for one month, the winter chöthog (günchö [tib. དགུན་ཆོས]) was for one month, and the spring chöthog (jichö [tib. དཔྱིད་ཆོས]) was for one month. Then there were also two monthly chöra called dachö [tib. ཟླ་ཆོས] and two 15 day chöra called jönga chöra [tib. བཅོ་ལྔ་ཆོས་ར].">chöthog</a> in a year: some are monthly, dachö [Tib. ཟླ་ཆོས], some <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཆོས་ར] The special grove (&quot;dharma grove&quot;) in monasteries where monks formally met to practice debating.">chöra</a> are on the 20th (nyishu [Tib. ཉི་ཤུ]), and some chöra are on the 15th (Tib. jönga [Tib. བཅོ་ལྔ]). Based on these semesters, we take the exams before the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. གྲྭ་ཚང] A &quot;college&quot; within a monastery, for example, in Drepung Monastery there were four main tratsang: Gomang, Loseling, Deyang and Ngagpa. These tratsang were property owning corporate entities and included monks who were organized into residential dormitories called Khamtsen.">tratsang</a> uchö. We take the exams during a meeting.   

**Q:**  Are these studied before the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. མཚན་ཉིད] Buddhist dialectics. This is taught after the six-year curriculum called düdra.">tsenyi</a> starts?   

**A:**  These are not tsenyi. After the 6 years of the (initial düdra) classes, then you have to start once again in class one with <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཁ་དོག་དཀར་དམར] The first class or stage in the monastic düdra curriculum.">khatog garmar</a> while studying tsenyi.   

**Q:**  Do you have to learn by heart the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཁ་དོག་དཀར་དམར] The first class or stage in the monastic düdra curriculum.">khatog garmar</a>?   

**Q:**  These are the names of the classes like <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. བསྡུས་འབྲིང] The second class in the düdra monastic curriculum.">düdring</a> and <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. བསྡུས་ཆེན] The third class in the düdra monastic curriculum.">düchen</a> in the düdra. When you start learning <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. རྟགས་རིགས] The next to last class in the düdra monastic curriculum.">tagrik</a> and <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. བློ་རིགས] The last class/level in the düdra monastic curriculum. This is the end of the phase of memorizing texts.">lurik</a>, then you start debating. After we have memorized the prayers recited in <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཚོགས] 1. A prayer assembly meeting in monasteries when all the monks come to an assembly hall and chant prayers together. 2. An offering made of tsamba, butter and dry cheese in the shape of a cone.">tsog</a> and after one has finished lurik, then the exam is passed. Then we collect donations and there is a special prayer assembly (tsog) that is done at the end of lurik called lurik düsang [Tib. དུས་བཟང]. For this, the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. གྲྭ་ཚང] A &quot;college&quot; within a monastery, for example, in Drepung Monastery there were four main tratsang: Gomang, Loseling, Deyang and Ngagpa. These tratsang were property owning corporate entities and included monks who were organized into residential dormitories called Khamtsen.">tratsang</a> gegö and umdze would investigate and appoint an umdze from among the those boys with the best voices. There were some monks who are called dönsangnga [Tib. འདོན་བཟང་བ] who had their own organization to learn the prayer chantings of the tratsang. And in <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. སྒོ་མང] One of the large colleges in Drepung Monastery.">Gomang</a> they sit in the prayer assembly meetings on the left and right sides of the front row. On the 24-25th of the 7th Tibetan month, the dönsangnga would assemble for one week.   

**Q:**  When you first came into the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. 1. ཤག, 2. ཞག] 1. The apartment/room of a monk. 2. The butter fat that coagulates on the top of butter-tea when the tea is left to sit for some time. If the tea had been made with a lot of butter, this layer could be thick enough to scoop off and save to later sell or eat separately. The senior monks are usually served tea with a lot of shag.">shag</a> how many <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. དགེ་ཕྲུག] 1. Student. 2. Disciple. 3. Commonly the name for monks living with a gegen or teacher. These are more like wards than real disciples.">gidru</a> were there?   

**A:**  Just me.   

**Q:**  Did your parents want you to join or did maternal uncle ask you to?   

**A:**  No. I asked myself, I wanted to be a monk like my uncle. So they made me a monk and I became the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. དགེ་ཕྲུག] 1. Student. 2. Disciple. 3. Commonly the name for monks living with a gegen or teacher. These are more like wards than real disciples.">gidru</a> of my maternal uncle.   

**Q:**  Did you know how to write before you entered the monastery?   

**A:**  No. My <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. དགེ་རྒན] 1. Teacher in a school. 2. In monastic settings it also refers to an adult monk who acted as a guardian to a younger monk. In such cases, the younger monk typically lived in the gegen&#x27;s apartment (shag). In monasteries, however, it could also mean a real teacher, or the monk who served as the guarantor for a new monk.">gegen</a> found me a pechai gegan. My gegen, in order to make me learn better, sent <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. རྩམ་པ] The traditional Tibetan staple food that consists of grain that is roasted (popped), usually in heated sand, and then ground into a flour.">tsamba</a> and tea and had me live with my pechai gegan so I couldn't wander around. In that way I memorized all the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. གྲྭ་ཚང] A &quot;college&quot; within a monastery, for example, in Drepung Monastery there were four main tratsang: Gomang, Loseling, Deyang and Ngagpa. These tratsang were property owning corporate entities and included monks who were organized into residential dormitories called Khamtsen.">tratsang</a>'s prayers recited in the assembly [Tib. འདོན་ཆོས].   

**Q:**  How did you learn to write and read?   

**A:**  There was no school in the monastery teaching the written form of the alphabet [Tib. དབུ་མེད]. My <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. དགེ་རྒན] 1. Teacher in a school. 2. In monastic settings it also refers to an adult monk who acted as a guardian to a younger monk. In such cases, the younger monk typically lived in the gegen&#x27;s apartment (shag). In monasteries, however, it could also mean a real teacher, or the monk who served as the guarantor for a new monk.">gegen</a> had 3-4 other students. Two of us lived with the pechai gegan (one was his <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. དགེ་ཕྲུག] 1. Student. 2. Disciple. 3. Commonly the name for monks living with a gegen or teacher. These are more like wards than real disciples.">gidru</a>) and later the other gidru, called Gendün Tashi [Tib. དགེ་འདུན་བཀྲ་ཤིས], didn't stay in Drepung and went to <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཆུ་ཤུར] The name of a town, district and county at the confluence of the Lhasa and Tsangpo Rivers.">Chushü</a> Kharag [Tib. ཆུ་ཤུར་ཁ་རག྄] and became a monk in the Büde Gomchen [Tib. སྦུད་བདེ་སྒོམ་ཆེན]. I didn't meet him later. There was another one who would come in the morning and leave in the evening.   

**Q:**  What was your <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. གྲྭ་ཚང] A &quot;college&quot; within a monastery, for example, in Drepung Monastery there were four main tratsang: Gomang, Loseling, Deyang and Ngagpa. These tratsang were property owning corporate entities and included monks who were organized into residential dormitories called Khamtsen.">tratsang</a>?   

**A:**  I was in <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. སྒོ་མང] One of the large colleges in Drepung Monastery.">Gomang</a> and within that in Hamdong [Tib. ཧར་གདོང] Khamtsen and my <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. མི་ཚན] A sub-unit of a khamtsen.">mitsen</a> was Hor.   

**Q:**  Did you have to do the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. གཞོན་ཁྲལ] The work obligations all young monks have to do for the monastery (it literally means &quot;youth tax&quot;).">shöndre</a>?   

**A:**  Yes. I have to do the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. གཞོན་ཁྲལ] The work obligations all young monks have to do for the monastery (it literally means &quot;youth tax&quot;).">shöndre</a> in the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཁང་ཚན] A monastic residential unit in which monks from specific geographic areas lived. These were corporate entities with property and internal officials. Some large khamtsen had smaller subordinate units called mi tshan. Khamtsen were part of tratsang (colleges). For example, Hamdong Khamtsen was part of Gomang College in Drepung Monastery.">khamtsen</a> and the mitsen. Later, just before the revolt I wasn't in the order of Drepung because I was [expelled], because I was jailed. The poor monks criticized me because I was the umdze. But I said I was from the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. དབུལ་ཕོངས] The communist term for the &quot;poor&quot; class.">üpong</a> class. I had been promoted step by step through doing all the shöndre and became the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. གྲྭ་ཚང] A &quot;college&quot; within a monastery, for example, in Drepung Monastery there were four main tratsang: Gomang, Loseling, Deyang and Ngagpa. These tratsang were property owning corporate entities and included monks who were organized into residential dormitories called Khamtsen.">tratsang</a> umdze and you are saying I am trerim. At that time, all of the monks who are üpong also hoped some day that they could become a monastic official.   

**Q:**  Was your <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. དགེ་རྒན] 1. Teacher in a school. 2. In monastic settings it also refers to an adult monk who acted as a guardian to a younger monk. In such cases, the younger monk typically lived in the gegen&#x27;s apartment (shag). In monasteries, however, it could also mean a real teacher, or the monk who served as the guarantor for a new monk.">gegen</a> a <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. དཔེ་ཆ་བ] A monk studying the monastic philosophical curriculum. A scholar monk.">pechawa</a>?   

**A:**  No he wasn't. I studied <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. མཚན་ཉིད] Buddhist dialectics. This is taught after the six-year curriculum called düdra.">tsenyi</a> for awhile and went to <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. འཇང] 1. The area called Jang. 2. The special winter debating session for monks that was held annually in Jang.">Jang</a> Günchö, but I wasn't able to do keep on doing that because in the Iron-Tiger or Iron-Hare Year the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཚོགས་ཆེན] The main assembly hall of a monastery. The assembly hall for the monastery as a whole.">tsogchen</a> umdze died. Then the umdze of <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. སྒོ་མང] One of the large colleges in Drepung Monastery.">Gomang</a> Tratsang got appointed as the umdze of the tsogchen. Then in the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. གྲྭ་ཚང] A &quot;college&quot; within a monastery, for example, in Drepung Monastery there were four main tratsang: Gomang, Loseling, Deyang and Ngagpa. These tratsang were property owning corporate entities and included monks who were organized into residential dormitories called Khamtsen.">tratsang</a>, there were about 30 odd youths from the dönsannga who had good voices and they had a competition of their voices. One day, the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཕྱག་སྦུག] A manager (of estates and endowments) of a monastic college or monastic khamtsen.">chabu</a>, abbot, <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. དགེ་སྐོས] The main disciplinary official in a monastic college (tratsang).">gegö</a> and umdze came and we had a voice competition three times. In the end, there were three left as the final contenders for the tratsang umdze post. Then they did the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཟན་རིལ] A divine lottery. Multiple answers to a question were written on paper of the same size and rolled in dough balls of the same size and weight. These were shaken in a plate or bowl in front of a statue of a deity until one of the balls popped out. The ball that popped out was considered to have been selected by the deity before which the lottery was done.">senriy</a> and rolled the three names in front of the protector deity Maha Kala, Gönpo [Tib. མགོན་པོ] and I was selected. I was 28 years old at that time. If I hadn't been selected umdze, I would have continued to study as a <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. དཔེ་ཆ་བ] A monk studying the monastic philosophical curriculum. A scholar monk.">pechawa</a>, but once I was umdze, I couldn't study <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. དཔེ་ཆ] Religious books/texts, scriptures.">pecha</a> anymore. The post of umdze needs someone with a good voice and a large body. I did this until 1958. In the past in Gomang there were many students and <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. དགེ་ཤེས] An advanced degree earned by scholar monks.">geshe</a> studying tsenyi and people say that Gomang Tratsang was the source of many scholars. During the 6 year term of each abbot it was expected that there would be 60 geshe graduates. But in recent times, only 2, 3, or 4 graduated. Because of this, the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. རྩེ་འགག] The Secretariat Office of the Dalai Lama.">tse ga</a> called us and asked why there were just a few geshe in Drepung where in the past the were so many geshe. Later when we examined this, we found that there were many geshe, but they had not completed their education in all the five main tsenyi texts [Tib. གཞུང་པུ་ཏི་ལྔ] like didn't learn the dzö [Tib. མཛོད] and düwa [Tib. འདུལ་བ]. Therefore, the number of the new students learning tsenyi and the number of the passing geshe was unbalanced. So we thought this is not good and has to be changed. In general, there were over 4,000 monks in Gomang, but in the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཆོས་ར] The special grove (&quot;dharma grove&quot;) in monasteries where monks formally met to practice debating.">chöra</a>, there were only 100-200 monks. The rest just took the name of the monk, but was wearing the mask of religion [Tib. ཆོས་འབག་གོན] but we didn't notice it. Actually, the discipline and the structure in Gomang was good; there was the laji and chabu and the 14 members of the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཚོགས་འདུ] 1. The general name for the various types of Tibetan government assemblies. 2. Any assembly, e.g., the assembly (meeting) of monks in a college.">tsondu</a> and there were the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཁང་ཚན] A monastic residential unit in which monks from specific geographic areas lived. These were corporate entities with property and internal officials. Some large khamtsen had smaller subordinate units called mi tshan. Khamtsen were part of tratsang (colleges). For example, Hamdong Khamtsen was part of Gomang College in Drepung Monastery.">khamtsen</a> and the mitsen. But the number of geshe was declining. So we got the idea that we have to do something to reverse this trend. There was a danger in the future that the people might ask who were the monastic officials then. So we thought we must do something. The government's salary to the monks used to be distributed in the chöra. And monks, even those aged 75 to 80 used to come to the chöra to collect their salary. But these monks don't know their grade [Tib. འཛིན་གྲྭ] - they didn't even know which grade to sit in since they came so infrequently. So some of us thought that we should start paying the tratsang salary in the chöra and we started to discuss this among ourselves. Then they started this practice and did it once. We thought that if we pay salary in the chöra, more monks would come to the chöra.   

**Q:**  What is the difference if you paid the salary in the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཆོས་ར] The special grove (&quot;dharma grove&quot;) in monasteries where monks formally met to practice debating.">chöra</a>?   

**A:**  If we paid the salary in the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཆོས་ར] The special grove (&quot;dharma grove&quot;) in monasteries where monks formally met to practice debating.">chöra</a>, with the exception of the ones with special privileges, all will come to the chöra and the assembly in the chöra will become big. We wouldn't have to say come specially to study <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. དཔེ་ཆ] Religious books/texts, scriptures.">pecha</a> but just by coming 2, 3, 4, or 5 times they will get into the habit of learning pecha. But later it didn't work out.   

**Q:**  What kind of salary was paid by Tibetan Government?   

**A:**  It was paid in money in the chöra.   

**Q:**  Was there a fixed amount?   

**A:**  No. This was just the left over from performing the rituals. We got this idea [to pay the <a href "#" data-tooltip "[tib. གྲྭ་ཚང] A &quot;college&quot; within a monastery, for example, in Drepung Monastery there were four main tratsang: Gomang, Loseling, Deyang and Ngagpa. These tratsang were property owning corporate entities and included monks who were organized into residential dormitories called Khamtsen.">tratsang</a>=salary=in=the=chöra], in the past the tratsang salary was paid in the area near the main gate [Tib. སྒོ་མཆོར], but later trouble occurred over it and two ideologies [Tib. ལྟ་བ] developed.   

**Q:**  After you got the idea, how did you go about doing it? Did you ask the abbot?   

**A:**  We asked the abbot and the 16 <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཁང་ཚན] A monastic residential unit in which monks from specific geographic areas lived. These were corporate entities with property and internal officials. Some large khamtsen had smaller subordinate units called mi tshan. Khamtsen were part of tratsang (colleges). For example, Hamdong Khamtsen was part of Gomang College in Drepung Monastery.">khamtsen</a> (under <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. སྒོ་མང] One of the large colleges in Drepung Monastery.">Gomang</a> tratsang).   

**Q:**  Who was the abbot then?   

**A:**  First the abbot was Chömphel Jamyang [Tib. ཆོས་འཕེལ་འཇམ་དབྱངས] then at the time of the trouble it was Kelsang Lengden [Tib. སྐལ་བཟང་ལེགས་ལྡན]. It was in 1958.   

**Q:**  What did the abbot say?   

**A:**  He said it was a good idea and agreed. The other main supporters were the abbots' <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཕྱག་མཛོད] A senior manager/treasurer of an aristocratic or monastic estate, or the senior manager/treasurer of an aristocratic family or a monastic unit. Generally chandzö handled both internal and external issues and were considered higher in power and status than nyerpa (stewards), who typically only handled the storerooms.">chandzö</a>, the senior, Samlo Drepa [Tib. བསམ་ལྷོ་བགྲེས་པ] the Karam [Tib. བཀའ་རམ] <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. སྐྱོར་དཔོན] The monastic official who functions as the main teacher in the Dharma Grove (chöra) where monks go to study debating and logic.">gyorpön</a> and an <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཨ་མདོ] One of the three main Tibetan sub-ethnic areas. It is located in the northeast of the Tibetan Plateau mostly in today&#x27;s Qinghai Province. A person from Amdo is called an Amdowa.">Amdo</a> pechawa and me. These were the main ring leaders [Tib. གཏེ་པོ]. The Samlo Drepa was in the same <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. 1. ཤག, 2. ཞག] 1. The apartment/room of a monk. 2. The butter fat that coagulates on the top of butter-tea when the tea is left to sit for some time. If the tea had been made with a lot of butter, this layer could be thick enough to scoop off and save to later sell or eat separately. The senior monks are usually served tea with a lot of shag.">shag</a> as the abbot. Our plan was to make more pechawa. For example, the custom is to have 60 <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. དགེ་ཤེས] An advanced degree earned by scholar monks.">geshe</a> passed during each abbot's 6-year term, but even if we got 30-40 it would be okay. However, we were having only 1-2-3 geshe a year. At this rate, it looked like the geshe would definitely become finished. The abbot was the main one who tried to do something, but it didn't work.   

**Q:**  How many monks came to <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. མང་ཇ] The morning tea served to monks from all the monastic colleges at the main prayer assembly hall.">mangja</a>?   

**A:**  Maybe 300-400 monks on the regular four mangja.   

**Q:**  Who first came up with the idea. Was it you?   

**A:**  We were the ones who started.   

**Q:**  How many people were there?   

**A:**  This was backed by the majority of the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. དཔེ་ཆ་བ] A monk studying the monastic philosophical curriculum. A scholar monk.">pechawa</a>. At that time, the pechawa and the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. བླ་རྒྱུད་པ] A term for the common monks in a monastery (in contrast to the scholar monks who were actively studying the Buddhist doctrine).">lagyüba</a> became two sides. Our idea was supposed to be the idea of the tratsang.   

**Q:**  When you asked the abbot, your idea became the same, right?   

**A:**  Yes.   

**Q:**  According to the monastery's charter [Tib. སྒྲིག་གཞི], after asking the abbot, then to whom do you have to ask?   

**A:**  Our first strategy was to ask the abbot whether he agreed and he did. Then we asked the Dalai Lama for the divination regarding whether it was good to pay the salary in the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཆོས་ར] The special grove (&quot;dharma grove&quot;) in monasteries where monks formally met to practice debating.">chöra</a>. Then the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. བླ་རྒྱུད་པ] A term for the common monks in a monastery (in contrast to the scholar monks who were actively studying the Buddhist doctrine).">lagyüba</a> said we won't agree and we won't accept this because this is a new rule that we didn't have in the past [Tib. སྔར་མེད་གསར་སྤྲོས]. And then the trouble got worse. There was an office in charge of performing additional rituals in the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཇོ་ཁང] A most famous temple in Lhasa that houses a holy statue of the Buddha. It is often used to mean the Tsuglagang Temple of which it is a part.">Jokhang</a>, I am not sure but it was probably called Nangsi Shaphar Lekhung [Tib. སྣང་སྲིད་ཞབས་འཕར་ལས་ཁུངས]. They came as mediators. At this time, we thought the mediators were not in favor of paying salary in the chöra, so we didn't accept their mediation. Then the monks made an commotion and beat us up and then we were called to the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. རྩེ་འགག] The Secretariat Office of the Dalai Lama.">tse ga</a> in <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ནོར་བུ་གླིང་ཁ] The summer palace of the Dalai Lama.">Norbulinga</a> and about 30 some lagyüba were expelled and I [I was umdze] and the abbot's' <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཕྱག་མཛོད] A senior manager/treasurer of an aristocratic or monastic estate, or the senior manager/treasurer of an aristocratic family or a monastic unit.

It is located in the northeast of the Tibetan Plateau mostly in today&#x27;s Qinghai Province. A person from Amdo is called an Amdowa.">Amdo</a> and the Samlo Dreba and another <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. དཔེ་ཆ་བ] A monk studying the monastic philosophical curriculum. A scholar monk.">pechawa</a> were beaten by the monks.   

**Q:**  How did this happen? Were those <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ལྡབ་ལྡོབ] A mildly deviant type of fighting or &quot;punk&quot; monk who engaged in fighting and other unusual behaviors for monks in traditional Tibet&#x27;s large monasteries.">dobdo</a> who beat you?   

**A:**  We got a message from the chabri saying come to a <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. གྲྭ་ཚང] A &quot;college&quot; within a monastery, for example, in Drepung Monastery there were four main tratsang: Gomang, Loseling, Deyang and Ngagpa. These tratsang were property owning corporate entities and included monks who were organized into residential dormitories called Khamtsen.">tratsang</a> tsondu. We went and the monks and <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ལྡབ་ལྡོབ] A mildly deviant type of fighting or &quot;punk&quot; monk who engaged in fighting and other unusual behaviors for monks in traditional Tibet&#x27;s large monasteries.">dobdo</a> were waiting there and they pretended to report the matter. Then they tied us to pillars and beat us. This was my first <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཐམཛིང་ཙོནདུ (འཐབ་འཛིང་ཚོགས་འདུ); ch. 斗争会] Public accusation meetings at which the masses criticized and attacked (struggled against) class enemies and reactionaries, etcetera. Typically, the object of a struggle session would stand in front of the meeting bent over at the waist while the masses questioned and criticized, and often beat him/her.">struggle session</a> [laughter]. This was in 1958.   

**Q:**  Was there any discussion before the beating?   

**A:**  No none. It was really a struggle session. There were about 30-40 <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ལྡབ་ལྡོབ] A mildly deviant type of fighting or &quot;punk&quot; monk who engaged in fighting and other unusual behaviors for monks in traditional Tibet&#x27;s large monasteries.">dobdo</a> in front who grabbed us. At this time, we didn't have any idea who was backing the dobdo from behind the scene. After the revolt, in jail, we found out it was Thubten Tserin [Tib. ཐུབ་བསྟན་ཚེ་རིང] the ex-abbot of Düwa [Tib. འདུལ་བ] and Takhare, the Jiso. Later they confessed that they stirred up the dobdo.   

**Q:**  Did the 14 members of the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. གྲྭ་ཚང] A &quot;college&quot; within a monastery, for example, in Drepung Monastery there were four main tratsang: Gomang, Loseling, Deyang and Ngagpa. These tratsang were property owning corporate entities and included monks who were organized into residential dormitories called Khamtsen.">tratsang</a> tsondu have any discussions? How many meetings did they hold?   

**A:**  No discussions. They only had one meeting but it was of no benefit because most people in the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཚོགས་འདུ] 1. The general name for the various types of Tibetan government assemblies. 2. Any assembly, e.g., the assembly (meeting) of monks in a college.">tsondu</a> were on the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. བླ་རྒྱུད་པ] A term for the common monks in a monastery (in contrast to the scholar monks who were actively studying the Buddhist doctrine).">lagyüba</a>'s side.   

**Q:**  Who had the authority change the salary distribution?   

**A:**  The abbot. But in the 14 <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཚོགས་འདུ] 1. The general name for the various types of Tibetan government assemblies. 2. Any assembly, e.g., the assembly (meeting) of monks in a college.">tsondu</a> members there were more lagyüba. On our side there were the abbot's <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཕྱག་མཛོད] A senior manager/treasurer of an aristocratic or monastic estate, or the senior manager/treasurer of an aristocratic family or a monastic unit. Generally chandzö handled both internal and external issues and were considered higher in power and status than nyerpa (stewards), who typically only handled the storerooms.">chandzö</a> and the Samlo Drepa who both were in the abbot's shagtsang. That's why they were expelled. Nothing happened to the abbot.   

**Q:**  Did the abbot say that you have to do that?   

**A:**  Yes. And after that the laji also talked in between, but they didn't listen to it.   

**Q:**  When the abbot said that the salary should be given in the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཆོས་ར] The special grove (&quot;dharma grove&quot;) in monasteries where monks formally met to practice debating.">chöra</a>, the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. བླ་རྒྱུད་པ] A term for the common monks in a monastery (in contrast to the scholar monks who were actively studying the Buddhist doctrine).">lagyüba</a> didn't listen, right?   

**A:**  Yes. In essence, the abbot's order was not accepted by the lagyüba. They said, "You have made a new rule which didn't exsist in the past."   

**Q:**  Did you submit a petition to the Dalai Lama?   

**A:**  We submited the request for the divination.   

**Q:**  How did you ask for the divination?   

**A:**  We asked the Dalai Lama for divination saying the Tratsang's studies are declining, the government salary is paying in the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཆོས་ར] The special grove (&quot;dharma grove&quot;) in monasteries where monks formally met to practice debating.">chöra</a> and there is a big gathering of monks, so please do the divination, and whether it is good or not to pay the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. གྲྭ་ཚང] A &quot;college&quot; within a monastery, for example, in Drepung Monastery there were four main tratsang: Gomang, Loseling, Deyang and Ngagpa. These tratsang were property owning corporate entities and included monks who were organized into residential dormitories called Khamtsen.">tratsang</a> salary in the chöra? He answered it is good to do it in chöra. Because of this divination, we didn't listen to the mediation.   

**Q:**  Who asked for the divination?   

**Q:**  We, the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. དཔེ་ཆ་བ] A monk studying the monastic philosophical curriculum. A scholar monk.">pechawa</a>, asked for the divination.   

**Q:**  Did you go to the Potala?   

**A:**  We asked via Kündeling Dzasa Wöser Gyentsen [Tib. ཀུན་བདེ་གླིང་འོད་ཟེར་རྒྱལ་མཚན].   

**Q:**  He was part of your group?   

**A:**  Yes. Things weren't settled until the 16th of the 12th lunar month when the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. དཔེ་ཆ་བ] A monk studying the monastic philosophical curriculum. A scholar monk.">pechawa</a> returned. The pechawa left for <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. འཇང] 1. The area called Jang. 2. The special winter debating session for monks that was held annually in Jang.">Jang</a> Günchö on the 1st of the 11th month. They returned on the 16th of the 12th month. The pechawa thought that they should not go to Jang Günchö because if they went, the remaining pechawa might have problems. But the umdze said you must go. Otherwise there will be one problem put on top of another. It's better if you go. The <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. བླ་རྒྱུད་པ] A term for the common monks in a monastery (in contrast to the scholar monks who were actively studying the Buddhist doctrine).">lagyüba</a> knew that most of the pechawa were at Jang Günchö and it was this time that they started beating pechawa. Now in retrospect, I think that was the correct decision. The reason for this is that because most of the pechawa had gone to Jang Günchö, the lagyüba were able to beat a few of us, but if the mass of the pechawa were there, then two large groups would have confronted each other and there would have been a big fight. This didn't happen.   

**Q:**  When did you ask the Dalai Lama for the divination? Did the Nangsi Ritual Office do the mediation in Lhasa or in Drepung?   

**A:**  It was in Lhasa.   

**Q:**  Did you attend this meeting?   

**A:**  Yes.   

**Q:**  What can you tell us about it?   

**A:**  I can't say much about it.   

**Q:**  Who was the main leader of the Nangsi Ritual Office?   

**A:**  The main person was <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. དྲུང་ཡིག་ཆེན་མོ] The title of the four heads of the Yigtsang office (Ecclesiastic Office).">Trunyichemmo</a> Bumthang [Tib. འབུམ་ཐང]. It was held in the Khamsum [Tib. ཁམས་གསུམ] where there were many people. At that time, it was kind of a chaotic situation and I didn't see well.   

**Q:**  Did the representatives of both sides have to talk?   

**A:**  No we didn't have to. The officials announced the written mediation decision, dumtra [Tib. འདུམ་ཁྲ], to us. We refused to accept this mediation.   

**Q:**  Did the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. བླ་རྒྱུད་པ] A term for the common monks in a monastery (in contrast to the scholar monks who were actively studying the Buddhist doctrine).">lagyüba</a> accept this?   

**A:**  It seemed that they kind of accepted it.   

**Q:**  What was in the dumtra?   

**A:**  I don't remember exactly but it was unfavorable to us. It said that the salary should not be paid in the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཆོས་ར] The special grove (&quot;dharma grove&quot;) in monasteries where monks formally met to practice debating.">chöra</a> so we didn't accept it. The Nangsi Office also gave the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. དཔེ་ཆ་བ] A monk studying the monastic philosophical curriculum. A scholar monk.">pechawa</a> some money. The other side didn't get any money. It is a custom for the mediator to do this. I don't remember this too well. Since we didnt accept the mediation I didn't pay too much attention to it. It has been about 40 years.   

**Q:**  Did they beat you when they beat the other people in <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. སྒོ་མང] One of the large colleges in Drepung Monastery.">Gomang</a>?   

**A:**  Yes, not too badly. They tied us to a pillar a little bit and they also searched our pouches of the robe, but I had nothing because being a monk we are not allowed to do reckless things. I heard that they [lagyüba] themselves had guns and the guns fell out in the kitchen.   

**Q:**  Who was the ring leader of <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. བླ་རྒྱུད་པ] A term for the common monks in a monastery (in contrast to the scholar monks who were actively studying the Buddhist doctrine).">lagyüba</a>?   

**A:**  The one now living in Sera called Wöser Chökyong [Tib. འོད་ཟེར་ཆོས་སྐྱོང]   

**Q:**  Was the Dalai Lama's divination done before they issued mediation document?   

**A:**  It was after the Dalai Lama's divination, so we started insisting on paying the salary to the chöra. That is why we refused to accept when the laji called and said something when the Nangsi Office did the mediation.   

**Q:**  What did the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. བླ་རྒྱུད་པ] A term for the common monks in a monastery (in contrast to the scholar monks who were actively studying the Buddhist doctrine).">lagyüba</a> say about the Dalai lama's divination when they refused to accept that?   

**A:**  They said, "Actually they didn't ask for the divination and they just made it up." Out of 4,000 monks in <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. སྒོ་མང] One of the large colleges in Drepung Monastery.">Gomang</a>, in reality there were only about 400 true students of pecha.   

**Q:**  What did the rest of the monks do?   

**A:**  They were doing farming, business and stealing. That's what they really did. At this time, some monks went to <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. མཚོ་སྣ] A district in southern Tibet.">Tsöna</a> [Tib. མཚོ་སྣ] and India to trade and became bankrupted in business so they stole things and they were caught and beaten in jail. Then they quietly came back to the monastery and acted like regular monks. These kinds of behavior are called "wearing a religious mask", chöbagön [Tib. ཆོས་འབག་གོན] but after the revolt the Communist Party put the religious mask on us and we wore it. Whatever work you do, you have to do it truthfully. These kinds of behavior will get their accounting like the saying in the old society, "the Lord of Death is more ferocious than this <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. དཔོན་པོ, མངའ་བདག] 1. A manorial estate holder. 2. Chief of an area.">lord</a> and the future life is much longer than the present life" [Tib. དཔོན་འདི་ལས་ཆོས་རྒྱལ་འཇིགས་སྐྲག་ཆེ། ཚེ་འདི་ལས་གཏིང་མ་ཤུལ་ཐག་རིང]. Everybody has to go through this. If you don't be careful and say that one is great, there will be a problem.   

**Q:**  What would be the sense of making <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ལྡབ་ལྡོབ] A mildly deviant type of fighting or &quot;punk&quot; monk who engaged in fighting and other unusual behaviors for monks in traditional Tibet&#x27;s large monasteries.">dobdo</a> sit in the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཆོས་ར] The special grove (&quot;dharma grove&quot;) in monasteries where monks formally met to practice debating.">chöra</a>? They won't learn anything; why not just pay the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. དཔེ་ཆ་བ] A monk studying the monastic philosophical curriculum. A scholar monk.">pechawa</a> more special salary?   

**A:**  That would have resulted in more <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. དཔེ་ཆ་བ] A monk studying the monastic philosophical curriculum. A scholar monk.">pechawa</a>, but if we did this it would have caused even more comments [Tib. ལྟ་སྟངས]. It will be quite hard for us to do that. If we paid the pechawa more salary, the problems would have increased because everyone said that all the monks are equal. If we did this, it would have been good and would have resulted in more pechawa, but the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. བླ་རྒྱུད་པ] A term for the common monks in a monastery (in contrast to the scholar monks who were actively studying the Buddhist doctrine).">lagyüba</a> would have said all monks are equal and now you are making distinctions among the monks. Secondly,if we were to pay this kind of money, we have no capital for this, so the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. གྲྭ་ཚང] A &quot;college&quot; within a monastery, for example, in Drepung Monastery there were four main tratsang: Gomang, Loseling, Deyang and Ngagpa. These tratsang were property owning corporate entities and included monks who were organized into residential dormitories called Khamtsen.">tratsang</a> <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཕྱག་སྦུག] A manager (of estates and endowments) of a monastic college or monastic khamtsen.">chabu</a> would have to pay it. However, the chabu and lagyüba had the same way of thinking of this, like the proverb, "the disease caused by the same devil" [Tib. གདོན་གཅིག་ཟིན་གྱི་ན་ཚ]. So there was no way for this to occur. Mainly the Labrang (the abbot) had saved up money and gave us a little bit from time to time and we, the uchö also did like that and gave a little bit money like 1-2 <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. སྲང] A unit of traditional Tibetan currency. It was also called ngüsang [tib. དངུལ་སྲང]. 50 nügsang = 1 dotse; 10 sho = 1 nügsang; 20 5-karma coins = 1 ngüsang. There were also paper currency notes of 7-sang, 25-sang, and 10-sang denominations.">sang</a> or 5 <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཞོ] A unit in the traditional Tibetan currency system. 10 sho equaled to 1 sang and 10 karma equaled one sho.">sho</a> on the chöra. Even for this, the lagyüba made a little comment. In reality, if you are a monk, then you should study <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. མཚན་ཉིད] Buddhist dialectics. This is taught after the six-year curriculum called düdra.">tsenyi</a>, if not you will not be regarded as a monk. But they say that they want money even it is one <a href="#" data-tooltip="[ch. 分] 1/100th of a yuan; one cent.">fen</a> and they don't want to work. At this time, we didn't say a word about paying pechawa more money since this would have been considered making distinctions among monks though it would been good in the long run future. But later, after they threw us out of the monastery, the Tibetan Government gave 4-5,000 <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. རྡོ་ཚད] A currency unit in traditional Tibet that was equal to 50 ngüsang.">dotse</a> as capital to <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. སྒོ་མང] One of the large colleges in Drepung Monastery.">Gomang</a> (for this) to be given to the chöra. A special cashier, <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. དངུལ་གཉེར] Accountant, bookkeeper, cashier. Someone in charge of cash.">ngünyer</a> [Tib. dgnul gnyer] was appointed to handle this money to give additional income to help the pechawa. We never got any of it.   

**Q:**  This was like an endowment [Tib. མ་རྩ] for the livelihood supplement [Tib. འཚོ་སྣོན] of the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. དཔེ་ཆ་བ] A monk studying the monastic philosophical curriculum. A scholar monk.">pechawa</a>, right?   

**A:**  Yes.   

**Q:**  Was this for the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. འཇང་དགུན་ཆོས] The special winter debating session for monks that was held annually in the area called Jang.">Jang günchö</a>?   

**A:**  No. It was for the chöra.   

**Q:**  Did they beat you by hand or stick?   

**A:**  They beat us with switches [Tib. རྒྱུག་པ་ཕྲ་པོ].   

**Q:**  How did they catch you?   

**A:**  They held the meeting, then they grabbed us and tied us to the pillar. They tied up the Samlo Drepa, the Labrang's <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཕྱག་མཛོད] A senior manager/treasurer of an aristocratic or monastic estate, or the senior manager/treasurer of an aristocratic family or a monastic unit. Generally chandzö handled both internal and external issues and were considered higher in power and status than nyerpa (stewards), who typically only handled the storerooms.">chandzö</a>, the an <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཨ་མདོ] One of the three main Tibetan sub-ethnic areas. It is located in the northeast of the Tibetan Plateau mostly in today&#x27;s Qinghai Province. A person from Amdo is called an Amdowa.">Amdo</a> monk from the Shungba [Tib. གཞུང་པ] who died the year before last year, and me. The Karam <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. སྐྱོར་དཔོན] The monastic official who functions as the main teacher in the Dharma Grove (chöra) where monks go to study debating and logic.">gyorpön</a> heard something or had suspicions, so he fled from the monastery.   

**Q:**  He is now in New York and I met him.   

**A:**  His name is Thubten Wangyal [Tib. ཐུབ་བསྟན་དབང་རྒྱལ]. They released us and made us stay in Rabsel [Tib. རབ་གསལ] in the Tratsang for 4 or 6 days, like under house arrest. The <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. གྲྭ་ཚང] A &quot;college&quot; within a monastery, for example, in Drepung Monastery there were four main tratsang: Gomang, Loseling, Deyang and Ngagpa. These tratsang were property owning corporate entities and included monks who were organized into residential dormitories called Khamtsen.">tratsang</a> gave us food during this time.   

**Q:**  Where was the abbot?   

**A:**  He was in the Labrang and nothing happened to him because he would not attend the meeting. It would have been inappropriate to invite the abbot to the meeting so they invited the Labrang's <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཕྱག་མཛོད] A senior manager/treasurer of an aristocratic or monastic estate, or the senior manager/treasurer of an aristocratic family or a monastic unit. Generally chandzö handled both internal and external issues and were considered higher in power and status than nyerpa (stewards), who typically only handled the storerooms.">chandzö</a> instead.   

**Q:**  Who sent you the message to come to the meeting?   

**A:**  The <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཆབ་རིལ] The Chabril&#x27;s main work was overseeing serving the traja. He was also the servant of the gegö and khempo. It had a middle status of the types of lene. The chabril was also the one responsible for beating the gong at the tsog and chöra. The chabril got an extra share of gye in the tratsang.">chabril</a> and <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཆབ་གཡོག] An assistant or servant of the chabu.">chabyog</a> would send the message for the meeting.   

**Q:**  What kind of meeting did you think it was going to be?   

**A:**  We thought it was the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཚོགས་འདུ] 1. The general name for the various types of Tibetan government assemblies. 2. Any assembly, e.g., the assembly (meeting) of monks in a college.">tsongdu</a> with 14 members; This <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཚོགས་འདུ] 1.

Generally chandzö handled both internal and external issues and were considered higher in power and status than nyerpa (stewards), who typically only handled the storerooms.">chandzö</a>, 2 clerks, the 2 uchö. This was the usual meeting, but the uchö wouldn't always come. This assembly also had the 4 <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. སྣ་ཆེན] The name used for the largest Khamtsen in Drepung (or Sera, or Ganden).">nachen</a>; the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. དགེ་རྒན] 1. Teacher in a school. 2. In monastic settings it also refers to an adult monk who acted as a guardian to a younger monk. In such cases, the younger monk typically lived in the gegen&#x27;s apartment (shag). In monasteries, however, it could also mean a real teacher, or the monk who served as the guarantor for a new monk.">gegen</a> of the four large <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཁང་ཚན] A monastic residential unit in which monks from specific geographic areas lived. These were corporate entities with property and internal officials. Some large khamtsen had smaller subordinate units called mi tshan. Khamtsen were part of tratsang (colleges). For example, Hamdong Khamtsen was part of Gomang College in Drepung Monastery.">khamtsen</a>: Samlo, Hamdong, Bati and Gungru. Then they added the 2 clerks and it became the tsondu of 16 members.   

**Q:**  What about the 2 representatives from the other 12 <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཁང་ཚན] A monastic residential unit in which monks from specific geographic areas lived. These were corporate entities with property and internal officials. Some large khamtsen had smaller subordinate units called mi tshan. Khamtsen were part of tratsang (colleges). For example, Hamdong Khamtsen was part of Gomang College in Drepung Monastery.">khamtsen</a>?   

**A:**  They are the nayog [Tib. སྣ་གཡོག]. They don't count them in the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཚོགས་འདུ] 1. The general name for the various types of Tibetan government assemblies. 2. Any assembly, e.g., the assembly (meeting) of monks in a college.">tsondu</a>. This tsondu is the middle size one and they all had the extra shares of salary and the alms.   

**Q:**  When you went to the meeting, did you see the monks waiting there?   

**A:**  No.   

**Q:**  Did you suspect trouble?   

**A:**  I didn't have any doubts. I thought it was a meeting. I didn't think such things would happen because we were doing work for the benefit of the Buddhism. But some others may have had some doubts and some of them said that they are not going to the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. འཇང] 1. The area called Jang. 2. The special winter debating session for monks that was held annually in Jang.">Jang</a> Günchö, but I told them it will be not be good if you didn't go there. In the beginning, we were supposed to do something stable and calm [Tib. བརྟན་ལྷིང] but later it became like this.   

**Q:**  What did you think when they grabbed you? Did you think they would kill you?   

**A:**  I didn't think they would kill me. And even if they killed me, I wouldn't care because I was single minded [Tib. བློ་གཅིག]. I was involved because I believed in this, not because someone incited me to do it. First I was a <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ལས་སྣེ] The general name for all monastic officials.">lene</a> and secondly I had studied some <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. དཔེ་ཆ] Religious books/texts, scriptures.">pecha</a> though I couldn't complete it. If I could help other pechawa, I will have the same result. Karam Gyorpön and I were working wholeheartedly [Tib. བློ་གཅིག་སེམས་གཅིག].   

**Q:**  The main ones in your groups were you and Karam gyorbön and then there were the abbot's <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཕྱག་མཛོད] A senior manager/treasurer of an aristocratic or monastic estate, or the senior manager/treasurer of an aristocratic family or a monastic unit. Generally chandzö handled both internal and external issues and were considered higher in power and status than nyerpa (stewards), who typically only handled the storerooms.">chandzö</a> and the Samlo Drepa, right?   

**A:**  Yes.   

**Q:**  What happened during the four days you were under arrest? Did they talk with you?   

**A:**  No, they didn't come to beat us and they didn't talk to us. They were acting as if they had won the victory. Even now they are still holding [different] kind of view [Tib. ལྟ་སྟངས] to me like the proverb, "the meadow has become white, but the rabbit still smells the green grass" [Tib. སྤང་སྐྱ་ཐག་ཆོད་ཀྱང། རི་བོང་སྔོ་ཐག་མ་ཆོད] But I just feel pity [Tib. སྙིང་རྗེ] on them.   

**Q:**  At that time, was there any threat against the life of the abbot?   

**A:**  No. He was just staying in the labrang.   

**Q:**  The abbot then was Kelsang Lengden, right?
