### Tape 1  
**Q:**  Tell us how you first became a monk. Your own
     experiences.   

**A:**  I became a monk at age 7.   

**Q:**  How many family members did you have?   

**A:**  There were 8-9 persons in my household; grandfather,
     grandmother and my late mother. At that time, there were not many children.   

**Q:**  Who was your gegen (guardian/teacher)?   

**A:**  My gegen was my maternal uncle. He died in about 1963. We
     stayed as a household after 1959 (for awhile) and then I left the monastery.   

**Q:**  How old are you now?   

**A:**  I'm 68 years old. My home was around Trisam [Tib. khri
     zam] near Lhasa. According to our custom, I belonged to Kyormolung [Tib. skyor mo lung]
     Tratsang, so I should have first become a monk in Kyormolung Tratsang and then come to Drepung.
     But I asked Kyormolung for the chödrö. Then I entered directly into Drepung. I had to ask for
     the chödrö [release from one's lord) or my vows wouldn't have been pure. One has to ask one's
     parents and one's lord [Tib. dpon po] also, otherwise one's vows are not pure. This was a
     saying in the old society. I had to give 3 sho or 5 sho for the chödrö. From
     age 7-11, I was a monk in Gomang Tratsang and I studied düdra. There are 6 classes, one each
     year: khatog garmar, düdring, düchen , tagrik, lurik [These are the classes in düdra]. Every
     year we stay in one class. There are 8 chöthog in a year: some are monthly, dachö [Tib. zla
     chos], some chöra are on the 20th (nyishu [Tib. nyi shu]), and some chöra are on the 15th (Tib.
     jönga [Tib. bco lnga]). Based on these semesters, we take the exams before the tratsang uchö.
     We take the exams during a meeting.   

**Q:**  Are these studied before the tsenyi starts?   

**A:**  These are not tsenyi. After the 6 years of the (initial
     düdra) classes, then you have to start once again in class one with khatog garmar while
     studying tsenyi.   

**Q:**  Do you have to learn by heart the khatog garmar?   

**Q:**  These are the names of the classes like düdring and
     düchen in the düdra. When you start learning tagrik and lurik, then you start debating. After
     we have memorized the prayers recited in tsog and after one has finished lurik, then the exam
     is passed. Then we collect donations and there is a special prayer assembly (tsog) that is done
     at the end of lurik called lurik düsang [Tib. dus bzang]. For this, the tratsang gegö and umdze
     would investigate and appoint an umdze from among the those boys with the best voices. There
     were some monks who are called dönsangnga [Tib. 'don bzang ba] who had their own organization
     to learn the prayer chantings of the tratsang. And in Gomang they sit in the prayer assembly
     meetings on the left and right sides of the front row. On the 24-25th of the 7th Tibetan month,
     the dönsangnga would assemble for one week.   

**Q:**  When you first came into the shag how many gidru were
     there?   

**A:**  Just me.   

**Q:**  Did your parents want you to join or did maternal uncle
     ask you to?   

**A:**  No. I asked myself, I wanted to be a monk like my uncle.
     So they made me a monk and I became the gidru of my maternal uncle.   

**Q:**  Did you know how to write before you entered the
     monastery?   

**A:**  No. My gegen found me a pechai gegan. My gegen, in order
     to make me learn better, sent tsamba and tea and had me live with my pechai gegan so I couldn't
     wander around. In that way I memorized all the tratsang's prayers recited in the assembly [Tib.
     'don chos].   

**Q:**  How did you learn to write and read?   

**A:**  There was no school in the monastery teaching the written
     form of the alphabet [Tib. dbu med]. My gegen had 3-4 other students. Two of us lived with the
     pechai gegan (one was his gidru) and later the other gidru, called Gendün Tashi [Tib. dge 'dun
     bkra shis], didn't stay in Drepung and went to Chushü Kharag [Tib. chu shur kha rag?] and
     became a monk in the Büde Gomchen [Tib. sbud bde sgom chen]. I didn't meet him later. There was
     another one who would come in the morning and leave in the evening.   

**Q:**  What was your tratsang?   

**A:**  I was in Gomang and within that in Hamdong [Tib. har
     gdong] Khamtsen and my mitsen was Hor.   

**Q:**  Did you have to do the shöndre?   

**A:**  Yes. I have to do the shöndre in the khamtsen and the
     mitsen. Later, just before the revolt I wasn't in the order of Drepung because I was
     [expelled], because I was jailed. The poor monks criticized me because I was the umdze. But I
     said I was from the üpong class. I had been promoted step by step through doing all the shöndre
     and became the tratsang umdze and you are saying I am trerim. At that time, all of the monks
     who are üpong also hoped some day that they could become a monastic official.   

**Q:**  Was your gegen a pechawa?   

**A:**  No he wasn't. I studied tsenyi for awhile and went to
     Jang Günchö, but I wasn't able to do keep on doing that because in the Iron-Tiger or Iron-Hare
     Year the tsogchen umdze died. Then the umdze of Gomang Tratsang got appointed as the umdze of
     the tsogchen. Then in the tratsang, there were about 30 odd youths from the dönsannga who had
     good voices and they had a competition of their voices. One day, the chabu, abbot, gegö and
     umdze came and we had a voice competition three times. In the end, there were three left as the
     final contenders for the tratsang umdze post. Then they did the senriy and
     rolled the three names in front of the protector deity Maha Kala, Gönpo [Tib. mgon po] and I
     was selected. I was 28 years old at that time. If I hadn't been selected umdze, I would have
     continued to study as a pechawa, but once I was umdze, I couldn't study pecha anymore. The post
     of umdze needs someone with a good voice and a large body. I did this until
     1958. In the past in Gomang there were many students and geshe studying tsenyi and people say
     that Gomang Tratsang was the source of many scholars.  During the 6 year term
     of each abbot it was expected that there would be 60 geshe graduates. But in recent times, only
     2, 3, or 4 graduated. Because of this, the tse ga called us and asked why there were just a few
     geshe in Drepung where in the past the were so many geshe. Later when we examined this, we
     found that there were many geshe, but they had not completed their education in all the five
     main tsenyi texts [Tib. gzhung pu ti lnga] like didn't learn the dzö [Tib. mdzod] and düwa
     [Tib. 'dul ba]. Therefore, the number of the new students learning tsenyi and the number of the
     passing geshe was unbalanced. So we thought this is not good and has to be changed.  In general, there were over 4,000 monks in Gomang, but in the chöra, there were
     only 100-200 monks. The rest just took the name of the monk, but was wearing the mask of
     religion [Tib. chos 'bag gon] but we didn't notice it. Actually, the discipline and the
     structure in Gomang was good; there was the laji and chabu and the 14 members of the tsondu and
     there were the khamtsen and the mitsen. But the number of geshe was declining. So we got the
     idea that we have to do something to reverse this trend. There was a danger in the future that
     the people might ask who were the monastic officials then.  So we thought we
     must do something. The government's salary to the monks used to be distributed in the chöra.
     And monks, even those aged 75 to 80 used to come to the chöra to collect their salary. But
     these monks don't know their grade [Tib. 'dzin grwa] - they didn't even know which grade to sit
     in since they came so infrequently. So some of us thought that we should
     start paying the tratsang salary in the chöra and we started to discuss this among ourselves.
     Then they started this practice and did it once. We thought that if we pay salary in the chöra,
     more monks would come to the chöra.   

**Q:**  What is the difference if you paid the salary in the
     chöra?   

**A:**  If we paid the salary in the chöra, with the exception of
     the ones with special privileges, all will come to the chöra and the assembly in the chöra will
     become big. We wouldn't have to say come specially to study pecha but just by coming 2, 3, 4,
     or 5 times they will get into the habit of learning pecha. But later it didn't work out.   

**Q:**  What kind of salary was paid by Tibetan Government?   

**A:**  It was paid in money in the chöra.   

**Q:**  Was there a fixed amount?   

**A:**  No. This was just the left over from performing the
     rituals. We got this idea [to pay the tratsang salary in the chöra], in the past the tratsang
     salary was paid in the area near the main gate [Tib. sgo mchor], but later trouble occurred
     over it and two ideologies [Tib. lta ba] developed.   

**Q:**  After you got the idea, how did you go about doing it?
     Did you ask the abbot?   

**A:**  We asked the abbot and the 16 khamtsen (under Gomang
     tratsang).   

**Q:**  Who was the abbot then?   

**A:**  First the abbot was Chömphel Jamyang [Tib. chos 'phel
     'jam dbyangs] then at the time of the trouble it was Kelsang Lengden [Tib. skal bzang legs
     ldan]. It was in 1958.   

**Q:**  What did the abbot say?   

**A:**  He said it was a good idea and agreed. The other main
     supporters were the abbots' chandzö, the senior, Samlo Drepa [Tib. bsam lho bgres pa] the Karam
     [Tib. bka' ram] gyorpön and an Amdo pechawa and me. These were the main ring leaders [Tib. gte
     po]. The Samlo Drepa was in the same shag as the abbot. Our plan was to make
     more pechawa. For example, the custom is to have 60 geshe passed during each abbot's 6-year
     term, but even if we got 30-40 it would be okay. However, we were having only 1-2-3 geshe a
     year. At this rate, it looked like the geshe would definitely become finished. The abbot was
     the main one who tried to do something, but it didn't work.   

**Q:**  How many monks came to mangja?   

**A:**  Maybe 300-400 monks on the regular four mangja.   

**Q:**  Who first came up with the idea. Was it you?   

**A:**  We were the ones who started.   

**Q:**  How many people were there?   

**A:**  This was backed by the majority of the pechawa. At that
     time, the pechawa and the lagyüba became two sides. Our idea was supposed to be the idea of the
     tratsang.   

**Q:**  When you asked the abbot, your idea became the same,
     right?   

**A:**  Yes.   

**Q:**  According to the monastery's charter [Tib. sgrig gzhi],
     after asking the abbot, then to whom do you have to ask?   

**A:**  Our first strategy was to ask the abbot whether he agreed
     and he did. Then we asked the Dalai Lama for the divination regarding whether it was good to
     pay the salary in the chöra. Then the lagyüba said we won't agree and we won't accept this
     because this is a new rule that we didn't have in the past [Tib. sngar med gsar spros]. And
     then the trouble got worse. There was an office in charge of performing additional rituals in
     the Jokhang, I am not sure but it was probably called Nangsi Shaphar Lekhung [Tib. snang srid
     zhabs 'phar las khungs]. They came as mediators. At this time, we thought the mediators were
     not in favor of paying salary in the chöra, so we didn't accept their mediation. Then the monks
     made an commotion and beat us up and then we were called to the tse ga in Norbulinga and about
     30 some lagyüba were expelled and I [I was umdze] and the abbot's' chandzö, the karam gyorpön,
     the Amdo and the Samlo Dreba and another pechawa were beaten by the monks.   

**Q:**  How did this happen? Were those dobdo who beat you?   

**A:**  We got a message from the chabri saying come to a
     tratsang tsondu. We went and the monks and dobdo were waiting there and they pretended to
     report the matter. Then they tied us to pillars and beat us. This was my first struggle session
     [laughter]. This was in 1958.   

**Q:**  Was there any discussion before the beating?   

**A:**  No none. It was really a struggle session. There were
     about 30-40 dobdo in front who grabbed us. At this time, we didn't have any idea who was
     backing the dobdo from behind the scene. After the revolt, in jail, we found out it was Thubten
     Tserin [Tib. thub bstan tshe ring] the ex-abbot of Düwa [Tib. 'dul ba] and Takhare, the Jiso.
     Later they confessed that they stirred up the dobdo.   

**Q:**  Did the 14 members of the tratsang tsondu have any
     discussions? How many meetings did they hold?   

**A:**  No discussions. They only had one meeting but it was of
     no benefit because most people in the tsondu were on the lagyüba's side.   

**Q:**  Who had the authority change the salary distribution?   

**A:**  The abbot. But in the 14 tsondu members there were more
     lagyüba. On our side there were the abbot's chandzö and the Samlo Drepa who both were in the
     abbot's shagtsang. That's why they were expelled. Nothing happened to the abbot.   

**Q:**  Did the abbot say that you have to do that?   

**A:**  Yes. And after that the laji also talked in between, but
     they didn't listen to it.   

**Q:**  When the abbot said that the salary should be given in
     the chöra, the lagyüba didn't listen, right?   

**A:**  Yes. In essence, the abbot's order was not accepted by
     the lagyüba. They said, "You have made a new rule which didn't exsist in the past."   

**Q:**  Did you submit a petition to the Dalai Lama?   

**A:**  We submited the request for the divination.   

**Q:**  How did you ask for the divination?   

**A:**  We asked the Dalai Lama for divination saying the
     Tratsang's studies are declining, the government salary is paying in the chöra and there is a
     big gathering of monks, so please do the divination, and whether it is good or not to pay the
     tratsang salary in the chöra? He answered it is good to do it in chöra. Because of this
     divination, we didn't listen to the mediation.   

**Q:**  Who asked for the divination?   

**Q:**  We, the pechawa, asked for the divination.   

**Q:**  Did you go to the Potala?   

**A:**  We asked via Kündeling Dzasa Wöser Gyentsen [Tib. kun bde
     gling 'od zer rgyal mtshan].   

**Q:**  He was part of your group?   

**A:**  Yes. Things weren't settled until the 16th of the 12th
     lunar month when the pechawa returned. The pechawa left for Jang Günchö on the 1st of the 11th
     month. They returned on the 16th of the 12th month. The pechawa thought that they should not go
     to Jang Günchö because if they went, the remaining pechawa might have problems. But the umdze
     said you must go. Otherwise there will be one problem put on top of another. It's better if you
     go. The lagyüba knew that most of the pechawa were at Jang Günchö and it was this time that
     they started beating pechawa. Now in retrospect, I think that was the correct decision. The
     reason for this is that because most of the pechawa had gone to Jang Günchö, the lagyüba were
     able to beat a few of us, but if the mass of the pechawa were there, then two large groups
     would have confronted each other and there would have been a big fight. This didn't happen.   

**Q:**  When did you ask the Dalai Lama for the divination? Did
     the Nangsi Ritual Office do the mediation in Lhasa or in Drepung?   

**A:**  It was in Lhasa.   

**Q:**  Did you attend this meeting?   

**A:**  Yes.   

**Q:**  What can you tell us about it?   

**A:**  I can't say much about it.   

**Q:**  Who was the main leader of the Nangsi Ritual Office?   

**A:**  The main person was Trunyichemmo Bumthang [Tib. 'bum
     thang]. It was held in the Khamsum [Tib. khams gsum] where there were many people. At that
     time, it was kind of a chaotic situation and I didn't see well.   

**Q:**  Did the representatives of both sides have to talk?   

**A:**  No we didn't have to. The officials announced the written
     mediation decision, dumtra [Tib. 'dum khra], to us. We refused to accept this mediation.   

**Q:**  Did the lagyüba accept this?   

**A:**  It seemed that they kind of accepted it.   

**Q:**  What was in the dumtra?   

**A:**  I don't remember exactly but it was unfavorable to us. It
     said that the salary should not be paid in the chöra so we didn't accept it. The Nangsi Office
     also gave the pechawa some money. The other side didn't get any money. It is a custom for the
     mediator to do this. I don't remember this too well. Since we didnt accept the mediation I
     didn't pay too much attention to it. It has been about 40 years.   

**Q:**  Did they beat you when they beat the other people in
     Gomang?   

**A:**  Yes, not too badly. They tied us to a pillar a little bit
     and they also searched our pouches of the robe, but I had nothing because being a monk we are
     not allowed to do reckless things. I heard that they [lagyüba] themselves had guns and the guns
     fell out in the kitchen.   

**Q:**  Who was the ring leader of lagyüba?   

**A:**  The one now living in Sera called Wöser Chökyong [Tib.
     'od zer chos skyong]   

**Q:**  Was the Dalai Lama's divination done before they issued
     mediation document?   

**A:**  It was after the Dalai Lama's divination, so we started
     insisting on paying the salary to the chöra. That is why we refused to accept when the laji
     called and said something when the Nangsi Office did the mediation.   

**Q:**  What did the lagyüba say about the Dalai lama's
     divination when they refused to accept that?   

**A:**  They said, "Actually they didn't ask for the divination
     and they just made it up." Out of 4,000 monks in Gomang, in reality there were only about 400
     true students of pecha.   

**Q:**  What did the rest of the monks do?   

**A:**  They were doing farming, business and stealing. That's
     what they really did. At this time, some monks went to Tsöna [Tib. mtsho sna] and India to
     trade and became bankrupted in business so they stole things and they were caught and beaten in
     jail. Then they quietly came back to the monastery and acted like regular monks. These kinds of
     behavior are called "wearing a religious mask", chöbagön [Tib. chos 'bag gon] but after the
     revolt the Communist Party put the religious mask on us and we wore it. Whatever work you do,
     you have to do it truthfully. These kinds of behavior will get their accounting like the saying
     in the old society, "the Lord of Death is more ferocious than this lord and the future life is
     much longer than the present life" [Tib. dpon 'di las chos rgyal 'jigs skrag che/ tshe 'di las
     gting ma shul thag ring]. Everybody has to go through this. If you don't be careful and say
     that one is great, there will be a problem.   

**Q:**  What would be the sense of making dobdo sit in the chöra?
     They won't learn anything; why not just pay the pechawa more special salary?   

**A:**  That would have resulted in more pechawa, but if we did
     this it would have caused even more comments [Tib. lta stangs]. It will be quite hard for us to
     do that. If we paid the pechawa more salary, the problems would have increased because everyone
     said that all the monks are equal. If we did this, it would have been good and would have
     resulted in more pechawa, but the lagyüba would have said all monks are equal and now you are
     making distinctions among the monks. Secondly,if we were to pay this kind of money, we have no
     capital for this, so the tratsang chabu would have to pay it. However, the chabu and lagyüba
     had the same way of thinking of this, like the proverb, "the disease caused by the same devil"
     [Tib. gdon gcig zin gyi na tsha]. So there was no way for this to occur.
     Mainly the Labrang (the abbot) had saved up money and gave us a little bit from time to time
     and we, the uchö also did like that and gave a little bit money like 1-2 sang or 5 sho on the
     chöra. Even for this, the lagyüba made a little comment. In reality, if you are a monk, then
     you should study tsenyi, if not you will not be regarded as a monk. But they say that they want
     money even it is one fen and they don't want to work.  At this time, we
     didn't say a word about paying pechawa more money since this would have been considered making
     distinctions among monks though it would been good in the long run future. But later, after
     they threw us out of the monastery, the Tibetan Government gave 4-5,000 dotse as capital to
     Gomang (for this) to be given to the chöra. A special cashier, ngünyer [Tib. dgnul gnyer] was
     appointed to handle this money to give additional income to help the pechawa. We never got any
     of it.   

**Q:**  This was like an endowment [Tib. ma rtsa] for the
     livelihood supplement [Tib. 'tsho snon] of the pechawa, right?   

**A:**  Yes.   

**Q:**  Was this for the Jang günchö?   

**A:**  No. It was for the chöra.   

**Q:**  Did they beat you by hand or stick?   

**A:**  They beat us with switches [Tib. rgyug pa phra po].   

**Q:**  How did they catch you?   

**A:**  They held the meeting, then they grabbed us and tied us
     to the pillar. They tied up the Samlo Drepa, the Labrang's chandzö, the an Amdo monk from the
     Shungba [Tib. gzhung pa] who died the year before last year, and me. The Karam gyorpön heard
     something or had suspicions, so he fled from the monastery.   

**Q:**  He is now in New York and I met him.   

**A:**  His name is Thubten Wangyal [Tib. thub bstan dbang
     rgyal]. They released us and made us stay in Rabsel [Tib. rab gsal] in the Tratsang for 4 or 6
     days, like under house arrest. The tratsang gave us food during this time.   

**Q:**  Where was the abbot?   

**A:**  He was in the Labrang and nothing happened to him because
     he would not attend the meeting. It would have been inappropriate to invite the abbot to the
     meeting so they invited the Labrang's chandzö instead.   

**Q:**  Who sent you the message to come to the meeting?   

**A:**  The chabril and chabyog would send the message for the
     meeting.   

**Q:**  What kind of meeting did you think it was going to be?   

**A:**  We thought it was the tsongdu with 14 members; This
     tsondu included the 5 chabu and Labrang chandzö, 2 clerks, the 2 uchö. This was the usual
     meeting, but the uchö wouldn't always come. This assembly also had the 4 nachen; the gegen of
     the four large khamtsen: Samlo, Hamdong, Bati and Gungru. Then they added the 2 clerks and it
     became the tsondu of 16 members.   

**Q:**  What about the 2 representatives from the other 12
     khamtsen?   

**A:**  They are the nayog [Tib. sna g.yog]. They don't count
     them in the tsondu. This tsondu is the middle size one and they all had the extra shares of
     salary and the alms.   

**Q:**  When you went to the meeting, did you see the monks
     waiting there?   

**A:**  No.   

**Q:**  Did you suspect trouble?   

**A:**  I didn't have any doubts. I thought it was a meeting. I
     didn't think such things would happen because we were doing work for the benefit of the
     Buddhism. But some others may have had some doubts and some of them said that they are not
     going to the Jang Günchö, but I told them it will be not be good if you didn't go there. In the
     beginning, we were supposed to do something stable and calm [Tib. brtan lhing] but later it
     became like this.   

**Q:**  What did you think when they grabbed you? Did you think
     they would kill you?   

**A:**  I didn't think they would kill me. And even if they
     killed me, I wouldn't care because I was single minded [Tib. blo gcig]. I was involved because
     I believed in this, not because someone incited me to do it. First I was a lene and secondly I
     had studied some pecha though I couldn't complete it. If I could help other pechawa, I will
     have the same result. Karam Gyorpön and I were working wholeheartedly [Tib. blo gcig sems
     gcig].   

**Q:**  The main ones in your groups were you and Karam gyorbön
     and then there were the abbot's chandzö and the Samlo Drepa, right?   

**A:**  Yes.   

**Q:**  What happened during the four days you were under arrest?
     Did they talk with you?   

**A:**  No, they didn't come to beat us and they didn't talk to
     us. They were acting as if they had won the victory. Even now they are still holding
     [different] kind of view [Tib. lta stangs] to me like the proverb, "the meadow has become
     white, but the rabbit still smells the green grass" [Tib. spang skya thag chod kyang/ ri bong
     sngo thag ma chod] But I just feel pity [Tib. snying rje] on them.   

**Q:**  At that time, was there any threat against the life of
     the abbot?   

**A:**  No. He was just staying in the labrang.   

**Q:**  The abbot then was Kelsang Lengden, right?   

**A:**  Yes.   

**Q:**  How did they settle matter after some time?   

**A:**  Then they released us and soon after that the government
     issued the verdict [Tib. bka' dpyad] for these people and we were called to the tse ga at
     Norbulinga.   

**Q:**  Who were called there?   

**A:**  All of the people who were to be expelled were called.   

**Q:**  How many of you were expelled from your side?   

**A:**  Samlo Drepa, Karam gyorpön, Labrang's chandzö and Amdo
     Yeshe and me and about 35 from the other side. They were made to do prostration at tse ga for a
     week. This was in winter. It was in Norbulinga in Kelsang Phodrang [Tib. skal bzang pho brang].
     The trouble occurred before the monks returned on the 16th of the 12th month from Jang günchö.   

**Q:**  At first did they hold a kind of meeting when they issued
     the verdict?   

**A:**  No meeting.   

**Q:**  If they issued the verdict, it must be drönyerchemmo
     Phala Thubten Wönden [Tib. pha lha thub bstan 'od ldan]?   

**A:**  Yes. At tse ga, they read the verdict to us and then
     later they gave the verdict to the tratsang.   

**Q:**  Did they write the crimes of each people in the verdict?   

**A:**  In the verdict, there was the list of names to be
     expelled but no list of their crimes.   

**Q:**  Did you have to leave your shag right away?   

**A:**  No, we were allowed to stay in the shag. We were expelled
     from the kyidu of the monastery.   

**Q:**  But you didn't leave the monastery.   

**Q:**  If I didn't stay in the shag, there is no way to make the
     living.   

**Q:**  But you couldn't go to prayer assembly, right?   

**A:**  Yes.   

**Q:**  So how did you make your living during that one year?   

**A:**  I had my 2 gidru in the shag and there were 2 gegen. So I
     stayed reading pecha in the shag until the revolt.   

**Q:**  If you stay in the monastery, they didn't say anything,
     right?   

**A:**  Yes.
