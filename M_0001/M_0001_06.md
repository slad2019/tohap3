**A:**  When I was about 25, the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. སྤྱི་བསོ] The head managers/stewards of monasteries as a whole, especially the large Gelugpa monasteries like Sera and Drepung.">jiso</a> and the rigji [Tib. རིགས་སྤྱི] did a investigation on land, sashib [Tib. ས་ཞིབ].   

**Q:**  What did they actual do in the sashib?   

**A:**  It was to attack the farmers and investigate the lands and as a result of this, they found some had more lands and some had less. In fact the farmers were really hard. I was a farmer, but I didn't know about the situation, but after the revolution, I was imprisoned and then I stayed at home and became a farmer. If we really became a good farmer and worked hard, it is okay. ]] My family members were <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. མི་སེར] A term that can mean serf/bound subject as well as citizen, depending on context. For example, the miser of a lord would connote the bound subjects of that lord, whereas the miser of Tibet would connote citizens of Tibet.">miser</a> of Kyomolung [Tib. སྐྱོར་མོ་ལུང]. After I left prison, I went to my household and they had 58 <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཁལ] A traditional volume measurement used for measuring grain in traditional Tibetan society. Sizes of this unit varied somewhat, but the official government khe (called mkhar ru or bstan dzin mkha ru) weighed about 28-31 pounds for barley. It was used to convey the size of fields. For example, a field said to be 10 khe in size meant that 10 khe of seed could be sown on that field.">khe</a> of land. I said at this time, I didn't want any land, my family has a lot of land so I said that I don't want more land. I worked hard on this and got a good yield. I had to sell 170 khe of grain as selling grain [Tib. སྤུས་ཚོང] [got a little money]. The <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. རྒྱལ་གཅེས་གཞུང་འབྲུ; ch. 公粮] A kind of tax or forced sale collected by the government during the commune and mutual aid team eras. It was grain that families or brigades had to give the government out of &quot;patriotism&quot; without any payment. The amount was initially based on real yields, but later was set by the government based on presumed yields.">donation grain</a> [Tib. རྒྱལ་གཅེས་གཞུང་འབྲུ] was little less than 40 khe [no money for this] [the market price was 15 <a href "#" data-tooltip "[ch. 元] China&#x27;s basic currency unit. A yuan is divided into 100 fen and 10 jiao. It is also known as renminbi or &quot;people&#x27;s currency.&quot;">yuan</a>=for=1=khe=of=grain]. And then when I left the seed, I could barely manage my livelihood, but when they set up the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. རུ་ཁག] A brigade (in a commune).">rukhag</a>, we became real beggars. We had to give all our farming equipment and animals to the rukhag. I had two big <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. མཛོ] A cross between a yak and a cow/ox.">dzo</a>, I paid 80 khe of grain for one dzo and paid 30 of grain for the other one. I also had 3 horses and 2 baby mules. They only paid me 60 yuan for each baby mule. They paid 100 yuan for each dzo. After the rukhag started we were left as individual household [Tib. ཁེར་རྐྱང་དུད་ཚང].   

**Q:**  At that time, the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. གྲལ་རིམ; ch. 阶级] 1. A social class. 2. A class enemy.">trerim</a> were left as individuals, right?   

**Q:**  My home was a <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. གྲལ་རིམ; ch. 阶级] 1. A social class. 2. A class enemy.">trerim</a> and I could stay as same as my home. When I first came out, they made the decision in the monastery and I was told, "From now on, you have the political right [Tib. སྲིད་དབང] and the people who regard you as a reactionary, they are wrong."   

**Q:**  So they didn't label you, right?   

**A:**  Yes. And they returned me home. I was a religious worker [Tib. ཆོས་ལས་པ] and nobody said anything about me being a <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. གྲྭ་ཚང] A &quot;college&quot; within a monastery, for example, in Drepung Monastery there were four main tratsang: Gomang, Loseling, Deyang and Ngagpa. These tratsang were property owning corporate entities and included monks who were organized into residential dormitories called Khamtsen.">tratsang</a> umdze. One of my household's <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. མག་པ] A groom who moved matrilocally at marriage to the household of his bride and became part of her household. In Tibet, the normal custom was the opposite, i.e., women moved to the households of their husband at marriage.">magpa</a> was a uyön of the Farmer's Association [Tib. ཞིང་པ་མཐུན་ཚོགས]. In 1961 I was let out of jail after the decision was made in Drepung. From 1961-66 I stayed home and I could help my home quite well on doing the farming. In 1966, there was the Three Great Education [Tib. slop bso chen mo gsum] movement was held.   

**Q:**  Before that, did you get any chance of performing rituals?   

**A:**  Not at all.   

**Q:**  Did you do some at home?   

**A:**  Yes a little bit. In the Three Great Education, they investigated in detail. In my family, my mother had only one child, me. The rest of the chil<a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. བྲེ] A unit of traditional volume measurement [a container] in Tibet, 20 of which typically equaled one khe or bo [also a container], although in some areas there were only 16 dre in one khe.">dre</a>n were in the household who are the children of my maternal aunt. She had 3 daughters. The youngest is in a different home. At the time of the Three Great Education, the youngest one said that she was a servant in our household when she was young. But really we all were relatives from the same parents and ate the same food. But she accused us at this time. When I returned in 1961 the household was very poor. They only had one <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཕྱུ་པ] The traditional Tibetan men and women&#x27;s dress. It is like a robe that is tied at the waist. Both men and women wear such dresses, although they differ slightly in color and in style.">chupa</a> and a woolen boot with leather sole for the 4 daughters to wear outside which they would wear by turns. The land was good, but they couldn't handle it. They only had a very weak ox which they would beat and it was even bleeding a little bit on his back. And the land was full of cocongrass. One of the daughters of my maternal aunt had left for Nyero [Tib. ཉེ་རོ]. I heard that usually, she would throw the seeds in the land. So there was nobody throwing the seed. Then our neighbor who was related to us was also kind of ridiculing us saying, "Now who is going to throw the seed?" I said I will throw the seed because I am from this household. And my family members said that I can't do that, but I said that I will do it as an experiment and asked them usually how much seed do you use for the field and they said that they use one <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཁལ] A traditional volume measurement used for measuring grain in traditional Tibetan society. Sizes of this unit varied somewhat, but the official government khe (called mkhar ru or bstan dzin mkha ru) weighed about 28-31 pounds for barley. It was used to convey the size of fields. For example, a field said to be 10 khe in size meant that 10 khe of seed could be sown on that field.">khe</a> and five dre if you throw little big thick and use one khe if you throw it little thiner. Then I planted a field by throwing the seed little bit thin and they said that I have used one khe of seed. When I asked whether it is okay, they said it is okay. In that year, there was a heavy rain fall on beginning of summer, so the yield was excellent. When I was throwing seed the people were watching me because in that area, only the adult women throw the seeds.   

**Q:**  How many times of yield did you get?   

**A:**  I got 9 times yield [Tib. དགུ་སྐོར] and I got little less than 1,000 <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཁལ] A traditional volume measurement used for measuring grain in traditional Tibetan society. Sizes of this unit varied somewhat, but the official government khe (called mkhar ru or bstan dzin mkha ru) weighed about 28-31 pounds for barley. It was used to convey the size of fields. For example, a field said to be 10 khe in size meant that 10 khe of seed could be sown on that field.">khe</a> from 58 khe of land because it was a good harvest.   

**Q:**  In 1962, did you have the same amount of land that you had in 1958?   

**A:**  I had the same amount of <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཁལ] A traditional volume measurement used for measuring grain in traditional Tibetan society. Sizes of this unit varied somewhat, but the official government khe (called mkhar ru or bstan dzin mkha ru) weighed about 28-31 pounds for barley. It was used to convey the size of fields. For example, a field said to be 10 khe in size meant that 10 khe of seed could be sown on that field.">khe</a> of land that I had before the uprising in 1959.   

**Q:**  In the past, to whom did your household was belong to?   

**A:**  We were <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. མི་སེར] A term that can mean serf/bound subject as well as citizen, depending on context. For example, the miser of a lord would connote the bound subjects of that lord, whereas the miser of Tibet would connote citizens of Tibet.">miser</a> of Kyomolung Tratsang [Tib. སྐྱོར་མོ་ལུང]. We had one <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཁྲལ་རྐང] The name of the basic tax unit for arable land in traditional Tibetan society. Families with farm land would have one or more fields of different sizes, e.g., 1 tregang or 1/2 of a tregang. This was defined by a fixed number of khe of seed (tib. sönkhe) that would be sown on that field. For example, one tregang in some areas would consist of 10 sönkhe. There was substantial variation between and within regions and types of estates.">tregang</a> for which we had to provide one <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. འུལ་ལག] A generic term for corvée labor that had to be performed for one&#x27;s manorial estate/lord without pay. One kind of ula required people to go and work and another kind required the provision of transportation animals.">ula</a> everyday during the whole year. This was the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ནངཏྲེ] The tax that miser/serfs paid to their lord in contrast to the &quot;outer tax&quot; that they paid to the government.">inner tax</a>, <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ནང་ཁྲལ] The taxes and corvée labor services one provided to one&#x27;s own lord (as opposed to chitre which were paid to the government).">nangtre</a> [Tib. ནང་ཁྲལ]. We had 4 <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཁལ] A traditional volume measurement used for measuring grain in traditional Tibetan society. Sizes of this unit varied somewhat, but the official government khe (called mkhar ru or bstan dzin mkha ru) weighed about 28-31 pounds for barley. It was used to convey the size of fields. For example, a field said to be 10 khe in size meant that 10 khe of seed could be sown on that field.">khe</a> and 10 <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཁྲལ] A tax.">tre</a> of land which was given from the upper part of valley along with the house.   

**Q:**  Did you have to work for the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཕྱི་ཁྲལ] The taxes that peasants paid to the government as opposed to their own lords (the inner tax).">chitre</a> for the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. སྡེ་བ་གཞུང] The name of the traditional Tibetan government.">dewashung</a>?   

**A:**  No. We also had an additional land given by Kyormolung Monastery based on lease for which we had to give 75 on lease.   

**Q:**  Did you have to pay taxes in kind like wool etc?   

**A:**  No. Historically, <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. སྟག་བྲག] The regent of Tibet who replaced Reting in 1941 and served until 1950 when the 14th Dalai Lama assumed power.">Taktra</a> Rimpoche was born in our household and we had a <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. གཞིས་ཀ] A manorial estate.">shiga</a> called Trongjung [Tib. གྲོང་ཆུང] Shiga. The shiga had a protective deity who was dressed in a lay official dress. In the past, the household was okay but after Taktra was born, the family became very poor and they gave the shiga to Kyomolung Tratsang and they told the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. གྲྭ་ཚང] A &quot;college&quot; within a monastery, for example, in Drepung Monastery there were four main tratsang: Gomang, Loseling, Deyang and Ngagpa. These tratsang were property owning corporate entities and included monks who were organized into residential dormitories called Khamtsen.">tratsang</a> to give them a house for the lama's parents to stay and they gave the house called gangkyi [Tib. སྒང་སྐྱིད], for which we didn't to pay any taxes. In the early times, there was a special government tax called barley tax [Tib. འབྲུ་འཕྱགས] but we didn't even have to pay this and the monastery paid it. We had a document to this effect. Whatever we planted like wheat, barley, etc, on the day for paying the lease, we had to pay 75 of barley to the monastery. And now it has become two households and we had to pay 150 khe. We had to clean the barley and put them in new sacks [Tib. སྒྱེ་མོ] and they also put new ropes for hanging the bell on the necks of the pack donkeys. Then the monks would come where the barley is kept carrying their sacks and it was directly given to the monks and the monastery; this is very good and also gave us a <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཁ་བཏགས] A Tibetan ceremonial scarf given to lamas, visitors, etc.">khata</a> and rice.   

**Q:**  When you pay 75 <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཁལ] A traditional volume measurement used for measuring grain in traditional Tibetan society. Sizes of this unit varied somewhat, but the official government khe (called mkhar ru or bstan dzin mkha ru) weighed about 28-31 pounds for barley. It was used to convey the size of fields. For example, a field said to be 10 khe in size meant that 10 khe of seed could be sown on that field.">khe</a> for the lease, what was the actual yield you get at the time? How many khe of land did you plant?   

**A:**  We plant about 54 <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཁལ] A traditional volume measurement used for measuring grain in traditional Tibetan society. Sizes of this unit varied somewhat, but the official government khe (called mkhar ru or bstan dzin mkha ru) weighed about 28-31 pounds for barley. It was used to convey the size of fields. For example, a field said to be 10 khe in size meant that 10 khe of seed could be sown on that field.">khe</a> of land. I don't think we had a good yield at that time. In the 3rd, 4th and the 5th month, the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. རྩམ་པ] The traditional Tibetan staple food that consists of grain that is roasted (popped), usually in sand, and then ground into a flour.">tsampa</a> would run out. And they would owe a lot of loan, so I asked them "How did that happen? If you do well the farming, it should be okay." But they didn't do the farming well. Us two families built a house and at this time, Kyomolung monks said you must have large profit from this land on lease and are getting a lot of yield, so the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཕྱག་མཛོད] A senior manager/treasurer of an aristocratic or monastic estate, or the senior manager/treasurer of an aristocratic family or a monastic unit. Generally chandzö handled both internal and external issues and were considered higher in power and status than nyerpa (stewards), who typically only handled the storerooms.">chandzö</a> thought this was very profitable land and took the lease land back. We were made to move to the land in the upper part of the valley. Our lease land was leased out to another household for about three years at a higher rate (raised from 150 to 500).   

**Q:**  At that time, you couldn't refuse it saying that we had the pledge, right?   

**A:**  Yes. They had taken back the pledge and didn't give it back.   

**Q:**  When did they take back the land?   

**A:**  Probably around 1945 when the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. སྟག་བྲག] The regent of Tibet who replaced Reting in 1941 and served until 1950 when the 14th Dalai Lama assumed power.">Taktra</a>'s regency was over.   

**Q:**  Then it is in 1950. If the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. སྟག་བྲག] The regent of Tibet who replaced Reting in 1941 and served until 1950 when the 14th Dalai Lama assumed power.">Taktra</a>'s term was not over, it should not have happened like this. The other household who took the land paid 500 <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཁལ] A traditional volume measurement used for measuring grain in traditional Tibetan society. Sizes of this unit varied somewhat, but the official government khe (called mkhar ru or bstan dzin mkha ru) weighed about 28-31 pounds for barley. It was used to convey the size of fields. For example, a field said to be 10 khe in size meant that 10 khe of seed could be sown on that field.">khe</a> of barley and planted it for 3 years, but since the land was not good, they made no profit, so then stopped planting it. The reason for taking it back was that we built the new house, but we first asked the monks to come and see the old house which was falling apart to see why we felt we had no choice but to build a new one. We bought the beams and pillars from the monastery, but we couldn't pay, so we asked them to make it into a loan agreement. At this time, each beam and pillar was 1.5 sang. We built a house with 3 pillars upstairs and 3 pillars downstairs with a small courtyard. [The land was lost probably just after he became umdze]. When I got out of prison, my family was very kind in taking me in even though I was a <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. གྲལ་རིམ; ch. 阶级] 1. A social class. 2. A class enemy.">trerim</a> and also letting me take down the 2nd story and using the wood to build a new one story house for myself. In the old society this household and I were separate in eating food and spending money. If they came to Drepung I would invite them to the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. 1. ཤག, 2. ཞག] 1. The apartment/room of a monk. 2. The butter fat that coagulates on the top of butter-tea when the tea is left to sit for some time. If the tea had been made with a lot of butter, this layer could be thick enough to scoop off and save to later sell or eat separately. The senior monks are usually served tea with a lot of shag.">shag</a> and give tea, but that's all. We weren't that close. I became a trerim, the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. མངའ་ཚབ; ch. 领主代理人] Agents of the lords of manorial estates (as classified by the Chinese Communist Party), for example estate managers.">ngatsab</a> in <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. གནས་ཆུང] 1. One of the main protector deities of the Tibetan government and the Dalai Lama. 2. The monastery in which the medium of Nechung resides that is located just east of Drepung Monastery.">Nechung</a> [Tib. གནས་ཆུང] in the Three Great Education time. At that time, in the Work Team [Tib. ལས་དོན་ཚོགས་ཆུང], there was a great Muslim woman called Dzelahai. I went to her and said, "I am a trerim and I am going to be separate from my family." She said, "If you and your home had a fight you can split, if its just because you are trerim, it is not okay to be separate. So I didn't have to get split with them. Then the Three Great Education was over and they held summary [Tib. མཇུག་སྡོམ] meeting and the cadre also said that you don't need to be separate from the household if the household agrees to live together. This was very helpful for me. In 1966, when they set up the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. རུ་ཁག] A brigade (in a commune).">rukhag</a>, we and our neighbor weren't allowed to join in the rukhag until 1969. We were able to plant and get good yields and the animals were also there and we had a pair of plowing <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. མཛོ] A cross between a yak and a cow/ox.">dzo</a> and the other household also had one. Near to us, there was a State Farm belonged to Rinpung [Tib. རིན་སྤུང] where the rukhag would go to plow their fields and when the rukhag didn't have enough plowing animals, they hired us for 3 <a href="#" data-tooltip="[ch. 元] China&#x27;s basic currency unit. A yuan is divided into 100 fen and 10 jiao. It is also known as renminbi or &quot;people&#x27;s currency.&quot;">yuan</a> per day plus food for plowing their fields with horses. We were doing okay and then in 1968, since our condition was quite good the trerim households were also put into the rukhag as members, but not me. I was given few fields and divided the fertilizers and I was kept separate. At that time, I thought that even though I was left separated, I could do the farming. So I went to the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[ch. 乡] An administrative unit that contains several villages. It is sometimes called a rural township in the literature on China. Several xiang are part of a xian (county).">xiang</a> and told the xiang zhang how they made me to stay separate and how they divided the land and I asked whether this was the decision from the xiang. The xiang zhang said that he didn't know anything abut this and he told me to you go home. That night, the rukhag <a href="#" data-tooltip="[ch.] The head/leader of an office.">dütrang</a> held a meeting and the xiang zhang asked the dütrang, "Who gave you permission to do this? It is not okay to do that." So that year I stayed separate but then I asked them whether I should stay separate or I can stay with my family and then I was allowed to rejoin my family. On the next day, when my family joined the rukhag I was also told that I can join the rukhag, but I suffered a great loss which was not amicable with the policy. They told me, "You don't have animals, so you have to work in the xiang which is without payment" [laughter] and I had to work 100 days in a year for three years without getting paid because I was a trerim. I also didn't get the work point grain [Tib. སྐར་འབྲུ]. And then I was also called to the county.   

**Q:**  Mostly, what would you have to do during that time?   

**Q:**  In the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[ch. 乡] An administrative unit that contains several villages. It is sometimes called a rural township in the literature on China. Several xiang are part of a xian (county).">xiang</a>, I had to work on planting trees and they made us to work on the constructions like demolishing the Ramoche Temple in Kyomolung and all the earth and stones were carried out. The inner walls were built with pounded earth [Tib. གྱང] and the outter wall of the temple where people go for circumambulation was buit by stone. I was made to build the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. གནས་ཆུང] 1. One of the main protector deities of the Tibetan government and the Dalai Lama. 2. The monastery in which the medium of Nechung resides that is located just east of Drepung Monastery.">Nechung</a> [Tib. གནས་ཆུང] Xiang. Then they made us to build a vermicelli factory [Ch. <a href "#" data-tooltip "[ch. 分] 1/100th of a yuan; one cent.">fen</a>=chang] and they produced vermicelli. We also built a very big pig pen near Taglungdra where the place was made like a State Farm. And we also built houses for the people to stay in. After I was called to the county, I got some benefit from the work point. Though I was paid the daily wages 1 <a href="#" data-tooltip="[ch. 元] China&#x27;s basic currency unit. A yuan is divided into 100 fen and 10 jiao. It is also known as renminbi or &quot;people&#x27;s currency.&quot;">yuan</a>, 7 <a href="#" data-tooltip="[ch. 毛] A Chinese currency unit. 10 maotse = 1 yuan. 10 fen = one maotse.">maotse</a> and the 5 fen, when I had to hand it over to the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. རུ་ཁག] A brigade (in a commune).">rukhag</a>, I got the highest work point in the rukhag. In the years 1981, 1982, they made me to do the unpaid work ad I told some people but it didn't help.   

**Q:**  In the old society when you worked as an <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. འུལ་ལག] A generic term for corvée labor that had to be performed for one&#x27;s manorial estate/lord without pay. One kind of ula required people to go and work and another kind required the provision of transportation animals.">ula</a>, did you get food?   

**A:**  No. We have to take everything like food and clothes. It was a tax. I tried to recollect about the accounting of <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. སྒོ་མང] One of the large colleges in Drepung Monastery.">Gomang</a>, but since I don't have anything to tell you about the amount of the endowment and the amount of the interest we got. So I can't tell you clearly. Anyway, for example, in one month, if we had bought like 5 boxes of brick tea and 2 loads of tea balls, we would deduct the money from the account and write in the expenditure list [Tib. སོང་ཁྲ] and add up the tea in the account and write it in the list of receiving things [Tib. བྱུང་ཁྲ]. In the following months, when we use whatever amount of tea bricks, it will be written in the list iof the expenditures. That's the way the accounts were done. There was no detailed accounting with receipts. They just checked over whatever was written in the books by the clerk.   

**Q:**  How would you do the 6 months accounting?   

**A:**  At the 6 month's accounting, we would add up the monthly income and expenditure and the amount of leftover for each month and we would get the totals and we did the same when we do the annual accounting. I became umdze at 28 years old, so I was young. I don't remember much of this. When I was 37 years old the revolt began. I was expelled when I was 36. I stayed at home from 39-65. From when I was 65, I came to <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཇོ་ཁང] A most famous temple in Lhasa that houses a holy statue of the Buddha. It is often used to mean the Tsuglagang Temple of which it is a part.">Jokhang</a> in 1988.

**A:**  The <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. གཉེར་ཚང] 1. Storehouse. 2. Steward, person in charge of a storehouse. 3. A monastic official in charge of storerooms.">nyertsang</a> is separate. The accounting is done by the tratsang. The clerk reads the accounts.   

**Q:**  Who would use the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. རྡེའུ] The traditional method of Tibetan arithmetic that uses a board and a variety of items like beans, sticks and stones.">diu</a>?   

**A:**  The <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. རྡེའུ] The traditional method of Tibetan arithmetic that uses a board and a variety of items like beans, sticks and stones.">diu</a> was mainly used by the clerk and sometimes I also did that.   

**Q:**  Who would check whether the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. རྡེའུ] The traditional method of Tibetan arithmetic that uses a board and a variety of items like beans, sticks and stones.">diu</a> is done correctly or not?   

**A:**  We would do that and all the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཕྱག་སྦུག] A manager (of estates and endowments) of a monastic college or monastic khamtsen.">chabu</a> should come there. Sometimes, one person read the account and two people use the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. རྡེའུ] The traditional method of Tibetan arithmetic that uses a board and a variety of items like beans, sticks and stones.">diu</a> and later we also used the abacus when one of the Samlo Drepa called Nagtshang Tenphel la [Tib. ནག་ཚང་བསྟན་འཕེལ་ལགས] who was good in using the abacus. After that, there was a clerk who is a mixbreed of Tibetan and Nepalese who lived in Ramoche [Tib. ར་མོ་ཆེ]. He brought math like adding up and subtracting and division. Our accounting is for the chabu not for the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. གཉེར་ཚང] 1. Storehouse. 2. Steward, person in charge of a storehouse. 3. A monastic official in charge of storerooms.">nyertsang</a> who was separate in giving <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. གཏོང་སྒོ] A monastic obligation to provide the food and other necessary items served at a monastic prayer assembly meeting or some other rite; this was often a required obligation for monastic officials at the end of their term of office.">tonggo</a> and paying salaries. After the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཆོས་ར] The special grove (&quot;dharma grove&quot;) in monasteries where monks formally met to practice debating.">chöra</a> was over, the monks would recite a prayer and then they come to the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. གྲྭ་ཚང] A &quot;college&quot; within a monastery, for example, in Drepung Monastery there were four main tratsang: Gomang, Loseling, Deyang and Ngagpa. These tratsang were property owning corporate entities and included monks who were organized into residential dormitories called Khamtsen.">tratsang</a> and the uchö would check whether the necessary salary was completely brought or not and they put a seal on it and the person who brought the salary would also put a seal on it.   

**Q:**  Who does the accounting for the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. དངུལ་གཉེར] Accountant, bookkeeper, cashier. Someone in charge of cash.">ngünyer</a>?   

**A:**  The <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཕྱག་སྦུག] A manager (of estates and endowments) of a monastic college or monastic khamtsen.">chabu</a> do it.   

**Q:**  Can you tell us more about your law case in the Branch Judicial System where the Disputes were Settled, Gyöship [Tib. gyod zhip]. How did it come about?   

**A:**  The case was sued by the representative of the mass monks. Before that, we were doing the accounting on those things carefully. The discussion had been going on for some time among monks when the representative complained to the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཕྱག་སྦུག] A manager (of estates and endowments) of a monastic college or monastic khamtsen.">chabu</a> that our monks' livelihood is poor. So please think about helping the monk's livelihood.   

**Q:**  To whom did the monks tell that?   

**A:**  In the beginning, they came to the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. གྲྭ་ཚང] A &quot;college&quot; within a monastery, for example, in Drepung Monastery there were four main tratsang: Gomang, Loseling, Deyang and Ngagpa. These tratsang were property owning corporate entities and included monks who were organized into residential dormitories called Khamtsen.">tratsang</a> and since they said all the things that were not acceptable [Tib. རྣ་བར་མ་འགྲོ་བ], we didn't heed to them because their spear head [Tib. མདུང་རྩེ] was pointed towards the chabu. Then they reported the Gyöship. So the Gyöship did the investigation.   

**A:**  After how many months did they report the Gyöship after they first told the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. གྲྭ་ཚང] A &quot;college&quot; within a monastery, for example, in Drepung Monastery there were four main tratsang: Gomang, Loseling, Deyang and Ngagpa. These tratsang were property owning corporate entities and included monks who were organized into residential dormitories called Khamtsen.">tratsang</a>?   

**A:**  Maybe 5-6 months or a year passed and then the representative of the monks went to the Gyöship Office to petition for action.   

**Q:**  Then the Gyöship Office sent a notice and called you to the Gyöship Office, right?   

**A:**  Yes.   

**Q:**  Who else were there when you were called there?   

**A:**  All the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཕྱག་སྦུག] A manager (of estates and endowments) of a monastic college or monastic khamtsen.">chabu</a> were there and there was one clerk who was capable and they checked all the accounts in the Gyöship Office located on the Tsuglagang. The <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. དགེ་སྐོས] The main disciplinary official in a monastic college (tratsang).">gegö</a>, umdze also went there.   

**Q:**  Did the representative of the monks have to go there? And who were them?   

**A:**  Yes. The representative of the monks were the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཨ་མདོ] One of the three main Tibetan sub-ethnic areas. It is located in the northeast of the Tibetan Plateau mostly in today&#x27;s Qinghai Province. A person from Amdo is called an Amdowa.">Amdo</a> Chabey Tsütrim [Tib. ? tshul khrims].   

**Q:**  Is he still alive in Drepung?   

**A:**  I don't think so. He was quite old then and then there was Drala Gombo,[Tib. དགྲ་ལྷ་མགོན་པོ] from Chabra <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཁང་ཚན] A monastic residential unit in which monks from specific geographic areas lived. These were corporate entities with property and internal officials. Some large khamtsen had smaller subordinate units called mi tshan. Khamtsen were part of tratsang (colleges). For example, Hamdong Khamtsen was part of Gomang College in Drepung Monastery.">khamtsen</a>'s [Tib. ? ]. These two were the main ones and both of them were old and might be dead. But when they checked the accounts, there was nothing wrong, so in the end, the representative of the monks had to give us each a <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཁ་བཏགས] A Tibetan ceremonial scarf given to lamas, visitors, etc.">khata</a> due to the order of Gyöship Office and in the end, we won the dispute. [laughter] They came to my <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. 1. ཤག, 2. ཞག] 1. The apartment/room of a monk. 2. The butter fat that coagulates on the top of butter-tea when the tea is left to sit for some time. If the tea had been made with a lot of butter, this layer could be thick enough to scoop off and save to later sell or eat separately. The senior monks are usually served tea with a lot of shag.">shag</a> to give me the khata, but I returned the khata back. That was kind of chaotic sitiation.   

**Q:**  At that time, there weren't anything like back door relation?   

**A:**  Not at all because this was really complicated case and the accounting started from the Water Horse Year.   

**Q:**  Did you do the accounting according to the book or did you have receipts or <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཕྱག་སྦུག] A manager (of estates and endowments) of a monastic college or monastic khamtsen.">chabu</a>'s signature for buying things like tea leaves etc?   

**A:**  We didn't have receipts and signatures at all.   

**Q:**  So there was the way of telling lies saying you paid more than you actually paid and they won't know if you put some expenses that was spent before 3-4 years, right?   

**A:**  Yes. Later, I became the accountant of a construction contract <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. རུག; རུ་ཁག; ch. 队] A large administrative unit in Tibetan communes that consisted of several villages. The full name for brigade was &quot;production brigade&quot; (tib. ཐོན་སྐྱེད་རུ་ཁང; ch. 生产队), although most Tibetans just used the abbreviation &quot;ruga.&quot; In Tibet, communes/brigades were initiated primarily in the late 1960s.">brigade</a> [Ch. bao gong dui] and since all the receipts were in Chinese I had a lot of problem, because I don't know Chinese and had to ask people to read it. Anyway, we could make 500 <a href="#" data-tooltip="[ch. 元] China&#x27;s basic currency unit. A yuan is divided into 100 fen and 10 jiao. It is also known as renminbi or &quot;people&#x27;s currency.&quot;">yuan</a> per month out of the wages.   

**Q:**  How much wages do you get?   

**A:**  Just before the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. རུ་ཁག] A brigade (in a commune).">rukhag</a> [Ch. gong she] was dispersed we get 1 <a href="#" data-tooltip="[ch. 元] China&#x27;s basic currency unit. A yuan is divided into 100 fen and 10 jiao. It is also known as renminbi or &quot;people&#x27;s currency.&quot;">yuan</a> and 7 <a href="#" data-tooltip="[ch. 毛] A Chinese currency unit. 10 maotse = 1 yuan. 10 fen = one maotse.">maotse</a> per day. After the rukhag was dispersed they increased the wages and best was paid 3 yuan and in addtion, they would put 3 days wages for the over time whether we actually did it not. If we worked hard we would earn about 500 yuan per month. At that time, I was the person we make other people to work, so I had to offend others verbally and the worse was the carpenters and I would tell them, "We were all paid the same wages and you people take away gums, nails, glasses, etc, but we all ran out our wages at the same time. So what happened? If you don't work and learn the skill, you will suffer the loss in the future. Do not steal. The more you steal, you become courageous and then you will become useless."

**Q:**  Is the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཁང་ཚན་དགེ་རྒན] The head official of a khamtsen.">khamtsen gegen</a> done by turns?   

**A:**  Yes, by turns. [It actually goes by turns to the 9 mitsen, it seems] First they become <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཁང་ཚན་དགེ་རྒན] The head official of a khamtsen.">khamtsen gegen</a>, then the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཕྱག་མཛོད] A senior manager/treasurer of an aristocratic or monastic estate, or the senior manager/treasurer of an aristocratic family or a monastic unit.
