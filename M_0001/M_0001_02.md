**Q:**  Please tell me about alms and salary in <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. སྒོ་མང] One of the large colleges in Drepung Monastery.">Gomang</a> Tratsang?   

**A:**  With regard to the alms, the abbot got 30 shares. For example, if a regular monk got 1 he got 30. Alms have higher shares than salary. Then the uchö and <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. དགེ་སྐོས] The main disciplinary official in a monastic college (tratsang).">gegö</a> got 10 shares in <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཚོག] 1. An offering made of tsamba, butter and dry cheese in the shape of a cone. 2. A prayer assembly meeting in monasteries when all the monks come to an assembly hall and chant prayers together.">tshog</a> and <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. གྲྭ་ཇ] The prayer session sponsored by the tratsang (college) at which tea was served to its monks who attended.">traja</a> and got 2 shares for being in <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཚོ] A group, an administrative unit, a nomad group.">tsho</a>ndü 14. Making a total of 14 shares. The umdze got 9 shares in <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཚོགས] 1. A prayer assembly meeting in monasteries when all the monks come to an assembly hall and chant prayers together. 2. An offering made of tsamba, butter and dry cheese in the shape of a cone.">tsog</a> and 2 in <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཚོགས་འདུ] 1. The general name for the various types of Tibetan government assemblies. 2. Any assembly, e.g., the assembly (meeting) of monks in a college.">tsondu</a> making 11 shares. Everyone in <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཚོགས་འདུ] 1. The general name for the various types of Tibetan government assemblies. 2. Any assembly, e.g., the assembly (meeting) of monks in a college.">tsongdu</a> 14 got 2 extra shares. As to the tsondü, I forgot the two <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. གཉེར་ཚང] 1. Storehouse. 2. Steward, person in charge of a storehouse. 3. A monastic official in charge of storerooms.">nyertsang</a> and 1 nayog yesterday. [80] Whenever there are alms in the tshog shung they got the 2 extra alms in the tsondu also. There were the 7 main officials in Trat<a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. སྲང] A unit of traditional Tibetan currency. It was also called ngüsang [tib. དངུལ་སྲང]. 50 nügsang = 1 dotse; 10 sho = 1 nügsang; 20 5-karma coins = 1 ngüsang. There were also paper currency notes of 7-sang, 25-sang, and 10-sang denominations.">sang</a>, laji gegö, umdze, 2 <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཆབ་རིལ] The Chabril&#x27;s main work was overseeing serving the traja. He was also the servant of the gegö and khempo. It had a middle status of the types of lene. The chabril was also the one responsible for beating the gong at the tsog and chöra. The chabril got an extra share of gye in the tratsang.">chabril</a> chabyog, 2 <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཇ་མ] The monk(s) in charge of a monastery&#x27;s kitchen.">jama</a>, <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཇ་གཡོག] Assistant to the Jama (The monk who is in charge of a monastery&#x27;s kitchen).">jayog</a> 1 <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ནང་མ] A minor monk assistant to the Shengo at the Mönlam Chemmo Prayer Festival. These nangma ranked below the Chagdampa.">nangma</a>. I think the ones, other then uchö, each got 2 shares. The nangma served as a kind of servant for the gegö. The <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཕྱག་སྦུག] A manager (of estates and endowments) of a monastic college or monastic khamtsen.">chabu</a> and nyertsang didn't get any extra shares in tshog shung. But they got the 2 extra from the tsondu. The T<a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཞོ] A unit in the traditional Tibetan currency system. 10 sho equaled to 1 sang and 10 karma equaled one sho.">sho</a>gchen <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. སྤྲུལ་སྐུ] An incarnate lama.">trülku</a> also got extra shares. Tratsang trülku wouldn't get extra, they just got one share. Among the tshogchen trülku there was the gyaltrül which was highest [ones who have done Regent], then there was the tritrül - ones who had been Tri Rimpche at Ganden. In <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. སྒོ་མང] One of the large colleges in Drepung Monastery.">Gomang</a>, the Duwa <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. མཁན་པོ] Abbot of a monastery or monastic college.">khembo</a> also got extra shares, probably no more then 2-3 shares. The gyaltrül got about 7-8 extra shares [not sure], and the gyaltrül may have gotten about 15 [?] shares but I am not sure. Also the Tratsang <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཆོས་མཛད] The title of monks who made a payment or gave gifts to secure exemption from the normal &quot;young monk&quot; work obligations. There were tratsang chöndze and khamtsen chöndze.">chöndze</a> and trülku got one alms in Tratsang without having to come in person. They could have someone else pick up their share. If they do come, then they got their share in the tshog rather than outside, and the share they would have gotten outside, goes to the gegö who would use this to help finance the Donggo he had to throw at the end of his 6 month term. At the time of the winter session the günchö gegö was always a <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. དགེ་ཤེས] An advanced degree earned by scholar monks.">geshe</a> and at the time of summer session yarchö gegö would be lagyuba. This gegö's <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. བཏོང་སྒོ] An obligation to carry out a rite or prayer session in a monastery. For example, providing food and tea for all the monks in one&#x27;s monastic college at a prayer assembly. Or it could be an obligation to give all the monks a set amount of grain or the donggo obligation that many monastery office holders had to do when they left office. Generally, donggos had associated endowments that monks used by turns to fund a donggo. The monk with the donggo obligation would lend out the capital of the endowment and pay for the event from the interest he collected. This was also used for ritual obligations of government offices like the Tseja Office.">donggo</a> involves giving a traja and thugdö thugdö was the case equivalent of the actual thugba -- this usually costs about 1-3 sho per monk in the Tratsang. There are about 100+ enchöndze (Lama, Tratsang chöndze). They all had the special privilege of not having to come to get their alms. The gegö carried this outside in a special kind of purse. And he gave alms to each of the enchöndze who are specified on a list of those with this special privilege. [172] So if they came to [?] tshog, then the gegö doesn't have to pay these alms after tshog, so he can pocket this and use it for his tonggo. It's one of his incomes. The gegö sometimes tells the enchöndze, today come to tsho, so that he could make some income. Alms were usually not very high. 1 <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཏམ་ཀ] A unit in the traditional Tibetan currency system that was equal to 4 sang. Also a silver coin.">trangga</a> 3 sho (2 tranga) or 5 sho. The highest was one sang (= 10 sho). This was old custom (for paying), it didn't start during our memory (time).   

**Q:**  Are the enchöndze in 7 monastic officials?   

**A:**  No. [more on this later] To become Trat<a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. སྲང] A unit of traditional Tibetan currency. It was also called ngüsang [tib. དངུལ་སྲང]. 50 nügsang = 1 dotse; 10 sho = 1 nügsang; 20 5-karma coins = 1 ngüsang. There were also paper currency notes of 7-sang, 25-sang, and 10-sang denominations.">sang</a> Chöndze you have to give a donggo. You have to give <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. འགྱེ] Alms given to monks.">gye</a> and thugdö. There are no extra shares for the thugdü. Even the abbot only got one share. The <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཆོས་མཛད] The title of monks who made a payment or gave gifts to secure exemption from the normal &quot;young monk&quot; work obligations. There were tratsang chöndze and khamtsen chöndze.">chöndze</a> rank was bought, not earned by studying pecha. They didn't study pecha. They would give a mediocre alms and thugdö, and then be able to sit above their teachers. Normally, it's not too notable, but at Mönlam the chöndze sit in a row, and then under this was the first name list tsentho (row) of the monks. [199] During my time, there were a lot of chöndze being done but they were giving as little as possible--only giving mediocre donggo. Really for a <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. གྲྭ་ཇ] The prayer session sponsored by the tratsang (college) at which tea was served to its monks who attended.">traja</a> you <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཞོ] A unit in the traditional Tibetan currency system. 10 sho equaled to 1 sang and 10 karma equaled one sho.">sho</a>uld be giving 8-9 <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཁལ] A traditional volume measurement used for measuring grain in traditional Tibetan society. Sizes of this unit varied somewhat, but the official government khe (called mkhar ru or bstan dzin mkha ru) weighed about 28-31 pounds for barley. It was used to convey the size of fields. For example, a field said to be 10 khe in size meant that 10 khe of seed could be sown on that field.">khe</a> of butter since this was a special rank, but they were giving only 4 khe which was the amount the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. གཉེར་ཚང] 1. Storehouse. 2. Steward, person in charge of a storehouse. 3. A monastic official in charge of storerooms.">nyertsang</a> gives in normal traja. It was getting so bad. That he and his Tratsang <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. དགེ་སྐོས] The main disciplinary official in a monastic college (tratsang).">gegö</a> decided a new rule should be made to set standards for getting <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. སྒོ་མང] One of the large colleges in Drepung Monastery.">Gomang</a> Tratsang chöndze. We had discussions and people said for supply rite for chöndze, we should weigh the tea and butter by jin. Everyone must give 1000 offerings insisted of butter lamps <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. གཏོར་མ] A ritual offering made from tsamba and water.">torma</a>, and water offering incense and flower, tongchö. In past, the candidates didn't give tongchö and just left 3 sang of money, and gave 1 trangka was one sho and five <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. སྐར་མ] 1. The smallest currency unit (a copper coin) in the traditional Tibetan currency system. Ten karma equaled 1 sho. 2. A work point in post-1959 Tibet. 3. A person&#x27;s name.">karma</a> for alms. So we made proposal that from now on they had to weight butter and tea, and offer 1000 butter lamps, or in its place give each monk 1 trangka. The monk also has to leave an amount of money call bungjo. This was for chagbug's use. It used to be 7 <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. རྡོ་ཚད] A currency unit in traditional Tibet that was equal to 50 ngüsang.">dotse</a> and was increased 50 dotse. Unless monks offer these <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. གཏོང་སྒོ] A monastic obligation to provide the food and other necessary items served at a monastic prayer assembly meeting or some other rite; this was often a required obligation for monastic officials at the end of their term of office.">tonggo</a>, they can't become chöndze. Only Gomang has this custom of tongchö for chöndze. The standard for the chöndze's traja, fixed was 8 khe of butter and 2 bagjung bricks of tea. There were 4 bagchung in one package call bagkhag. If tomorrow was going to be a chöndze dongo, tonight <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཇ་མ] The monk(s) in charge of a monastery&#x27;s kitchen.">jama</a> and uchö have to go to weight the butter. On top there was alms. There was no standard for this. Whatever one gave so long as it was not less than 1 <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཏམ་ཀ] A unit in the traditional Tibetan currency system that was equal to 4 sang.">tranka</a>. In the past, for the thugdö the fee was 6 tranka, then it deteriorated to 2-3 sang, so we made the new rule.   

**Q:**  This happened during your time in office?   

**A:**  Yes. We first asked the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཚོགས་འདུ] 1. The general name for the various types of Tibetan government assemblies. 2. Any assembly, e.g., the assembly (meeting) of monks in a college.">tsondu</a> 14, then when they agreed, we asked the abbot for final okay.   

**Q:**  Who came up with the idea?   

**A:**  It was me and the gegö. There were many <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཆོས་མཛད] The title of monks who made a payment or gave gifts to secure exemption from the normal &quot;young monk&quot; work obligations. There were tratsang chöndze and khamtsen chöndze.">chöndze</a>, and the old monks would have to sit behind, and among all of them probably they were not almost pechawa.   

**Q:**  How did enchöndze get their alms if they didn't go to <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. གྲྭ་ཇ] The prayer session sponsored by the tratsang (college) at which tea was served to its monks who attended.">traja</a>?   

**A:**  They could <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. གཟན] The upper part of a monk&#x27;s dress.">sen</a>d someone to collect alms at <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. དགེ་སྐོས] The main disciplinary official in a monastic college (tratsang).">gegö</a>'s shag. If it was salary they had to send a gitru to collect the salary when the names were read at the front of the main gate, gomjo. Chöndze had to ask permission to not attend <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཚོག] 1. An offering made of tsamba, butter and dry cheese in the shape of a cone. 2. A prayer assembly meeting in monasteries when all the monks come to an assembly hall and chant prayers together.">tshog</a> from gegö. The term for gegö was 6 months. After every 6 months, a new gegö comes. <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. དབུ་མཛད] The name of the chant/prayer leader in a monastery.">Umdze</a> also had to ask. I am not sure if abbot has to do this. Umdze, e.g., also has to ask permission to wear a surge, therma sen instead of a surge gonam sen, and cloth shirt under sen, and certain vest etc. [303] I had to write a petition and give 2 <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཞོ] A unit in the traditional Tibetan currency system. 10 sho equaled to 1 sang and 10 karma equaled one sho.">sho</a> to gegö. In the past, one umdze of <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. སྒོ་མང] One of the large colleges in Drepung Monastery.">Gomang</a> became the Tshogchen umdze so after that all the umdze of Gomang were entitled to wear the clothes of the Tshogchen umdze. These were called Dringe thulog. Also all of those who were of the rank nyetsang and above could wear the kind of boots called resom. The rest wore shasumma boots. I also had to do servant yogo and I had to give the gegö their name and class number. They got permission to not attend tshog and chöra. In reality the gegö should have been checking precisely who was in each class and if they were present or not, so this permission was to cover this, but in truth no one checked who was in class like that in his day. This was a special authority. Later, in my time not many people even bothered to ask the gegö for this permission. Back to alms. The Dalai Lama's throne got 40 shares.   

**Q:**  How did monks know whether there was alms?   

**A:**  We give a message. There was a special big drum we beat to inform monks of this. And at the end of the morning session <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. དགེ་སྐོས] The main disciplinary official in a monastic college (tratsang).">gegö</a> will check [monks] tsizhag today.   

**Q:**  How did you and the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. དགེ་སྐོས] The main disciplinary official in a monastic college (tratsang).">gegö</a> know there would be a distribution of alms on a given day?   

**A:**  The sponsor who was giving alms had to come to the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཁང་ཚན] A monastic residential unit in which monks from specific geographic areas lived. These were corporate entities with property and internal officials. Some large khamtsen had smaller subordinate units called mi tshan. Khamtsen were part of tratsang (colleges). For example, Hamdong Khamtsen was part of Gomang College in Drepung Monastery.">khamtsen</a> to which he belonged and make relations with them. So if it was Hamdong khamtsen, he went to the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཇ་མ] The monk(s) in charge of a monastery&#x27;s kitchen.">jama</a> of Hamdong and the jama had to ask permission from the Labrang, the üjo and the 14 tshondu. If there was a tongchö then he asks to do this and have monks do the prayers associated with it. He gave the Labrang a chigye [7 and half karma], and gave the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. དགེ་སྐོས] The main disciplinary official in a monastic college (tratsang).">gegö</a> and jama one karma. He asked the umdze to do the appropriate prayer for tongchö to Jamgon Lama and gave a tranga. Couldn't do a choga since there were no instruments in <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. སྒོ་མང] One of the large colleges in Drepung Monastery.">Gomang</a> because only sutra studies were done there.   

**Q:**  This was just for when sponsors came hand in hand with alms etc. But were there also alms from trust funds?   

**A:**  No, if it was from a trust it was called salary in Gomang. For salary the different capital fund were divided among different sets of ngünye. Sometimes 2 ngünye and sometimes there are three 3 together and 4 together. They kept charge of the capital fund and lend out the money. The interest from this was what was paid as salary. The <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. དགེ་སྐོས] The main disciplinary official in a monastic college (tratsang).">gegö</a> changes every 6 months, so there was a six month accounting we do. There was a book called salary book, <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཕོགས] 1. Salary (for a job). 2. The salary-like payments in grain, etc., that monk&#x27;s receive from their monastery.">phog</a> deb which lists all the salary that had to be given each six months, and this book was kept by the uchö. If the salary was paid exactly as in the book, then the uchö would give the ngünye a receipt saying they did it. The accounting takes a day. If they have forgotten to do one or one was missing, then the uchö would tell them to do it the next day. The general customs and rules of doing work in the monastery were terrific, but the practice was poor and there were many difficulties because of this. The uchö particular had a heavy responsibility.   

**Q:**  How did you give alms in the in the assembly hall when there was <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. གྲྭ་ཇ] The prayer session sponsored by the tratsang (college) at which tea was served to its monks who attended.">traja</a> or <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཚོག] 1. An offering made of tsamba, butter and dry cheese in the shape of a cone. 2. A prayer assembly meeting in monasteries when all the monks come to an assembly hall and chant prayers together.">tshog</a>?   

**A:**  There were two ways we did this: monks are seated and usually 3 people went around. The first would say, "put out your hand" cha thethe, the 2nd would put the money into the hand, and the third would carry the money bag. There was also the custom that if the alms was 2 <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. སྲང] A unit of traditional Tibetan currency. It was also called ngüsang [tib. དངུལ་སྲང]. 50 nügsang = 1 dotse; 10 sho = 1 nügsang; 20 5-karma coins = 1 ngüsang. There were also paper currency notes of 7-sang, 25-sang, and 10-sang denominations.">sang</a>, then if the money was 1 silver coin trankga karpo (4 sang), then they would give 1 silver coin for 2 monks. If this happened, then the first monk would say two of you put out your hand jig nyi cha thethe. The second way was to have two lines (called <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. 1. ཤག, 2. ཞག] 1. The apartment/room of a monk. 2. The butter fat that coagulates on the top of butter-tea when the tea is left to sit for some time. If the tea had been made with a lot of butter, this layer could be thick enough to scoop off and save to later sell or eat separately. The senior monks are usually served tea with a lot of shag.">shag</a> khag) of monks filing out by the main door. The other door called jago was closed. Someone stood on each side and gave the monks in the line on his side the alms. The monks would leave as they got alms. The money givers stood on the doorstep itself.   

**Q:**  Who gave this money?   

**A:**  There was a monk called <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. འགྱེ] Alms given to monks.">gye</a> gtong jikyabba. He was hired by the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཇ་མ] The monk(s) in charge of a monastery&#x27;s kitchen.">jama</a> for the sponsor. There were a number of monks who were specialists in doing this. They were hired and they had to memorize all the different amounts of shares, for example that 40 shares went to the throne of the Dalai Lama, etc. They were like professionals.   

**Q:**  Did they get wages?   

**A:**  The sponsor probably said thank you and gave them some things, but there was no set amount.   

**Q:**  Did he read a book with the names of all the monks in the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཚོག] 1. An offering made of tsamba, butter and dry cheese in the shape of a cone. 2. A prayer assembly meeting in monasteries when all the monks come to an assembly hall and chant prayers together.">tshog</a> at the time of giving alms?   

**A:**  No I don't think so. At the end of the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཚོག] 1. An offering made of tsamba, butter and dry cheese in the shape of a cone. 2. A prayer assembly meeting in monasteries when all the monks come to an assembly hall and chant prayers together.">tshog</a>, the special privilege officials wait outside. After the tshog was over, then they read the list of names of those who had special privileges. The list would be read under the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. སྒོ་མཆོར] The area outside of the monastic assembly hall that is supported by tall pillars.">gomchor</a> by the umdze. (the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. དགེ་སྐོས] The main disciplinary official in a monastic college (tratsang).">gegö</a> stays there also). He read the list of the shares. First he read the list of the shares of the abbot and <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. སྤྲུལ་སྐུ] An incarnate lama.">trüku</a>, for example he would read, "the abbot gets 30 shares" (khen <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. རིན་པོ་ཆེ] 1. Title for an incarnate lama. 2. Term of address for incarnate lamas.">rimpoche</a> kugye sumju thampa), and then maybe the Duwa abbot will get such and such a share. When the umdze reads this, the representative of the trüku will come at once and pick up the share. Someone always picked up all the shares for those who were not there. When he finished the list of enchöndze, then the list of lower officials was read, e.g.,. those who manage buildings, the monks in charge of the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཆོས་ར] The special grove (&quot;dharma grove&quot;) in monasteries where monks formally met to practice debating.">chöra</a>, the monks who look after the trees in parks, the sweepers, and kitchen helpers. I had to read this list. But sometimes the sponsor wraps all the shares in an envelope and puts names on it. In this case, the umdze doesn't have to read it. If it was not wrapped like this, then it took a long time. On the days of giving alms, the uchö didn't go to the chöra. They sent replacements to the chöra. The monks who went for collecting donation, büdü would get double share. Normally not more than 5 monks were sent on büdü. <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. སྒོ་མང] One of the large colleges in Drepung Monastery.">Gomang</a> has only three places we sent people: Dzogde [?] <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཨ་མདོ] One of the three main Tibetan sub-ethnic areas. It is located in the northeast of the Tibetan Plateau mostly in today&#x27;s Qinghai Province. A person from Amdo is called an Amdowa.">Amdo</a>, Sog, Nyengrong Damshung. These places were ours [Tib. ཐོབ་ཁུངས]. Also there was a list of those who have been sent as abbot of a Branch Monastery.   

**Q:**  Did they send estate manager <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. གཞིས་སྡོད] An estate manager.">shidö</a> to collect the donation?   

**A:**  They were mostly <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཆོས་མཛད] The title of monks who made a payment or gave gifts to secure exemption from the normal &quot;young monk&quot; work obligations. There were tratsang chöndze and khamtsen chöndze.">chöndze</a>, who were going as büdü. So they had their share anyway and it was picked up for them. If the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. གཞིས་སྡོད] An estate manager.">shidö</a> wasn't a chöndze but was a regular monk, then he had to come in person. Doing büdü was a real complicated process. A <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. དགེ་ཤེས] An advanced degree earned by scholar monks.">geshe</a> was selected by seniority. He had to know a good bit of religion. No more than 5 could go as düdü. After this was settled, then these 5 people's would sell all their <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. 1. ཤག, 2. ཞག] 1. The apartment/room of a monk. 2. The butter fat that coagulates on the top of butter-tea when the tea is left to sit for some time. If the tea had been made with a lot of butter, this layer could be thick enough to scoop off and save to later sell or eat separately. The senior monks are usually served tea with a lot of shag.">shag</a>'s belongings. And for the last few weeks before leaving they moved into Tratsang Rabsel (the building where the offices are) since they had given up their shag. The money from the sale of their things was left with the Tratsang. Everything they will need on this trip and their stay for several years was bought by the Tratsang. They were going in essence to beg for donations. Then they left and stayed for whatever the term, 3-4-5 years, and then they would return. When they returned, they went straight to under the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. སྒོ་མཆོར] The area outside of the monastic assembly hall that is supported by tall pillars.">gomchor</a> to unload the loads there, and they stayed in Tratsang at first until they got a new shag. Then they did accounting.   

**Q:**  How much were the expenses before they left? What expenses did they have while there and on the road?   

**A:**  Then they calculate how much they obtained in büdü. They subtracted all the expenses from what the yield was, and the left over money was given to the monks as alms of 1-2-3 <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ད་ཡང; ch. 大洋] A Chinese silver dollar that had the image of Yuan Shikai on its face. It was used by the Chinese government in Tibet in the 1950s because Tibetans did not accept Chinese paper currency.">dayan</a> per monk. All this was read in a kyabtho in tshog.

There were tratsang chöndze and khamtsen chöndze.">chöndze</a> or the rank of ex Tratsang gegö. The highest rank he will get was Tratsang trülku. This was lower than khentrül. This was all under the chagbug. After they gave the alms if there was money left over, it went into the capital of the bug the chabug. [41] When this was all done, the lama and monks were returned the money from their belongings together with the interest from lending out this money. Then in addition to this they are given the alms and salary that had accumulated and their interests during their absence, and if they did well also some gifts of tables and chests for shag. The Tratsang chagbug had a lot of income, but the chagbug was not very generous. They were very careful about expenses. They gave us food at the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཚོགས་འདུ] 1. The general name for the various types of Tibetan government assemblies. 2. Any assembly, e.g., the assembly (meeting) of monks in a college.">tsondu</a> 14 but it was not aristocrat's food. It was rather stingy. [This was generally said about monks]. <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. སྒོ་མང] One of the large colleges in Drepung Monastery.">Gomang</a> had many houses in Lhasa. The rent was 6 sang and 5 sho. They didn't spend all this, they put away in the storehouse. They didn't spend it.   

**Q:**  What happens if the monk has <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཤག་ཚང] 1. The household or family of a monk that consisted of multiple monks. 2. The apartment of a monk household.">shagtsang</a> and <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. དགེ་ཕྲུག] 1. Student. 2. Disciple. 3. Commonly the name for monks living with a gegen or teacher.

The apartment of a monk household.">shagtsang</a> would go as büdü lama [Tib. འབུལ་སྡུད་བླ་མ]. So this never happened. I had a <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. དགེ་རྒན] 1. Teacher in a school. 2. In monastic settings it also refers to an adult monk who acted as a guardian to a younger monk. In such cases, the younger monk typically lived in the gegen&#x27;s apartment (shag). In monasteries, however, it could also mean a real teacher, or the monk who served as the guarantor for a new monk.">gegen</a> called Yanggi gegan. He went to Sogdzong [Tib. སོག་ཛོང] as büdü. He said it wasn't easy. When you arrive there are many people asking to do ritual and divination at once, and some of these aren't successful [e.g., a man goes bankrupt] and if you don't do divination well then the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. མི་སེར] A term that can mean serf/bound subject as well as citizen, depending on context. For example, the miser of a lord would connote the bound subjects of that lord, whereas the miser of Tibet would connote citizens of Tibet.">miser</a> won't have faith to you. Sometimes, even bandits came to ask where to go rob, and you had to do divination and say it's better to go there versus some other place. In <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཨ་མདོ] One of the three main Tibetan sub-ethnic areas. It is located in the northeast of the Tibetan Plateau mostly in today&#x27;s Qinghai Province. A person from Amdo is called an Amdowa.">Amdo</a> at age 15 the household gives a boy a horse, sword and gun, and then he was a man and goes off to raid others. Then they come back and raid him. The local people also asked all kinds of questions as a sort of test to see if he knows anything. But he has to be very careful in the first phase or the miser will not have faith and therefore would not give donations. [174] To be successful, the Lama must have a good <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. གཉེར་པ] A steward or manager. In some monasteries, the nyerba was in charge of storerooms under the authority of a higher manager called a chandzö.">nyerba</a> or <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཕྱག་མཛོད] A senior manager/treasurer of an aristocratic or monastic estate, or the senior manager/treasurer of an aristocratic family or a monastic unit. Generally chandzö handled both internal and external issues and were considered higher in power and status than nyerpa (stewards), who typically only handled the storerooms.">chandzö</a> to manage what was given. If the nyerba steals-i.e. doesn't give all to Dratsaan that was also bad and he would have a short life.   

**Q:**  Who picked the abbots of branch Monastery, gonlag [Tib. དགོན་ལག] and büdü?   

**A:**  The Tratsang <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཕྱག་སྦུག] A manager (of estates and endowments) of a monastic college or monastic khamtsen.">chabu</a> did it. The uchü didn't do it. All these secular things of the Tratsang the chabu do. If there was something particularly troublesome then the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཚོགས་འདུ] 1. The general name for the various types of Tibetan government assemblies. 2. Any assembly, e.g., the assembly (meeting) of monks in a college.">tsondu</a> 14 was convened. If there was big trouble then the Khamtsen 16 was convened. All the lists of the money, grain, oil, etc were with uchü, but we had no power. We only did accounting. All the power over these was with the chagbug. The abbot was involved since his Labrang <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཕྱག་མཛོད] A senior manager/treasurer of an aristocratic or monastic estate, or the senior manager/treasurer of an aristocratic family or a monastic unit.

They would ask the abbot briefly if we did this, was it okay, etc., and he would say yes if it's about loans and money etc. You needed a very good person for chagbug, but <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. སྒོ་མང] One of the large colleges in Drepung Monastery.">Gomang</a> didn't have these since the monks from Central Tibet <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. བོད་པ] 1.

It had a middle status of the types of lene. The chabril was also the one responsible for beating the gong at the tsog and chöra. The chabril got an extra share of gye in the tratsang.">chabril</a>, could only be böpa. The chabril was the one who keeps an eye on the chagbug but that was decided by seniority, mintsam and he had no influence or power. Even if he said something, they wouldn't listen.   

**Q:**  Did <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. དགེ་ཤེས] An advanced degree earned by scholar monks.">geshe</a> liked to go on büdü?   

**A:**  Some of them liked to go because of the receiving of rank later. Some of them didn't want to go since there was a risk to ones life. The danger was on the road. It was long. They carry 500 <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ད་ཡང; ch. 大洋] A Chinese silver dollar that had the image of Yuan Shikai on its face. It was used by the Chinese government in Tibet in the 1950s because Tibetans did not accept Chinese paper currency.">dayan</a> on each side, but these often break though. If you do well on büdü, the alms was 2 dayan and <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. གྲྭ་ཇ] The prayer session sponsored by the tratsang (college) at which tea was served to its monks who attended.">traja</a> and a good rice gruel (dotse 1000 cost). We sent someone continuously to these three areas. There have been many büdü who never came back. The Dragyun from Sogde and Dzogi [?] are our thabkung. So they had to come to Gomang.   

**Q:**  With alms did you give outside first or inside first?   

**A:**  In <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. སྒོ་མང] One of the large colleges in Drepung Monastery.">Gomang</a> Tratsang we didn't give the money outside. If there are monks outside waiting for alms, we brought them inside at the start of the 2 shaggag and gave them to the door. In the Tsogchen they gave gelen outside. In Gomang, even those outside had to wear their dagam. In the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཚོགས་ཆེན] The main assembly hall of a monastery. The assembly hall for the monastery as a whole.">tshogchen</a> they didn't have to wear dagam.   

**Q:**  He read their names?   

**A:**  No. The reading of names was for the special privilege ones. This he sits after the alms was given outside in the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. སྒོ་མཆོར] The area outside of the monastic assembly hall that is supported by tall pillars.">gomchor</a> and read their names and they came to get it.   

**Q:**  Can anyone not go to alms [?] and wait outside?   

**A:**  Yes. There was no asking of special permission. There weren't too many of these.   

**Q:**  Please explain about the salary?   

**A:**  In money salary (versus grain salary), the amount of extra shares was less. For example, the abbot got only 7 shares. The throne was about 40 shares. The <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. དགེ་སྐོས] The main disciplinary official in a monastic college (tratsang).">gegö</a> and umdze got three shares.   

**Q:**  Where did the money come from for salary?   

**A:**  The money for salary came from trust funds and surba [?] (people who give on the spot without leaving capital). There was a fixed schedule for this. For a one tranga distribution, have to give 50 <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. རྡོ་ཚད] A currency unit in traditional Tibet that was equal to 50 ngüsang.">dotse</a> in capital.   

**Q:**  Did the monks get 100-200 <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. སྲང] A unit of traditional Tibetan currency. It was also called ngüsang [tib. དངུལ་སྲང]. 50 nügsang = 1 dotse; 10 sho = 1 nügsang; 20 5-karma coins = 1 ngüsang. There were also paper currency notes of 7-sang, 25-sang, and 10-sang denominations.">sang</a> in salary a year?   

**A:**  No they got less. Salary was given under the gomchor. The <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. དབུ་མཛད] The name of the chant/prayer leader in a monastery.">Umdze</a> reads the monks name list. While this was being read the monks file through for their salary in one line. The monks know the order roughly. So they go through in that order of hierarchy, and there was really no direct correlation between monks line and the umdze's reading of the names. The amount of time taken to read the list was about the same time as saying the prayer for gyetong prayer. [i.e. long] With salary there are several "donations" for example, pendzö donation (for the expenses of printing books etc.), tsontsi donation (painting the pillars etc.), donation of gold, drangser (for putting new gold on face of gods), [Tib.དབྱར་གསོལ] donation (for giving food to enchöndze and monastic official when they went to do yarsol in Gadong every summer) and [Tib. ཚོགས་གདན] donation for (this was for new rugs in tshog). These donations had no fixed amounts to be distributed. It depended on how much the sponsor gave. These donations were collected by the chagbug and they gave the money to the uchö who held it for 6 months. At the end of the 6 months there was the uchö would settle the account called dumtsi (sdom rtsis) where the 7 Tratsang officials come. It took all day. The food for this was done in turns by the 7 monastic officials. They gave just food and tea, since it was money from private. Then after the 6 months, they give the money to each of the appropriate sections, e.g. library to library, the yarsö donation to the joint three ngünye; Tsondrü, Thonden and Seso. Money was given to the Chagbug. [436] The money that was held for 6 months was lent out on interest, and this interest was given to the monks as salary even if it was only a small amount. The sponsor couldn't give only to monks, he had to give to donation also, although there was no rule how much he had to give as donation.   

**Q:**  I heard there was special share of salary to the librarian?   

**A:**  If the salary comes from trust, then the 5 sources got 2-3 shares, although it was expressed as donation rather than salary. There was a fixed amount for this on all trust. If you were ex-official the salary distribution, the sponsor gave pretty much the same as the regular trust distributions were given.   

**Q:**  Did the monastic official Lama migtsemba and shunglemba get shares?   

**A:**  They were involved in tshogchen. They didn't get share. But Lama migtsemba comes from <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. སྒོ་མང] One of the large colleges in Drepung Monastery.">Gomang</a> so he may have gotten a share. I am not sure. It was said that they can get shares in all Tratsang, but in fact, I think they didn't.   

**Q:**  Was it in your list dose Lama migtsmema got share?   

**A:**  No it's not so he must not got Tratsang share. They may come in person to get, but they are not on the list of giving the share of alms. [Tib. སྐལ་གཏོང་རྩ་ཚིག]   

**Q:**  Some monks didn't have to come in person. It was the same for both alms and salary. Those who had the special right to get their share without coming, did so by sending gedrug etc?   

**A:**  For salary all the monks have to collect under the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. སྒོ་མཆོར] The area outside of the monastic assembly hall that is supported by tall pillars.">gomchor</a> before I started to read the list.   

**Q:**  How many enchöndze were there?   

**A:**  A little less than 200.   

**Q:**  What exactly was enchöndze?   

**A:**  Chöndze (about 100 of these), lama, <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. གཞུང] 1. A government. 2. The government of the Dalai Lama.">shung</a> shab (all the monk official in government whose thobkhung was Gomang), Barkhang <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཇོ་ཁང] A most famous temple in Lhasa that houses a holy statue of the Buddha.
