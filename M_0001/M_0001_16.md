**Q:**  What is the difference between the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. གཉེར་ཚང] 1. Storehouse. 2. Steward, person in charge of a storehouse. 3. A monastic official in charge of storerooms.">nyertsang</a> and <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཕྱག་སྦུག] A manager (of estates and endowments) of a monastic college or monastic khamtsen.">chabu</a> of <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. སྒོ་མང] One of the large colleges in Drepung Monastery.">Gomang</a> Tratsang (College)? How many <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. གཞིས་ཀ] A manorial estate.">shiga</a> (estates) were there under the nyertsang? Was it 6 or 4?   

**A:**  There were 6: Gyeba, [Tib. རྒྱས་པ] Shiga, Shangdön, [Tib. ?], Nambar [Tib.རྣམ་པར] Shiga, Nyemo Barthang Kharnga [Tib. སྙེ་མོ་བར་ཐང་མཁར་རྔ] Shiga, Nyemo Jangra, [Tib. ljangra] Shiga, Dzem Sanggar [Tib. 'dzems ?] Shiga. From these, Gyeba Shiga and Shangdön Shiga and the branch <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. གཞིས་ཀ] A manorial estate.">shiga</a> Gartog shiga were actually operated by the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. གཉེར་ཚང] 1. Storehouse. 2. Steward, person in charge of a storehouse. 3. A monastic official in charge of storerooms.">nyertsang</a> and the rest were lent out on lease. The oil for the New Year Losar cookies came from Nyemo Barthang Kharnga Shiga. From Jangra we got some tsamba. As for Dzem Sanggar Shiga, we gave beans as a loan to the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. མི་སེར] A term that can mean serf/bound subject as well as citizen, depending on context. For example, the miser of a lord would connote the bound subjects of that lord, whereas the miser of Tibet would connote citizens of Tibet.">miser</a> without interest starting from fist day of the 11th month and then in the spring we collected back wheat. This was called giving beans and collecting wheat, sentrödu, [Tib. སྲན་སྤྲོད་འབྲུ]. This shiga had 8 and a half <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཁྲལ་རྐང] The name of the basic tax unit for arable land in traditional Tibetan society. Families with farm land would have one or more fields of different sizes, e.g., 1 tregang or 1/2 of a tregang. This was defined by a fixed number of khe of seed (tib. sönkhe) that would be sown on that field. For example, one tregang in some areas would consist of 10 sönkhe. There was substantial variation between and within regions and types of estates.">tregang</a> [Tib. ཁྲལ་རྐང]. We got 1,000 <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཁལ] A traditional volume measurement used for measuring grain in traditional Tibetan society. Sizes of this unit varied somewhat, but the official government khe (called mkhar ru or bstan dzin mkha ru) weighed about 28-31 pounds for barley. It was used to convey the size of fields. For example, a field said to be 10 khe in size meant that 10 khe of seed could be sown on that field.">khe</a> of wheat which was divided among the miser and they had to mill it and bring it to the monastery to be used for making flour for the fried cookie, kabse [Tib. ཁ་ཟས].   

**Q:**  Did they have to work on the fields as an <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. འུལ་ལག] A generic term for corvée labor that had to be performed for one&#x27;s manorial estate/lord without pay. One kind of ula required people to go and work and another kind required the provision of transportation animals.">ula</a> in addition to this?   

**A:**  Yes. This was a tax for the monastery. They still had to work on the fields for the Shiga.   

**Q:**  Did you get the lease from the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. གཞིས་ཀ] A manorial estate.">shiga</a> in addition to this wheat?   

**A:**  Yes.   

**Q:**  Do you remember how many <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཁལ] A traditional volume measurement used for measuring grain in traditional Tibetan society. Sizes of this unit varied somewhat, but the official government khe (called mkhar ru or bstan dzin mkha ru) weighed about 28-31 pounds for barley. It was used to convey the size of fields. For example, a field said to be 10 khe in size meant that 10 khe of seed could be sown on that field.">khe</a> of land each <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. གཞིས་ཀ] A manorial estate.">shiga</a> had?   

**Q:**  No.   

**Q:**  Do you send the shidü to some <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. གཞིས་ཀ] A manorial estate.">shiga</a>?   

**A:**  Yes, we sent them to Gyeba and Shangdön.   

**Q:**  Did the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཕྱག་སྦུག] A manager (of estates and endowments) of a monastic college or monastic khamtsen.">chabu</a> have the authority over this?   

**A:**  No. The <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. གཉེར་ཚང] 1. Storehouse. 2. Steward, person in charge of a storehouse. 3. A monastic official in charge of storerooms.">nyertsang</a> had the complete authority over this.   

**Q:**  The <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. གཉེར་ཚང] 1. Storehouse. 2. Steward, person in charge of a storehouse. 3. A monastic official in charge of storerooms.">nyertsang</a> was run by the private, right?   

**A:**  Yes. Doing <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. གཉེར་ཚང] 1. Storehouse. 2. Steward, person in charge of a storehouse. 3. A monastic official in charge of storerooms.">nyertsang</a> was hard but not bad if there was a good harvest. My <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཤག་ཚང] 1. The household or family of a monk that consisted of multiple monks. 2. The apartment of a monk household.">shagtsang</a> held the nyertsang and the harvest was not good and had a very hard time because we had to supply the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. གྲྭ་ཇ] The prayer session sponsored by the tratsang (college) at which tea was served to its monks who attended.">traja</a> all the time. The benefit from doing nyertsang was that you got a right of <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཐོན] In monasteries, a title for monks who have finished their monastic job obligations (tib. ཐོན་ཟིན).">thön</a>, [Tib. ཐོན] after the nyertsang was done and you could become a <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. སྤྱི་བསོ] The head managers/stewards of monasteries as a whole, especially the large Gelugpa monasteries like Sera and Drepung.">jiso</a> candidate.   

**Q:**  Why was it different if you got a good crop or bad? What did you do with the grain?   

**A:**  We use the grain to buy butter for the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. གྲྭ་ཇ] The prayer session sponsored by the tratsang (college) at which tea was served to its monks who attended.">traja</a>, so it made a critical difference. We also got little bit butter from our nomad <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. མི་སེར] A term that can mean serf/bound subject as well as citizen, depending on context. For example, the miser of a lord would connote the bound subjects of that lord, whereas the miser of Tibet would connote citizens of Tibet.">miser</a> in Yangbajen, [Tib. ཡངས་པ་ཅན] where there were about 40-50 households of nomads. Even now it is called <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. སྒོ་མང] One of the large colleges in Drepung Monastery.">Gomang</a> Herd, [Tib. རུ་བ]. Then we also had nomad miser in Nyendrong [Tib. སྙན་གྲོང] where there were about 12-13 households it is the area just west of Damshung, [Tib. འདམ་གཞུང] and east of Yangpajen. Then in Chang Reting Kyangru [Tib. རྐྱང་རུ] we had little over 40 miser households. From these we got butter. Every 3 years we recounted the animals and recalculated the butter tax. From these we obtained about 500 <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཁལ] A traditional volume measurement used for measuring grain in traditional Tibetan society. Sizes of this unit varied somewhat, but the official government khe (called mkhar ru or bstan dzin mkha ru) weighed about 28-31 pounds for barley. It was used to convey the size of fields. For example, a field said to be 10 khe in size meant that 10 khe of seed could be sown on that field.">khe</a> of butter. We had some expenses at the time of calculation of animals. We had to give 5-6 khe of grain in Yangpajen and 5-6 of grain in Nyendrong to the tribe, tsopa to make <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. 1. ཆང, 2. བྱང] 1. Tibetan locally brewed barley beer. 2. North; nomad areas north of Lhasa in Nagchuga Prefecture 3. ch. 厂 factory.">chang</a> for the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. དཔོན་པོ, མངའ་བདག] 1. A manorial estate holder. 2. Chief of an area.">lord</a> of the tribe. There was a book that specified all these things; it was called [Tib. དེབ་སྦྱར]. At Kyangru we had to spend about 30-40 khe of <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. རྩམ་པ] The traditional Tibetan staple food that consists of grain that is roasted (popped), usually in heated sand, and then ground into a flour.">tsamba</a> on the nomads. For one week, each day each nomad miser got three ladle-full of tsamba and 3 teas per day. This was when we went to collect taxes. On the last day, we gave them <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཐུག་པ] 1. A porridge or gruel-like soup typically made with tsamba, and if available, meat and cheese. 2. Noodle dishes in broth.">thukpa</a> of roughly ground barley, yörey [Tib. ཡོས་རལ] and at night we give <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. བག་ཐུག] A soup that contains a mixture of tiny dough (flour) balls the size of a fingernail (and if available, cheese, meat, and radishes).">bagthug</a> with some meat. We also gave this to the beggars in this area. If they couldn't finish their thukpa they could take it home.   

**Q:**  Did the two <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. གཉེར་ཚང] 1. Storehouse. 2. Steward, person in charge of a storehouse. 3. A monastic official in charge of storerooms.">nyertsang</a> have to operate those two <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. གཞིས་ཀ] A manorial estate.">shiga</a> or could they lease it out?   

**A:**  It was our choice. We had complete authority over what to do. We got from it whatever the yield was. We appointed 2 monks to act as shidü from the east <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. གཉེར་ཚང] 1. Storehouse. 2. Steward, person in charge of a storehouse. 3. A monastic official in charge of storerooms.">nyertsang</a> and the west nyertsang. We paid them each 40 <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཁལ] A traditional volume measurement used for measuring grain in traditional Tibetan society. Sizes of this unit varied somewhat, but the official government khe (called mkhar ru or bstan dzin mkha ru) weighed about 28-31 pounds for barley. It was used to convey the size of fields. For example, a field said to be 10 khe in size meant that 10 khe of seed could be sown on that field.">khe</a> of barley per year as the salary. We also sent one monk when planting the field which was called söngyab, [Tib. སོན་རྒྱབ]. He and the 2 shidü had to settle how much seed should be planted. Then there was a person who checked the harvest called töngyab, [Tib. སྟོན་རྒྱབ] sent at harvest time. He stayed until the grain was harvested and stored in the granary.   

**Q:**  Where is Shangdön located?   

**A:**  It is located in Tölung Boma on this side of the river where there are lots of leopards.   

**Q:**  Being a shidü was not a monk's obligation called the tax of the lower garment, [Tib. ཤབ་ཐབ་ཀྱི་ཁྲལ], right?   

**A:**  Yes.   

**Q:**  Was it appointed or they have to request it?   

**A:**  The shidü were chosen by the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. གཉེར་ཚང] 1. Storehouse. 2. Steward, person in charge of a storehouse. 3. A monastic official in charge of storerooms.">nyertsang</a> from among their friends and trustworthy people who they thought were capable.   

**Q:**  Usually, the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. གཉེར་ཚང] 1. Storehouse. 2. Steward, person in charge of a storehouse. 3. A monastic official in charge of storerooms.">nyertsang</a> would buy butter with the grain they got from the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. གཞིས་ཀ] A manorial estate.">shiga</a> and if it was not enough, they had to add it, right?   

**A:**  Yes. At the normal <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. གྲྭ་ཇ] The prayer session sponsored by the tratsang (college) at which tea was served to its monks who attended.">traja</a>, we gave 4 teas each session, and use 4 <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཁལ] A traditional volume measurement used for measuring grain in traditional Tibetan society. Sizes of this unit varied somewhat, but the official government khe (called mkhar ru or bstan dzin mkha ru) weighed about 28-31 pounds for barley. It was used to convey the size of fields. For example, a field said to be 10 khe in size meant that 10 khe of seed could be sown on that field.">khe</a> of butter per tea or 16 khe of butter per sessions. The scale <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཉ་ག] A weight measurement unit. About 10 nyaga was equal to one gyama, which weighed 1.1 lbs.).">nyaga</a> was a little smaller than the others. And we use 8 bagjung for one tea. The tea was crumbled on the night before the traja and the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ནང་མ] A minor monk assistant to the Shengo at the Mönlam Chemmo Prayer Festival. These nangma ranked below the Chagdampa.">nangma</a>, <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. དགེ་སྐོས] The main disciplinary official in a monastic college (tratsang).">gegö</a>'s servant and a representative of the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. བླ་བྲང] 1. The property/wealth owning corporate entity of an incarnate lama. 2. The property/wealth owning corporate entity of the Panchen Lama.">labrang</a> had to be there watching. When the butter was weighed, a wooden seal was stamped on it. Then they put the tea in the caldron and covered the pot.   

**Q:**  Who did the work like smashing the tea leaves?   

**A:**  The <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. གཉེར་ཚང] 1. Storehouse. 2. Steward, person in charge of a storehouse. 3. A monastic official in charge of storerooms.">nyertsang</a>'s 2 inner <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. གཉེར་པ] A steward or manager. In some monasteries, the nyerpa was in charge of storerooms under the authority of a higher manager called a chandzö.">nyerpa</a>, nangnyer, [Tib. ནང་གཉེར] would check and weigh the butter. The checked tea was smashed on the square stone placed on the top of the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. སྒོ་མང] One of the large colleges in Drepung Monastery.">Gomang</a> Tratsang and then the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ནང་མ] A minor monk assistant to the Shengo at the Mönlam Chemmo Prayer Festival. These nangma ranked below the Chagdampa.">nangma</a> would put the tea in the cauldron, cover it and put a earthen seal on it and then the butter was sealed and carried back to the nyertsang for the night. The next day the nyertsang sent <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཐབ་གཡོག] Monks or laymen who work as servants/manual laborers in kitchens (normally monastic kitchens).">thabyog</a> to take the butter out of storeroom. At that time, the nyertsang sent one monk called martunga [Tib. མར་སྲུང་བ] to ensure that thabyog didn't steal butter when it was time to put it in.   

**Q:**  Would they send one of their <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. དགེ་ཕྲུག] 1. Student. 2. Disciple. 3. Commonly the name for monks living with a gegen or teacher. These are more like wards than real disciples.">gidru</a> to do this?   

**A:**  Yes.   

**Q:**  Who would make the fire?   

**A:**  The thabyog.   

**Q:**  Was there a storeroom of the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. གཉེར་ཚང] 1. Storehouse. 2. Steward, person in charge of a storehouse. 3. A monastic official in charge of storerooms.">nyertsang</a> different from that of the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཕྱག་སྦུག] A manager (of estates and endowments) of a monastic college or monastic khamtsen.">chabu</a>? And did you have a name for it?   

**A:**  Oh yes. We had totally separate storerooms. On the top of the stone stair, there is a long storeroom and on the other side, there was a storeroom called Namsekhang [Tib. རྣམ་སྲས་ཁང] where we store the butter and this is called Jishung [Tib. སྤྱི་གཞུང] Nyertsang. In these, we mainly stored butter and below that there was the storeroom of the west nyetysang. We would take some from these storerooms and then move it to the kitchen, <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. རུང་ཁང] A monastic kitchen.">rungkhang</a> which is also called Jishung Rungkhang.   

**Q:**  Did the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. གཉེར་ཚང] 1. Storehouse. 2. Steward, person in charge of a storehouse. 3. A monastic official in charge of storerooms.">nyertsang</a> have a cashier?   

**A:**  No. In addition to the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. གྲྭ་ཇ] The prayer session sponsored by the tratsang (college) at which tea was served to its monks who attended.">traja</a>, we also had to serve butter tea to the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཕྱག་སྦུག] A manager (of estates and endowments) of a monastic college or monastic khamtsen.">chabu</a> everyday. There was also a <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. མགོན་ཁང] A chapel devoted to a protector deity.">gönkhang</a>. In the gönkhang there were 9 monks doing the ritual for propitiating,[Tib. བསྐངས་བསོ] the protective deity Maha Kala, Gompo,[Tib. མགོན་པོ] every day. 4 of these were from <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. བླ་བྲང] 1. The property/wealth owning corporate entity of an incarnate lama. 2. The property/wealth owning corporate entity of the Panchen Lama.">labrang</a> and 4 from nyertsnag and 1 from Kündeling, [Tib. ཀུན་བདེ་གླིང] Labrang whose salary was also paid by the Kündeling. Everyday, we had to give our 4 monks a large iron ladle full [Tib. ལྕགས་གསར] of <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. རྩམ་པ] The traditional Tibetan staple food that consists of grain that is roasted (popped), usually in heated sand, and then ground into a flour.">tsamba</a> and the monks would put the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. རྩམ་པ] The traditional Tibetan staple food that consists of grain that is roasted (popped), usually in sand, and then ground into a flour.">tsampa</a> in their wooden container called, pagphor, [Tib. སྤགས་ཕོར]. And we also gave a lesser amount of tsampa to all the nine monks and serve tea to all of them. Sometimes the labrang served the tea, but mostly we did.   

**Q:**  How were the storerooms opened and locked?   

**A:**  Each nangnyer had his own lock and both of them were needed to open the store.   

**Q:**  What was the term of <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཕྱག་སྦུག] A manager (of estates and endowments) of a monastic college or monastic khamtsen.">chabu</a> and <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. གཉེར་ཚང] 1. Storehouse. 2. Steward, person in charge of a storehouse. 3. A monastic official in charge of storerooms.">nyertsang</a>?   

**A:**  Nyertsang was 3 years, the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཕྱག་སྦུག] A manager (of estates and endowments) of a monastic college or monastic khamtsen.">chabu</a> had no fixed term and it depended on the ability of the chabu. Samlo, Hamdong and Gungru had many <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཚོགས་འདུ] 1. The general name for the various types of Tibetan government assemblies. 2. Any assembly, e.g., the assembly (meeting) of monks in a college.">tsondu</a> members, but Badi had only about 10 monks in 1959 and there were not tsondu members. So whether their chabu was capable or not, we had to leave him there. So for the Badi, their chabu would stay there for years since they had no one else to substitute.   

**Q:**  Who selected the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. གཉེར་ཚང] 1. Storehouse. 2. Steward, person in charge of a storehouse. 3. A monastic official in charge of storerooms.">nyertsang</a>?   

**A:**  The <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. བླ་བྲང] 1. The property/wealth owning corporate entity of an incarnate lama. 2. The property/wealth owning corporate entity of the Panchen Lama.">labrang</a> abbot put forward the candidate of the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. གཉེར་ཚང] 1. Storehouse. 2. Steward, person in charge of a storehouse. 3. A monastic official in charge of storerooms.">nyertsang</a> internally, but probably, it was appointed by the government. I don't remember clearly.   

**Q:**  We heard that it was just namely appointed by the government, but they would appoint the candidate that was submitted. Was the candidate put forward by the abbot?   

**A:**  Yes.   

**Q:**  Was there the custom of bribing the abbot?   

**A:**  Yes there was. The abbot also appoints the umdze and <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. དགེ་སྐོས] The main disciplinary official in a monastic college (tratsang).">gegö</a>, but the abbot had to ask the monk to be gegö, since no one wanted to do it.   

**Q:**  The <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. དགེ་སྐོས] The main disciplinary official in a monastic college (tratsang).">gegö</a> had the power. Why didn't the monks want to do this?   

**A:**  The <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. དགེ་སྐོས] The main disciplinary official in a monastic college (tratsang).">gegö</a> gets 11 additional alms share and the term is for 6 months and at the end he would have to pay each monk like 1-2 <a href="#" data-tooltip="[ch. 毛] A Chinese currency unit. 10 maotse = 1 yuan. 10 fen = one maotse.">maotse</a> which was called, the substitute of <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཐུག་པ] 1. A porridge or gruel-like soup typically made with tsamba, and if available, meat and cheese. 2. Noodle dishes in broth.">thukpa</a>, [Tib. ཐུག་དོད] and in the past it was like 1-3 <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཞོ] A unit in the traditional Tibetan currency system. 10 sho equaled to 1 sang and 10 karma equaled one sho.">sho</a> and also have to serve tea to the monks. According to our custom, during the summer retreat, [Tib. དབྱར་ཆོས] the gegö should be a <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. བླ་རྒྱུད་པ] A term for the common monks in a monastery (in contrast to the scholar monks who were actively studying the Buddhist doctrine).">lagyüba</a> and in winter it was <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. དཔེ་ཆ་བ] A monk studying the monastic philosophical curriculum. A scholar monk.">pechawa</a>. When I was small there was no difference of summer and winter. It didn't matter whether the gegö was bechawa and lagyüpa. But in winter, there was a class called thug <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཆོས་ར] The special grove (&quot;dharma grove&quot;) in monasteries where monks formally met to practice debating.">chöra</a>, [Tib. ཐུགས་ཆོས་ར] where the lagyüba gegö didn't understand how to do that because it was very complicated one and the gegö went back to the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. 1. ཤག, 2. ཞག] 1. The apartment/room of a monk. 2. The butter fat that coagulates on the top of butter-tea when the tea is left to sit for some time. If the tea had been made with a lot of butter, this layer could be thick enough to scoop off and save to later sell or eat separately. The senior monks are usually served tea with a lot of shag.">shag</a> after the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. གྲྭ་ཇ] The prayer session sponsored by the tratsang (college) at which tea was served to its monks who attended.">traja</a> was over and the umdze had to do this. Therefore, they found that they needed a pechawa and since then, they changed the rule.   

**Q:**  Did the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. གཉེར་ཚང] 1. Storehouse. 2. Steward, person in charge of a storehouse. 3. A monastic official in charge of storerooms.">nyertsang</a> bribe the abbot?   

**A:**  Yes, but there was no fixed amount and 1-2 <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. རྡོ་ཚད] A currency unit in traditional Tibet that was equal to 50 ngüsang.">dotse</a> was okay as there wasn't so much rushing [Tib. འཚང་ཁ] for the position. There was also not much rushing for the umdze position. When I became umdze, there were at first 25 monks who wanted it. First they held a competition of voice. Then after comparing the voice etc., these were reduced to 5 candidates and then they did the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཟན་རིལ] A divine lottery. Multiple answers to a question were written on paper of the same size and rolled in dough balls of the same size and weight. These were shaken in a plate or bowl in front of a statue of a deity until one of the balls popped out. The ball that popped out was considered to have been selected by the deity before which the lottery was done.">senriy</a> in front of the Deity Gompo and my name came out. There was no custom of selecting <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. གཉེར་ཚང] 1. Storehouse. 2. Steward, person in charge of a storehouse. 3. A monastic official in charge of storerooms.">nyertsang</a> by senriy.

**Q:**  If you didn't become a <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. གཉེར་ཚང] 1. Storehouse. 2. Steward, person in charge of a storehouse. 3. A monastic official in charge of storerooms.">nyertsang</a>, you will not become <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. སྤྱི་བསོ] The head managers/stewards of monasteries as a whole, especially the large Gelugpa monasteries like Sera and Drepung.">jiso</a>, right?   

**A:**  Yes.   

**Q:**  Was there a senior and junior <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. གཉེར་ཚང] 1. Storehouse. 2. Steward, person in charge of a storehouse. 3. A monastic official in charge of storerooms.">nyertsang</a>?   

**Q:**  Yes. There was east and west nyertsang. The east was considered senior and west as junior.   

**Q:**  What else does the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. གཉེར་ཚང] 1. Storehouse. 2. Steward, person in charge of a storehouse. 3. A monastic official in charge of storerooms.">nyertsang</a> do besides serving the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. གྲྭ་ཇ] The prayer session sponsored by the tratsang (college) at which tea was served to its monks who attended.">traja</a>? Did they have to give alms?   

**A:**  They have something to do like paying little bit money salary. There is an endowment [Tib. ཐེབ་རྩ] for this that they give loans and use the interest for the salary.   

**Q:**  Then they needed to have a cashier, right?   

**A:**  No, they didn't need it.   

**Q:**  Who kept the money?   

**A:**  They divided the money among the two nyertsang. They then lend this and the capital is used for the money salary.   

**Q:**  How much of an endowment did they have? Was it like 100-200 <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. རྡོ་ཚད] A currency unit in traditional Tibet that was equal to 50 ngüsang.">dotse</a>?   

**A:**  I don't remember how much the endowment, <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཐེབས་རྩ] An endowment fund.">thebtsa</a>, [Tib. ཐེབ་རྩ] was but from 50 <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. རྡོ་ཚད] A currency unit in traditional Tibet that was equal to 50 ngüsang.">dotse</a> in the thebtsa, the monks get 1 <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཏམ་ཀ] A unit in the traditional Tibetan currency system that was equal to 4 sang.">tranka</a> each.   

**Q:**  Were there about 4,000 monks?   

**A:**  There was more than 5,000 monks. The amount of the endowment was like early time and it was not allowed to increase it. Probably, the endowment was 2,500 <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. སྲང] A unit of traditional Tibetan currency. It was also called ngüsang [tib. དངུལ་སྲང]. 50 nügsang = 1 dotse; 10 sho = 1 nügsang; 20 5-karma coins = 1 ngüsang. There were also paper currency notes of 7-sang, 25-sang, and 10-sang denominations.">sang</a> = 50 dotse.   

**Q:**  Was there a limit for the interest when they give loans?   

**A:**  We lent it out at 20% interest, [Tib. བཅུ་སྐྱེད] although the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. གྲྭ་ཚང] A &quot;college&quot; within a monastery, for example, in Drepung Monastery there were four main tratsang: Gomang, Loseling, Deyang and Ngagpa. These tratsang were property owning corporate entities and included monks who were organized into residential dormitories called Khamtsen.">tratsang</a>'s endowment rate was 16% [Tib. བརྒྱད་སྐྱེད] interest.   

**Q:**  How did they use this money profit they get from the difference between the interest?   

**A:**  The <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. གཉེར་ཚང] 1. Storehouse. 2. Steward, person in charge of a storehouse. 3. A monastic official in charge of storerooms.">nyertsang</a> got this profit and in the future and it was okay if you could hand over the capital. When we finished doing the nyertsang, we couldn't hand over the capital.   

**Q:**  At that time, didn't the debtors pay you the capital back?   

**Q:**  They paid the loan, but the expenses of the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. གཉེར་ཚང] 1. Storehouse. 2. Steward, person in charge of a storehouse. 3. A monastic official in charge of storerooms.">nyertsang</a> was too much, so we had to borrow money from others to hand over the capital. At that time, we were made to suffer very much because the next one was a <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. དགེ་ཕྲུག] 1. Student. 2. Disciple. 3. Commonly the name for monks living with a gegen or teacher. These are more like wards than real disciples.">gidru</a> of <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. སྤྱི་བསོ] The head managers/stewards of monasteries as a whole, especially the large Gelugpa monasteries like Sera and Drepung.">jiso</a> nicknamed, "the tiger with torn up mouth, Takhare, [Tib. སྟག་ཁརལ]. I heard that when we became the nyertsang, it caused a great harm to Takhare, when we did the nyertsang because the Takare had to spend a lot for bribing. That's why they held the grudge though we didn't ask for the jiso because we were not capable of doing that.   

**Q:**  Was there anything to do with the crops?   

**Q:**  Yes the yield was also not that good.   

**Q:**  Was there any other expenditures?   

**A:**  We had to buy 500 <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཁལ] A traditional volume measurement used for measuring grain in traditional Tibetan society. Sizes of this unit varied somewhat, but the official government khe (called mkhar ru or bstan dzin mkha ru) weighed about 28-31 pounds for barley. It was used to convey the size of fields. For example, a field said to be 10 khe in size meant that 10 khe of seed could be sown on that field.">khe</a> of butter because we have to spend 1,000 khe. And the butter was expensive. Later, it was 50 <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. སྲང] A unit of traditional Tibetan currency. It was also called ngüsang [tib. དངུལ་སྲང]. 50 nügsang = 1 dotse; 10 sho = 1 nügsang; 20 5-karma coins = 1 ngüsang. There were also paper currency notes of 7-sang, 25-sang, and 10-sang denominations.">sang</a> for khe of butter where in the past, it was not that expensive.   

**Q:**  Did the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. གཉེར་ཚང] 1. Storehouse. 2. Steward, person in charge of a storehouse. 3. A monastic official in charge of storerooms.">nyertsang</a> have animals to be leased?   

**Q:**  No we didn't. We collected the butter from the nomads. We also had some income from the forced selling, bamtsong pügyur, [Tib. འབམ་ཚོང་སྤུས་སྒྱུར]. We gave them 60 <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཁ་བཏགས] A Tibetan ceremonial scarf given to lamas, visitors, etc.">khata</a> and they gave us 2 <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. བྲེ] A unit of traditional volume measurement [a container] in Tibet, 20 of which typically equaled one khe or bo [also a container], although in some areas there were only 16 dre in one khe.">dre</a> of dried cheese for each khata.

We get about 8 <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཁལ] A traditional volume measurement used for measuring grain in traditional Tibetan society.

But I did three years more and then I got into trouble like the proverb, "the water pit covered with hay." [Tib. ཕུག་མའི་འོག་གི་ཆུ་དོང] When we sent the butter load to the nyertsang we would have to weigh it again in Lhasa. I did the job very honestly. When I received the butter from the nomads, if the leather for wrapping the butter is dry, I weigh it as it is and if the leather is wet, I would always reduce the weight of the wet leather. So from the next year they would not use the wet leather,

The children of human lease peasants inherited this status from parents of the same sex (i.e. sons of a male belonged to their father&#x27;s lord).">mibo</a>?   

**A:**  We did it by ourself and the nyertysang had the authority to permit the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. མི་བོགས] A status wherein a peasant &quot;leased&quot; his/her &quot;freedom&quot; from his/her lord to live and work where he/she wanted.

The children of human lease peasants inherited this status from parents of the same sex (i.e. sons of a male belonged to their father&#x27;s lord).">mibo</a> and we collect the mibo.   

**Q:**  Usually, did they pay you the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. མི་བོགས] A status wherein a peasant &quot;leased&quot; his/her &quot;freedom&quot; from his/her lord to live and work where he/she wanted. The peasants with human lease status still belonged to their lord and were required to pay an annual fee (&quot;human lease fee&quot;) to their lord. The children of human lease peasants inherited this status from parents of the same sex (i.e. sons of a male belonged to their father&#x27;s lord).">mibo</a>?   

**A:**  Yes they did. But there were very few who requested to pay their <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. མི་བོགས] A status wherein a peasant &quot;leased&quot; his/her &quot;freedom&quot; from his/her lord to live and work where he/she wanted.

**Q:**  Were there people who came out side and stayed there and paid the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. མི་བོགས] A status wherein a peasant &quot;leased&quot; his/her &quot;freedom&quot; from his/her lord to live and work where he/she wanted.

The children of human lease peasants inherited this status from parents of the same sex (i.e. sons of a male belonged to their father&#x27;s lord).">mibo</a>?   

**A:**  No. Mainly the shidü handled this matter and they didn't give much permission to pay the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. མི་བོགས] A status wherein a peasant &quot;leased&quot; his/her &quot;freedom&quot; from his/her lord to live and work where he/she wanted.

**Q:**  What happened when families split and two sons take their bride, were they allowed to divide the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཁྲལ་རྐང] The name of the basic tax unit for arable land in traditional Tibetan society. Families with farm land would have one or more fields of different sizes, e.g., 1 tregang or 1/2 of a tregang. This was defined by a fixed number of khe of seed (tib. sönkhe) that would be sown on that field. For example, one tregang in some areas would consist of 10 sönkhe. There was substantial variation between and within regions and types of estates.">tregang</a>?   

**A:**  These are decided by the shidü. We did have one case in Yangbachen. A big family mother and father were getting into fight and the kids split into two groups also. Whatever divided advice we gave them they wouldn't listen and said they want to divide. So in the end, all the animals and things were divided. At this time they gave the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. གཉེར་ཚང] 1. Storehouse. 2. Steward, person in charge of a storehouse. 3. A monastic official in charge of storerooms.">nyertsang</a> 4-5 best female yak as the offering for dividing, göpu, [Tib. བགོས་ཕུད].

The children of human lease peasants inherited this status from parents of the same sex (i.e. sons of a male belonged to their father&#x27;s lord).">mibo</a>, would he be allowed to do that?   

**A:**  Most probably not allowed among the farmers except the chödrö.   

**Q:**  Did he have to ask for the permission to get married?   

**A:**  The shiü would make all the decision and he would say that he had all the authority of the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. གཞིས་ཀ] A manorial estate.">shiga</a> since he paid the lease.   

**Q:**  What did the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཕྱག་སྦུག] A manager (of estates and endowments) of a monastic college or monastic khamtsen.">chabu</a> do?

**Q:**  The <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཕྱག་སྦུག] A manager (of estates and endowments) of a monastic college or monastic khamtsen.">chabu</a> gave a lot of grain loans, right?   

**A:**  All these loans were given by <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཕྱག་སྦུག] A manager (of estates and endowments) of a monastic college or monastic khamtsen.">chabu</a>. I recall that the capital was about 100,000 <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཁལ] A traditional volume measurement used for measuring grain in traditional Tibetan society.

I don't recall all this now, but there was a book in which all of these were written. And the main tongdeb would be kept by the uchö. After the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཆོས་ར] The special grove (&quot;dharma grove&quot;) in monasteries where monks formally met to practice debating.">chöra</a> was over then the chabu and the uchö meet and looked in this book, then we, the uchö would give the chabu sealed receipt saying on such and such a date the donggo was done and if the donggo is not given, then we would make a note of it.

For example, a field said to be 10 khe in size meant that 10 khe of seed could be sown on that field.">khe</a> of grain salary, right?   

**A:**  Yes. And the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཕྱག་སྦུག] A manager (of estates and endowments) of a monastic college or monastic khamtsen.">chabu</a> also had the grain capital for paying the salary. Once when they did the accounting, they found that the chabu had about 200,000-300 000 <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཁལ] A traditional volume measurement used for measuring grain in traditional Tibetan society.

For example, a field said to be 10 khe in size meant that 10 khe of seed could be sown on that field.">khe</a> of the grain. They had to submit the account to the government once every three years. But not too long before the revolt the common monks petitioned to have another accounting to see how much was really there and they said that they wanted the chabu to give more grain salary]. The monks said if there is a lot of grain we should get more grain salary. This went to the Branch Judicial System for settling the disputes, [Tib. གྱོད་ཞིབ] and they sent officials and did a detailed accounting, but they just did it according to the total number of grain we put under the account. Otherwise, they couldn't do the accounting one by one. And they did the accounting in the expenses of the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. གྲྭ་ཚང] A &quot;college&quot; within a monastery, for example, in Drepung Monastery there were four main tratsang: Gomang, Loseling, Deyang and Ngagpa.

For example, a field said to be 10 khe in size meant that 10 khe of seed could be sown on that field.">khe</a>, so wasn't the expenses kind of small amount?

**A:**  It was independent. They had three units which were completely separate from <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. གཉེར་ཚང] 1. Storehouse. 2. Steward, person in charge of a storehouse. 3. A monastic official in charge of storerooms.">nyertsang</a> and chabu. There was a two joint nyidrel, [Tib. ཉིས་སྦྲེལ] and three joint, sumdrel, [Tib. སུམ་སྦྲེལ] and four joint, shidrel, [Tib. བཞི་སྦྲེལ]. They had their own tongdeb listing their duties. The <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. དངུལ་གཉེར] Accountant, bookkeeper, cashier. Someone in charge of cash.">ngünyer</a> sumdrel was also called chibgyur ngünyer, [Tib. ཆིབས་སྒྱུར་དངུལ་གཉེར] because it was in charge of the accommodation when the Dalai Lama visits Drepung.   

**Q:**  Who would appoint the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. དངུལ་གཉེར] Accountant, bookkeeper, cashier. Someone in charge of cash.">ngünyer</a>? The <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཕྱག་སྦུག] A manager (of estates and endowments) of a monastic college or monastic khamtsen.">chabu</a> or the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཚོགས་འདུ] 1. The general name for the various types of Tibetan government assemblies. 2. Any assembly, e.g., the assembly (meeting) of monks in a college.">tsondu</a>? ngünyer?   

**A:**  They were appointed by the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཕྱག་སྦུག] A manager (of estates and endowments) of a monastic college or monastic khamtsen.">chabu</a> alone. But at one it was hard to find people doing <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. དངུལ་གཉེར] Accountant, bookkeeper, cashier. Someone in charge of cash.">ngünyer</a>, so the chabu started a new custom of the ngünyer getting <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཐོན] In monasteries, a title for monks who have finished their monastic job obligations (tib. ཐོན་ཟིན).">thön</a> and being able to wear resom, [Tib. རས་ཟོམ] boots.

**Q:**  People say that the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཕྱག་སྦུག] A manager (of estates and endowments) of a monastic college or monastic khamtsen.">chabu</a> was powerful, but actually what kind of the power did it have?

A monastic official in charge of storerooms.">nyertsang</a> did their own job, right?   

**A:**  The <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཕྱག་སྦུག] A manager (of estates and endowments) of a monastic college or monastic khamtsen.">chabu</a>'s power was to embezzle the wealth of the tratsang. When the chabu meets, they definitely ate one meal and sometimes two and the tea was served all the time. Regularly, there were the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. བླ་བྲང] 1.

**Q:**  When the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཕྱག་སྦུག] A manager (of estates and endowments) of a monastic college or monastic khamtsen.">chabu</a> meet, what do they discuss and decide?   

**A:**  They dealt with all the matters about their <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. མི་སེར] A term that can mean serf/bound subject as well as citizen, depending on context. For example, the miser of a lord would connote the bound subjects of that lord, whereas the miser of Tibet would connote citizens of Tibet.">miser</a>, like giving the chödrö. And <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཕྱག་སྦུག] A manager (of estates and endowments) of a monastic college or monastic khamtsen.">chabu</a> did all the administrative works like renovating the tratsang.   

**Q:**  But they did not deal with the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. མི་སེར] A term that can mean serf/bound subject as well as citizen, depending on context. For example, the miser of a lord would connote the bound subjects of that lord, whereas the miser of Tibet would connote citizens of Tibet.">miser</a> under the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. གཉེར་ཚང] 1. Storehouse. 2. Steward, person in charge of a storehouse. 3. A monastic official in charge of storerooms.">nyertsang</a>, right?   

**A:**  Yes.   

**Q:**  What other power did they have?   

**A:**  They did all the work in the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. གྲྭ་ཚང] A &quot;college&quot; within a monastery, for example, in Drepung Monastery there were four main tratsang: Gomang, Loseling, Deyang and Ngagpa. These tratsang were property owning corporate entities and included monks who were organized into residential dormitories called Khamtsen.">tratsang</a> like buying things and making the religious decorations for the tratsang.   

**Q:**  Did the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཕྱག་སྦུག] A manager (of estates and endowments) of a monastic college or monastic khamtsen.">chabu</a> have nomads?

**Q:**  Did the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཕྱག་སྦུག] A manager (of estates and endowments) of a monastic college or monastic khamtsen.">chabu</a> take care of renovating the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. གྲྭ་ཚང] A &quot;college&quot; within a monastery, for example, in Drepung Monastery there were four main tratsang: Gomang, Loseling, Deyang and Ngagpa. These tratsang were property owning corporate entities and included monks who were organized into residential dormitories called Khamtsen.">tratsang</a>?   

**A:**  Yes.   

**Q:**  So the money of the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. དངུལ་གཉེར] Accountant, bookkeeper, cashier. Someone in charge of cash.">ngünyer</a> was used for paying the salary, right?   

**A:**  Yes. Because the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. དངུལ་གཉེར] Accountant, bookkeeper, cashier. Someone in charge of cash.">ngünyer</a> got the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཐོན] In monasteries, a title for monks who have finished their monastic job obligations (tib. ཐོན་ཟིན).">thön</a> when they terminated, they gave the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. གྲྭ་ཚང] A &quot;college&quot; within a monastery, for example, in Drepung Monastery there were four main tratsang: Gomang, Loseling, Deyang and Ngagpa. These tratsang were property owning corporate entities and included monks who were organized into residential dormitories called Khamtsen.">tratsang</a> gifts. For example the chibgyur ngünyer made many religious decorations like covering the pillars. They would also ask for some different kind of donations like the donation for the summer propitiating the deities, yarsöl, [Tib. གཡར་གསོལ] etc. In fact, the ngünyer sumdre usually didn't just lend out money they engage in trade so that they could get some extra profit to leave for the monastery.   

**Q:**  Did you ever use the extra money for adding it on the capital?   

**A:**  No. The <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. དངུལ་གཉེར] Accountant, bookkeeper, cashier. Someone in charge of cash.">ngünyer</a> would save the extra money and give loans and when you get the interest; they added it on the capital.   

**Q:**  Did they ever think of adding the extra on the endowments?   

**A:**  No. At one time there were many monks doing <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. གྲྭ་ཚང] A &quot;college&quot; within a monastery, for example, in Drepung Monastery there were four main tratsang: Gomang, Loseling, Deyang and Ngagpa. These tratsang were property owning corporate entities and included monks who were organized into residential dormitories called Khamtsen.">tratsang</a> <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཆོས་མཛད] The title of monks who made a payment or gave gifts to secure exemption from the normal &quot;young monk&quot; work obligations. There were tratsang chöndze and khamtsen chöndze.">chöndze</a>. The reason was that in <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. སྒོ་མང] One of the large colleges in Drepung Monastery.">Gomang</a> they had to serve only one <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. གྲྭ་ཇ] The prayer session sponsored by the tratsang (college) at which tea was served to its monks who attended.">traja</a> and they use only 2-3 <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཁལ] A traditional volume measurement used for measuring grain in traditional Tibetan society. Sizes of this unit varied somewhat, but the official government khe (called mkhar ru or bstan dzin mkha ru) weighed about 28-31 pounds for barley. It was used to convey the size of fields. For example, a field said to be 10 khe in size meant that 10 khe of seed could be sown on that field.">khe</a> of butter. They had to offer 1,000 butter lamps in front of Tsongkhapa. But later some chöndze stopped offering the butter lamp. So later the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཕྱག་སྦུག] A manager (of estates and endowments) of a monastic college or monastic khamtsen.">chabu</a> made a new rule. It said that they have to offer 1,000 butter lamps or leave an endowment, bungjog, [Tib. སྦུག་འཇོག] of 50 <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. རྡོ་ཚད] A currency unit in traditional Tibet that was equal to 50 ngüsang.">dotse</a> to the tratsang for giving one <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཏམ་ཀ] A unit in the traditional Tibetan currency system that was equal to 4 sang.">tranka</a> alms for each monk. In the past, the bungjog was 7 dotse. And they also have to use 8 khe of butter on the traja. But even after this there were many chöndze giving the tonggo. In the past, the uchö and the tratsang jama had to go to <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. 1. ཤག, 2. ཞག] 1. The apartment/room of a monk. 2. The butter fat that coagulates on the top of butter-tea when the tea is left to sit for some time. If the tea had been made with a lot of butter, this layer could be thick enough to scoop off and save to later sell or eat separately. The senior monks are usually served tea with a lot of shag.">shag</a> of the chöndze and weigh the butter and tea. But later they didn't do that.   

**Q:**  If some sponsors like a <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཚོགས་ཆེན] The main assembly hall of a monastery. The assembly hall for the monastery as a whole.">tsogchen</a> trüku wanted to leave an endowment who would make the division? Was it the nyertysang or the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཕྱག་སྦུག] A manager (of estates and endowments) of a monastic college or monastic khamtsen.">chabu</a>?   

**A:**  It was up to the sponsor and some leave a lot for the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. གྲྭ་ཚང] A &quot;college&quot; within a monastery, for example, in Drepung Monastery there were four main tratsang: Gomang, Loseling, Deyang and Ngagpa. These tratsang were property owning corporate entities and included monks who were organized into residential dormitories called Khamtsen.">tratsang</a>. They would give the alms on that day and they would write in the list of requesting prayers, kyabtho [Tib. སྐྱབ་ཐོ] that they would leave the endowment to the tratsang or <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. དངུལ་གཉེར] Accountant, bookkeeper, cashier. Someone in charge of cash.">ngünyer</a> etc whatever they liked.   

**Q:**  Who selected the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. སྤྱི་བསོ] The head managers/stewards of monasteries as a whole, especially the large Gelugpa monasteries like Sera and Drepung.">jiso</a> candidates?   

**A:**  Probably, the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. བླ་བྲང] 1. The property/wealth owning corporate entity of an incarnate lama. 2. The property/wealth owning corporate entity of the Panchen Lama.">labrang</a> selected. I am not sure.   

**Q:**  The <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. སྤྱི་བསོ] The head managers/stewards of monasteries as a whole, especially the large Gelugpa monasteries like Sera and Drepung.">jiso</a> term was 10 years, right?   

**A:**  Yes.   

**Q:**  So there would be the three candidates for each <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. སྤྱི་བསོ] The head managers/stewards of monasteries as a whole, especially the large Gelugpa monasteries like Sera and Drepung.">jiso</a>, right?   

**A:**  Yes.   

**Q:**  Did the candidates go according to the seniority or did they just select them?   

**A:**  They selected them. If some one was the incumbent <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. གཉེར་ཚང] 1. Storehouse. 2. Steward, person in charge of a storehouse. 3. A monastic official in charge of storerooms.">nyertsang</a>, he would become the first candidate of the jiso.   

**Q:**  Who would select the candidates? Was it the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. བླ་བྲང] 1. The property/wealth owning corporate entity of an incarnate lama. 2. The property/wealth owning corporate entity of the Panchen Lama.">labrang</a> or the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཕྱག་སྦུག] A manager (of estates and endowments) of a monastic college or monastic khamtsen.">chabu</a>?   

**A:**  Maybe the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. བླ་བྲང] 1. The property/wealth owning corporate entity of an incarnate lama. 2. The property/wealth owning corporate entity of the Panchen Lama.">labrang</a> and <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཕྱག་སྦུག] A manager (of estates and endowments) of a monastic college or monastic khamtsen.">chabu</a> did it jointly. I was among the candidates twice, but I don't remember clearly. Later, the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. སྤྱི་བསོ] The head managers/stewards of monasteries as a whole, especially the large Gelugpa monasteries like Sera and Drepung.">jiso</a> was run by the monastery itself, [Tib. གཞུང་འཛིན] and they could do it just for 2 years. Trindor: But each jiso kept three <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. གཞིས་ཀ] A manorial estate.">shiga</a> for themselves. [laughter]   

**Q:**  I heard from somebody that the monastery as a whole was called <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཚོགས་ཆེན] The main assembly hall of a monastery. The assembly hall for the monastery as a whole.">tsogchen</a>, is this correct?   

**A:**  Yes. The <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཚོགས་ཆེན] The main assembly hall of a monastery. The assembly hall for the monastery as a whole.">tshogchen</a> was the place where all the monks of the monastery assemble and the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. མང་ཇ] The morning tea served to monks from all the monastic colleges at the main prayer assembly hall.">mangja</a> was also served by the government. So it was something like the whole monastery was also called tsogchen. But if you say Drepung, then the whole monastery is included.   

**Q:**  For example, if I say that there are many monastic officials, <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ལས་སྣེ] The general name for all monastic officials.">lene</a>, [Tib. ལས་སྣེ] in the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཚོགས་ཆེན] The main assembly hall of a monastery. The assembly hall for the monastery as a whole.">tsogchen</a>, how would people understand it?   

**A:**  If you say this, the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ལས་སྣེ] The general name for all monastic officials.">lene</a> of the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. གྲྭ་ཚང] A &quot;college&quot; within a monastery, for example, in Drepung Monastery there were four main tratsang: Gomang, Loseling, Deyang and Ngagpa. These tratsang were property owning corporate entities and included monks who were organized into residential dormitories called Khamtsen.">tratsang</a> was not included in this. Actually, <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཚོགས་ཆེན] The main assembly hall of a monastery. The assembly hall for the monastery as a whole.">tsogchen</a> means the big assembly hall and doesn't have other meanings.   

**Q:**  Would the laji and the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. སྤྱི་བསོ] The head managers/stewards of monasteries as a whole, especially the large Gelugpa monasteries like Sera and Drepung.">jiso</a> include in the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཚོགས་ཆེན] The main assembly hall of a monastery. The assembly hall for the monastery as a whole.">tsogchen</a>?   

**A:**  Yes. <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. སྤྱི་བསོ] The head managers/stewards of monasteries as a whole, especially the large Gelugpa monasteries like Sera and Drepung.">jiso</a> belonged to laji. The main in charge of the laji are the abbots.   

**Q:**  If you said the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ལས་སྣེ] The general name for all monastic officials.">lene</a> of the Drepung, this includes all the lene and how about if you say <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཚོགས་ཆེན] The main assembly hall of a monastery. The assembly hall for the monastery as a whole.">tsogchen</a> lene?   

**A:**  If you say <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཚོགས་ཆེན] The main assembly hall of a monastery. The assembly hall for the monastery as a whole.">tsogchen</a> <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ལས་སྣེ] The general name for all monastic officials.">lene</a>, now people might understand it is the shengo. If you say <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. དགེ་སྐོས] The main disciplinary official in a monastic college (tratsang).">gegö</a>, it is the lene of the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. གྲྭ་ཚང] A &quot;college&quot; within a monastery, for example, in Drepung Monastery there were four main tratsang: Gomang, Loseling, Deyang and Ngagpa.

Tsogchen <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཞལ་ངོ] 1. A junior officer in the traditional Tibetan Army in charge of a unit (platoon) of 25 soldiers (same as dingpön). 2. The two head disciplinary officials for all of Drepung Monastery and for the Mönlam Prayer Festival.">Shengo</a> was also called Tsogchen Gegö. In the past, people use the short form of Drepung, Dre in front of the name of the tratsang like Dre <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. སྒོ་མང] One of the large colleges in Drepung Monastery.">Gomang</a> Tratsang etc.   

**Q:**  Can you say that Phodrang Deba is a title of the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཚོགས་ཆེན] The main assembly hall of a monastery. The assembly hall for the monastery as a whole.">tsogchen</a>?   

**A:**  No, you can't. Only in Drepung they have the palace, <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཕོ་བྲང] Abbreviation of Ganden Phodrang, the residence of the Dalai Lama in Drepung, and later, the residence of the Tibetan government&#x27;s representative in Drepung (the Phodrang depa).">phodrang</a>, [Tib. ཕོ་བྲང] of the Dalai Lama and it was said that the name Ganden Phodrang was originated from Drepung. So, the person who took care of that house was called Phodrang Depa and it belonged to our tratsang. This rotates among the 16 <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཁང་ཚན] A monastic residential unit in which monks from specific geographic areas lived. These were corporate entities with property and internal officials. Some large khamtsen had smaller subordinate units called mi tshan. Khamtsen were part of tratsang (colleges).

**A:**  Yes. When I was there, Shungpa Khamtsen got the turn and they did well.   

**Q:**  It seems to me that the Phodrang Depa didn't have much work.   

**A:**  Phodrang Depa probably had a good income and they have a large area of fields near the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཕོ་བྲང] Abbreviation of Ganden Phodrang, the residence of the Dalai Lama in Drepung, and later, the residence of the Tibetan government&#x27;s representative in Drepung (the Phodrang depa).">phodrang</a> and the stable and they would plant them and they didn't need to pay a single grain to anybody.   

**Q:**  I heard that they also got the rents of the houses and with regard to these fields he also had control over the water for irrigation.   

**Q:**  Phodrang Depa also got the 40 alms share of the Dalai Lama's throne in the tsogchen.   

**A:**  Probably not.
