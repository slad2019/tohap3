**Q:**  What is the difference between the <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. གཉེར་ཚང] 1. Storehouse. 2. Steward, person in charge of a storehouse. 3. A monastic official in charge of storerooms.">nyertsang</span> and <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. ཕྱག་སྦུག] A manager (of estates and endowments) of a monastic college or monastic khamtsen.">chabu</span> of <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. སྒོ་མང] One of the large colleges in Drepung Monastery.">Gomang</span> Tratsang (College)? How many <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. གཞིས་ཀ] A manorial estate.">shiga</span> (estates) were there under the nyertsang? Was it 6 or 4?   

**A:**  There were 6: Gyeba, [Tib. རྒྱས་པ] Shiga, Shangdön, [Tib. ?], Nambar [Tib.རྣམ་པར] Shiga, Nyemo Barthang Kharnga [Tib. སྙེ་མོ་བར་ཐང་མཁར་རྔ] Shiga, Nyemo Jangra, [Tib. ljangra] Shiga, Dzem Sanggar [Tib. 'dzems ?] Shiga. From these, Gyeba Shiga and Shangdön Shiga and the branch <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. གཞིས་ཀ] A manorial estate.">shiga</span> Gartog shiga were actually operated by the <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. གཉེར་ཚང] 1. Storehouse. 2. Steward, person in charge of a storehouse. 3. A monastic official in charge of storerooms.">nyertsang</span> and the rest were lent out on lease. The oil for the New Year Losar cookies came from Nyemo Barthang Kharnga Shiga. From Jangra we got some tsamba. As for Dzem Sanggar Shiga, we gave beans as a loan to the <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. མི་སེར] A term that can mean serf/bound subject as well as citizen, depending on context. For example, the miser of a lord would connote the bound subjects of that lord, whereas the miser of Tibet would connote citizens of Tibet.">miser</span> without interest starting from fist day of the 11th month and then in the spring we collected back wheat. This was called giving beans and collecting wheat, sentrödu, [Tib. སྲན་སྤྲོད་འབྲུ]. This shiga had 8 and a half <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. ཁྲལ་རྐང] The name of the basic tax unit for arable land in traditional Tibetan society. Families with farm land would have one or more fields of different sizes, e.g., 1 tregang or 1/2 of a tregang. This was defined by a fixed number of khe of seed (tib. sönkhe) that would be sown on that field. For example, one tregang in some areas would consist of 10 sönkhe. There was substantial variation between and within regions and types of estates.">tregang</span> [Tib. ཁྲལ་རྐང]. We got 1,000 <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. ཁལ] A traditional volume measurement used for measuring grain in traditional Tibetan society. Sizes of this unit varied somewhat, but the official government khe (called mkhar ru or bstan dzin mkha ru) weighed about 28-31 pounds for barley. It was used to convey the size of fields. For example, a field said to be 10 khe in size meant that 10 khe of seed could be sown on that field.">khe</span> of wheat which was divided among the miser and they had to mill it and bring it to the monastery to be used for making flour for the fried cookie, kabse [Tib. ཁ་ཟས].   

**Q:**  Did they have to work on the fields as an <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. འུལ་ལག] A generic term for corvée labor that had to be performed for one&#x27;s manorial estate/lord without pay. One kind of ula required people to go and work and another kind required the provision of transportation animals.">ula</span> in addition to this?   

**A:**  Yes. This was a tax for the monastery. They still had to work on the fields for the Shiga.   

**Q:**  Did you get the lease from the <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. གཞིས་ཀ] A manorial estate.">shiga</span> in addition to this wheat?   

**A:**  Yes.   

**Q:**  Do you remember how many <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. ཁལ] A traditional volume measurement used for measuring grain in traditional Tibetan society. Sizes of this unit varied somewhat, but the official government khe (called mkhar ru or bstan dzin mkha ru) weighed about 28-31 pounds for barley. It was used to convey the size of fields. For example, a field said to be 10 khe in size meant that 10 khe of seed could be sown on that field.">khe</span> of land each <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. གཞིས་ཀ] A manorial estate.">shiga</span> had?   

**Q:**  No.   

**Q:**  Do you send the shidü to some <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. གཞིས་ཀ] A manorial estate.">shiga</span>?   

**A:**  Yes, we sent them to Gyeba and Shangdön.   

**Q:**  Did the <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. ཕྱག་སྦུག] A manager (of estates and endowments) of a monastic college or monastic khamtsen.">chabu</span> have the authority over this?   

**A:**  No. The <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. གཉེར་ཚང] 1. Storehouse. 2. Steward, person in charge of a storehouse. 3. A monastic official in charge of storerooms.">nyertsang</span> had the complete authority over this.   

**Q:**  The <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. གཉེར་ཚང] 1. Storehouse. 2. Steward, person in charge of a storehouse. 3. A monastic official in charge of storerooms.">nyertsang</span> was run by the private, right?   

**A:**  Yes. Doing <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. གཉེར་ཚང] 1. Storehouse. 2. Steward, person in charge of a storehouse. 3. A monastic official in charge of storerooms.">nyertsang</span> was hard but not bad if there was a good harvest. My <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. ཤག་ཚང] 1. The household or family of a monk that consisted of multiple monks. 2. The apartment of a monk household.">shagtsang</span> held the nyertsang and the harvest was not good and had a very hard time because we had to supply the <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. གྲྭ་ཇ] The prayer session sponsored by the tratsang (college) at which tea was served to its monks who attended.">traja</span> all the time. The benefit from doing nyertsang was that you got a right of <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. ཐོན] In monasteries, a title for monks who have finished their monastic job obligations (tib. ཐོན་ཟིན).">thön</span>, [Tib. ཐོན] after the nyertsang was done and you could become a <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. སྤྱི་བསོ] The head managers/stewards of monasteries as a whole, especially the large Gelugpa monasteries like Sera and Drepung.">jiso</span> candidate.   

**Q:**  Why was it different if you got a good crop or bad? What did you do with the grain?   

**A:**  We use the grain to buy butter for the <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. གྲྭ་ཇ] The prayer session sponsored by the tratsang (college) at which tea was served to its monks who attended.">traja</span>, so it made a critical difference. We also got little bit butter from our nomad <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. མི་སེར] A term that can mean serf/bound subject as well as citizen, depending on context. For example, the miser of a lord would connote the bound subjects of that lord, whereas the miser of Tibet would connote citizens of Tibet.">miser</span> in Yangbajen, [Tib. ཡངས་པ་ཅན] where there were about 40-50 households of nomads. Even now it is called <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. སྒོ་མང] One of the large colleges in Drepung Monastery.">Gomang</span> Herd, [Tib. རུ་བ]. Then we also had nomad miser in Nyendrong [Tib. སྙན་གྲོང] where there were about 12-13 households it is the area just west of Damshung, [Tib. འདམ་གཞུང] and east of Yangpajen. Then in Chang Reting Kyangru [Tib. རྐྱང་རུ] we had little over 40 miser households. From these we got butter. Every 3 years we recounted the animals and recalculated the butter tax. From these we obtained about 500 <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. ཁལ] A traditional volume measurement used for measuring grain in traditional Tibetan society. Sizes of this unit varied somewhat, but the official government khe (called mkhar ru or bstan dzin mkha ru) weighed about 28-31 pounds for barley. It was used to convey the size of fields. For example, a field said to be 10 khe in size meant that 10 khe of seed could be sown on that field.">khe</span> of butter. We had some expenses at the time of calculation of animals. We had to give 5-6 khe of grain in Yangpajen and 5-6 of grain in Nyendrong to the tribe, tsopa to make <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. 1. ཆང, 2. བྱང] 1. Tibetan locally brewed barley beer. 2. North; nomad areas north of Lhasa in Nagchuga Prefecture 3. ch. 厂 factory.">chang</span> for the <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. དཔོན་པོ, མངའ་བདག] 1. A manorial estate holder. 2. Chief of an area.">lord</span> of the tribe. There was a book that specified all these things; it was called [Tib. དེབ་སྦྱར]. At Kyangru we had to spend about 30-40 khe of <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. རྩམ་པ] The traditional Tibetan staple food that consists of grain that is roasted (popped), usually in heated sand, and then ground into a flour.">tsamba</span> on the nomads. For one week, each day each nomad miser got three ladle-full of tsamba and 3 teas per day. This was when we went to collect taxes. On the last day, we gave them <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. ཐུག་པ] 1. A porridge or gruel-like soup typically made with tsamba, and if available, meat and cheese. 2. Noodle dishes in broth.">thukpa</span> of roughly ground barley, yörey [Tib. ཡོས་རལ] and at night we give <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. བག་ཐུག] A soup that contains a mixture of tiny dough (flour) balls the size of a fingernail (and if available, cheese, meat, and radishes).">bagthug</span> with some meat. We also gave this to the beggars in this area. If they couldn't finish their thukpa they could take it home.   

**Q:**  Did the two <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. གཉེར་ཚང] 1. Storehouse. 2. Steward, person in charge of a storehouse. 3. A monastic official in charge of storerooms.">nyertsang</span> have to operate those two <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. གཞིས་ཀ] A manorial estate.">shiga</span> or could they lease it out?   

**A:**  It was our choice. We had complete authority over what to do. We got from it whatever the yield was. We appointed 2 monks to act as shidü from the east <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. གཉེར་ཚང] 1. Storehouse. 2. Steward, person in charge of a storehouse. 3. A monastic official in charge of storerooms.">nyertsang</span> and the west nyertsang. We paid them each 40 <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. ཁལ] A traditional volume measurement used for measuring grain in traditional Tibetan society. Sizes of this unit varied somewhat, but the official government khe (called mkhar ru or bstan dzin mkha ru) weighed about 28-31 pounds for barley. It was used to convey the size of fields. For example, a field said to be 10 khe in size meant that 10 khe of seed could be sown on that field.">khe</span> of barley per year as the salary. We also sent one monk when planting the field which was called söngyab, [Tib. སོན་རྒྱབ]. He and the 2 shidü had to settle how much seed should be planted. Then there was a person who checked the harvest called töngyab, [Tib. སྟོན་རྒྱབ] sent at harvest time. He stayed until the grain was harvested and stored in the granary.   

**Q:**  Where is Shangdön located?   

**A:**  It is located in Tölung Boma on this side of the river where there are lots of leopards.   

**Q:**  Being a shidü was not a monk's obligation called the tax of the lower garment, [Tib. ཤབ་ཐབ་ཀྱི་ཁྲལ], right?   

**A:**  Yes.   

**Q:**  Was it appointed or they have to request it?   

**A:**  The shidü were chosen by the <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. གཉེར་ཚང] 1. Storehouse. 2. Steward, person in charge of a storehouse. 3. A monastic official in charge of storerooms.">nyertsang</span> from among their friends and trustworthy people who they thought were capable.   

**Q:**  Usually, the <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. གཉེར་ཚང] 1. Storehouse. 2. Steward, person in charge of a storehouse. 3. A monastic official in charge of storerooms.">nyertsang</span> would buy butter with the grain they got from the <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. གཞིས་ཀ] A manorial estate.">shiga</span> and if it was not enough, they had to add it, right?   

**A:**  Yes. At the normal <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. གྲྭ་ཇ] The prayer session sponsored by the tratsang (college) at which tea was served to its monks who attended.">traja</span>, we gave 4 teas each session, and use 4 <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. ཁལ] A traditional volume measurement used for measuring grain in traditional Tibetan society. Sizes of this unit varied somewhat, but the official government khe (called mkhar ru or bstan dzin mkha ru) weighed about 28-31 pounds for barley. It was used to convey the size of fields. For example, a field said to be 10 khe in size meant that 10 khe of seed could be sown on that field.">khe</span> of butter per tea or 16 khe of butter per sessions. The scale <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. ཉ་ག] A weight measurement unit. About 10 nyaga was equal to one gyama, which weighed 1.1 lbs.).">nyaga</span> was a little smaller than the others. And we use 8 bagjung for one tea. The tea was crumbled on the night before the traja and the <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. ནང་མ] A minor monk assistant to the Shengo at the Mönlam Chemmo Prayer Festival. These nangma ranked below the Chagdampa.">nangma</span>, <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. དགེ་སྐོས] The main disciplinary official in a monastic college (tratsang).">gegö</span>'s servant and a representative of the <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. བླ་བྲང] 1.

When the butter was weighed, a wooden seal was stamped on it. Then they put the tea in the caldron and covered the pot.   

**Q:**  Who did the work like smashing the tea leaves?   

**A:**  The <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. གཉེར་ཚང] 1. Storehouse. 2. Steward, person in charge of a storehouse. 3. A monastic official in charge of storerooms.">nyertsang</span>'s 2 inner <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. གཉེར་པ] A steward or manager. In some monasteries, the nyerpa was in charge of storerooms under the authority of a higher manager called a chandzö.">nyerpa</span>, nangnyer, [Tib. ནང་གཉེར] would check and weigh the butter. The checked tea was smashed on the square stone placed on the top of the <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. སྒོ་མང] One of the large colleges in Drepung Monastery.">Gomang</span> Tratsang and then the <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. ནང་མ] A minor monk assistant to the Shengo at the Mönlam Chemmo Prayer Festival. These nangma ranked below the Chagdampa.">nangma</span> would put the tea in the cauldron, cover it and put a earthen seal on it and then the butter was sealed and carried back to the nyertsang for the night. The next day the nyertsang sent <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. ཐབ་གཡོག] Monks or laymen who work as servants/manual laborers in kitchens (normally monastic kitchens).">thabyog</span> to take the butter out of storeroom. At that time, the nyertsang sent one monk called martunga [Tib. མར་སྲུང་བ] to ensure that thabyog didn't steal butter when it was time to put it in.   

**Q:**  Would they send one of their <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. དགེ་ཕྲུག] 1. Student. 2. Disciple. 3. Commonly the name for monks living with a gegen or teacher. These are more like wards than real disciples.">gidru</span> to do this?   

**A:**  Yes.   

**Q:**  Who would make the fire?

And did you have a name for it?   

**A:**  Oh yes. We had totally separate storerooms. On the top of the stone stair, there is a long storeroom and on the other side, there was a storeroom called Namsekhang [Tib. རྣམ་སྲས་ཁང] where we store the butter and this is called Jishung [Tib. སྤྱི་གཞུང] Nyertsang. In these, we mainly stored butter and below that there was the storeroom of the west nyetysang. We would take some from these storerooms and then move it to the kitchen, <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. རུང་ཁང] A monastic kitchen.">rungkhang</span> which is also called Jishung Rungkhang.   

**Q:**  Did the <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. གཉེར་ཚང] 1. Storehouse. 2. Steward, person in charge of a storehouse. 3. A monastic official in charge of storerooms.">nyertsang</span> have a cashier?   

**A:**  No. In addition to the <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. གྲྭ་ཇ] The prayer session sponsored by the tratsang (college) at which tea was served to its monks who attended.">traja</span>, we also had to serve butter tea to the <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. ཕྱག་སྦུག] A manager (of estates and endowments) of a monastic college or monastic khamtsen.">chabu</span> everyday. There was also a <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. མགོན་ཁང] A chapel devoted to a protector deity.">gönkhang</span>. In the gönkhang there were 9 monks doing the ritual for propitiating,[Tib. བསྐངས་བསོ] the protective deity Maha Kala, Gompo,[Tib. མགོན་པོ] every day. 4 of these were from <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. བླ་བྲང] 1. The property/wealth owning corporate entity of an incarnate lama. 2. The property/wealth owning corporate entity of the Panchen Lama.">labrang</span> and 4 from nyertsnag and 1 from Kündeling, [Tib. ཀུན་བདེ་གླིང] Labrang whose salary was also paid by the Kündeling. Everyday, we had to give our 4 monks a large iron ladle full [Tib. ལྕགས་གསར] of <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. རྩམ་པ] The traditional Tibetan staple food that consists of grain that is roasted (popped), usually in heated sand, and then ground into a flour.">tsamba</span> and the monks would put the <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. རྩམ་པ] The traditional Tibetan staple food that consists of grain that is roasted (popped), usually in sand, and then ground into a flour.">tsampa</span> in their wooden container called, pagphor, [Tib. སྤགས་ཕོར]. And we also gave a lesser amount of tsampa to all the nine monks and serve tea to all of them. Sometimes the labrang served the tea, but mostly we did.   

**Q:**  How were the storerooms opened and locked?   

**A:**  Each nangnyer had his own lock and both of them were needed to open the store.   

**Q:**  What was the term of <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. ཕྱག་སྦུག] A manager (of estates and endowments) of a monastic college or monastic khamtsen.">chabu</span> and <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. གཉེར་ཚང] 1. Storehouse. 2. Steward, person in charge of a storehouse. 3. A monastic official in charge of storerooms.">nyertsang</span>?   

**A:**  Nyertsang was 3 years, the <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. ཕྱག་སྦུག] A manager (of estates and endowments) of a monastic college or monastic khamtsen.">chabu</span> had no fixed term and it depended on the ability of the chabu. Samlo, Hamdong and Gungru had many <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. ཚོགས་འདུ] 1. The general name for the various types of Tibetan government assemblies. 2. Any assembly, e.g., the assembly (meeting) of monks in a college.">tsondu</span> members, but Badi had only about 10 monks in 1959 and there were not tsondu members. So whether their chabu was capable or not, we had to leave him there. So for the Badi, their chabu would stay there for years since they had no one else to substitute.   

**Q:**  Who selected the <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. གཉེར་ཚང] 1. Storehouse. 2. Steward, person in charge of a storehouse. 3. A monastic official in charge of storerooms.">nyertsang</span>?   

**A:**  The <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. བླ་བྲང] 1. The property/wealth owning corporate entity of an incarnate lama. 2. The property/wealth owning corporate entity of the Panchen Lama.">labrang</span> abbot put forward the candidate of the <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. གཉེར་ཚང] 1. Storehouse. 2. Steward, person in charge of a storehouse. 3. A monastic official in charge of storerooms.">nyertsang</span> internally, but probably, it was appointed by the government. I don't remember clearly.   

**Q:**  We heard that it was just namely appointed by the government, but they would appoint the candidate that was submitted. Was the candidate put forward by the abbot?   

**A:**  Yes.   

**Q:**  Was there the custom of bribing the abbot?   

**A:**  Yes there was. The abbot also appoints the umdze and <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. དགེ་སྐོས] The main disciplinary official in a monastic college (tratsang).">gegö</span>, but the abbot had to ask the monk to be gegö, since no one wanted to do it.   

**Q:**  The <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. དགེ་སྐོས] The main disciplinary official in a monastic college (tratsang).">gegö</span> had the power. Why didn't the monks want to do this?   

**A:**  The <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. དགེ་སྐོས] The main disciplinary official in a monastic college (tratsang).">gegö</span> gets 11 additional alms share and the term is for 6 months and at the end he would have to pay each monk like 1-2 <span class="tooltip" data-text="[ch. 毛] A Chinese currency unit. 10 maotse = 1 yuan. 10 fen = one maotse.">maotse</span> which was called, the substitute of <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. ཐུག་པ] 1. A porridge or gruel-like soup typically made with tsamba, and if available, meat and cheese. 2. Noodle dishes in broth.">thukpa</span>, [Tib. ཐུག་དོད] and in the past it was like 1-3 <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. ཞོ] A unit in the traditional Tibetan currency system. 10 sho equaled to 1 sang and 10 karma equaled one sho.">sho</span> and also have to serve tea to the monks. According to our custom, during the summer retreat, [Tib. དབྱར་ཆོས] the gegö should be a <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. བླ་རྒྱུད་པ] A term for the common monks in a monastery (in contrast to the scholar monks who were actively studying the Buddhist doctrine).">lagyüba</span> and in winter it was <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. དཔེ་ཆ་བ] A monk studying the monastic philosophical curriculum. A scholar monk.">pechawa</span>. When I was small there was no difference of summer and winter. It didn't matter whether the gegö was bechawa and lagyüpa. But in winter, there was a class called thug <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. ཆོས་ར] The special grove (&quot;dharma grove&quot;) in monasteries where monks formally met to practice debating.">chöra</span>, [Tib. ཐུགས་ཆོས་ར] where the lagyüba gegö didn't understand how to do that because it was very complicated one and the gegö went back to the <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. 1. ཤག, 2. ཞག] 1. The apartment/room of a monk. 2. The butter fat that coagulates on the top of butter-tea when the tea is left to sit for some time. If the tea had been made with a lot of butter, this layer could be thick enough to scoop off and save to later sell or eat separately. The senior monks are usually served tea with a lot of shag.">shag</span> after the <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. གྲྭ་ཇ] The prayer session sponsored by the tratsang (college) at which tea was served to its monks who attended.">traja</span> was over and the umdze had to do this. Therefore, they found that they needed a pechawa and since then, they changed the rule.   

**Q:**  Did the <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. གཉེར་ཚང] 1. Storehouse. 2. Steward, person in charge of a storehouse. 3. A monastic official in charge of storerooms.">nyertsang</span> bribe the abbot?   

**A:**  Yes, but there was no fixed amount and 1-2 <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. རྡོ་ཚད] A currency unit in traditional Tibet that was equal to 50 ngüsang.">dotse</span> was okay as there wasn't so much rushing [Tib. འཚང་ཁ] for the position. There was also not much rushing for the umdze position. When I became umdze, there were at first 25 monks who wanted it. First they held a competition of voice. Then after comparing the voice etc., these were reduced to 5 candidates and then they did the <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. ཟན་རིལ] A divine lottery. Multiple answers to a question were written on paper of the same size and rolled in dough balls of the same size and weight. These were shaken in a plate or bowl in front of a statue of a deity until one of the balls popped out. The ball that popped out was considered to have been selected by the deity before which the lottery was done.">senriy</span> in front of the Deity Gompo and my name came out. There was no custom of selecting <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. གཉེར་ཚང] 1. Storehouse. 2. Steward, person in charge of a storehouse. 3.

Did they have to give alms?   

**A:**  They have something to do like paying little bit money salary. There is an endowment [Tib. ཐེབ་རྩ] for this that they give loans and use the interest for the salary.   

**Q:**  Then they needed to have a cashier, right?   

**A:**  No, they didn't need it.   

**Q:**  Who kept the money?   

**A:**  They divided the money among the two nyertsang. They then lend this and the capital is used for the money salary.   

**Q:**  How much of an endowment did they have? Was it like 100-200 <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. རྡོ་ཚད] A currency unit in traditional Tibet that was equal to 50 ngüsang.">dotse</span>?   

**A:**  I don't remember how much the endowment, <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. ཐེབས་རྩ] An endowment fund.">thebtsa</span>, [Tib. ཐེབ་རྩ] was but from 50 <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. རྡོ་ཚད] A currency unit in traditional Tibet that was equal to 50 ngüsang.">dotse</span> in the thebtsa, the monks get 1 <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. ཏམ་ཀ] A unit in the traditional Tibetan currency system that was equal to 4 sang.">tranka</span> each.   

**Q:**  Were there about 4,000 monks?   

**A:**  There was more than 5,000 monks. The amount of the endowment was like early time and it was not allowed to increase it. Probably, the endowment was 2,500 <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. སྲང] A unit of traditional Tibetan currency. It was also called ngüsang [tib. དངུལ་སྲང]. 50 nügsang = 1 dotse; 10 sho = 1 nügsang; 20 5-karma coins = 1 ngüsang. There were also paper currency notes of 7-sang, 25-sang, and 10-sang denominations.">sang</span> = 50 dotse.   

**Q:**  Was there a limit for the interest when they give loans?   

**A:**  We lent it out at 20% interest, [Tib. བཅུ་སྐྱེད] although the <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. གྲྭ་ཚང] A &quot;college&quot; within a monastery, for example, in Drepung Monastery there were four main tratsang: Gomang, Loseling, Deyang and Ngagpa. These tratsang were property owning corporate entities and included monks who were organized into residential dormitories called Khamtsen.">tratsang</span>'s endowment rate was 16% [Tib. བརྒྱད་སྐྱེད] interest.   

**Q:**  How did they use this money profit they get from the difference between the interest?

A monastic official in charge of storerooms.">nyertsang</span> got this profit and in the future and it was okay if you could hand over the capital. When we finished doing the nyertsang, we couldn't hand over the capital.   

**Q:**  At that time, didn't the debtors pay you the capital back?   

**Q:**  They paid the loan, but the expenses of the <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. གཉེར་ཚང] 1. Storehouse. 2. Steward, person in charge of a storehouse. 3. A monastic official in charge of storerooms.">nyertsang</span> was too much, so we had to borrow money from others to hand over the capital.

I heard that when we became the nyertsang, it caused a great harm to Takhare, when we did the nyertsang because the Takare had to spend a lot for bribing. That's why they held the grudge though we didn't ask for the jiso because we were not capable of doing that.   

**Q:**  Was there anything to do with the crops?   

**Q:**  Yes the yield was also not that good.   

**Q:**  Was there any other expenditures?   

**A:**  We had to buy 500 <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. ཁལ] A traditional volume measurement used for measuring grain in traditional Tibetan society. Sizes of this unit varied somewhat, but the official government khe (called mkhar ru or bstan dzin mkha ru) weighed about 28-31 pounds for barley. It was used to convey the size of fields.

**Q:**  No we didn't. We collected the butter from the nomads. We also had some income from the forced selling, bamtsong pügyur, [Tib. འབམ་ཚོང་སྤུས་སྒྱུར]. We gave them 60 <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. ཁ་བཏགས] A Tibetan ceremonial scarf given to lamas, visitors, etc.">khata</span> and they gave us 2 <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. བྲེ] A unit of traditional volume measurement [a container] in Tibet, 20 of which typically equaled one khe or bo [also a container], although in some areas there were only 16 dre in one khe.">dre</span> of dried cheese for each khata.

[Tib. ཕུག་མའི་འོག་གི་ཆུ་དོང] When we sent the butter load to the nyertsang we would have to weigh it again in Lhasa. I did the job very honestly. When I received the butter from the nomads, if the leather for wrapping the butter is dry, I weigh it as it is and if the leather is wet, I would always reduce the weight of the wet leather. So from the next year they would not use the wet leather,

The children of human lease peasants inherited this status from parents of the same sex (i.e. sons of a male belonged to their father&#x27;s lord).">mibo</span>?   

**A:**  Yes they did.

**Q:**  What happened when families split and two sons take their bride, were they allowed to divide the <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. ཁྲལ་རྐང] The name of the basic tax unit for arable land in traditional Tibetan society. Families with farm land would have one or more fields of different sizes, e.g., 1 tregang or 1/2 of a tregang.

There was substantial variation between and within regions and types of estates.">tregang</span>?   

**A:**  These are decided by the shidü. We did have one case in Yangbachen. A big family mother and father were getting into fight and the kids split into two groups also. Whatever divided advice we gave them they wouldn't listen and said they want to divide. So in the end, all the animals and things were divided.

The children of human lease peasants inherited this status from parents of the same sex (i.e. sons of a male belonged to their father&#x27;s lord).">mibo</span>, would he be allowed to do that?   

**A:**  Most probably not allowed among the farmers except the chödrö.   

**Q:**  Did he have to ask for the permission to get married?   

**A:**  The shiü would make all the decision and he would say that he had all the authority of the <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. གཞིས་ཀ] A manorial estate.">shiga</span> since he paid the lease.   

**Q:**  What did the <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. ཕྱག་སྦུག] A manager (of estates and endowments) of a monastic college or monastic khamtsen.">chabu</span> do?

**A:**  Yes. And the <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. ཕྱག་སྦུག] A manager (of estates and endowments) of a monastic college or monastic khamtsen.">chabu</span> also had the grain capital for paying the salary. Once when they did the accounting, they found that the chabu had about 200,000-300 000 <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. ཁལ] A traditional volume measurement used for measuring grain in traditional Tibetan society.

They had to submit the account to the government once every three years. But not too long before the revolt the common monks petitioned to have another accounting to see how much was really there and they said that they wanted the chabu to give more grain salary]. The monks said if there is a lot of grain we should get more grain salary. This went to the Branch Judicial System for settling the disputes, [Tib. གྱོད་ཞིབ] and they sent officials and did a detailed accounting, but they just did it according to the total number of grain we put under the account. Otherwise, they couldn't do the accounting one by one.

**A:**  It was independent. They had three units which were completely separate from <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. གཉེར་ཚང] 1. Storehouse. 2. Steward, person in charge of a storehouse. 3. A monastic official in charge of storerooms.">nyertsang</span> and chabu. There was a two joint nyidrel, [Tib. ཉིས་སྦྲེལ] and three joint, sumdrel, [Tib. སུམ་སྦྲེལ] and four joint, shidrel, [Tib. བཞི་སྦྲེལ]. They had their own tongdeb listing their duties. The <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. དངུལ་གཉེར] Accountant, bookkeeper, cashier.

**Q:**  Who would appoint the <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. དངུལ་གཉེར] Accountant, bookkeeper, cashier. Someone in charge of cash.">ngünyer</span>? The <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. ཕྱག་སྦུག] A manager (of estates and endowments) of a monastic college or monastic khamtsen.">chabu</span> or the <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. ཚོགས་འདུ] 1.

**A:**  They were appointed by the <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. ཕྱག་སྦུག] A manager (of estates and endowments) of a monastic college or monastic khamtsen.">chabu</span> alone. But at one it was hard to find people doing <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. དངུལ་གཉེར] Accountant, bookkeeper, cashier. Someone in charge of cash.">ngünyer</span>, so the chabu started a new custom of the ngünyer getting <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. ཐོན] In monasteries, a title for monks who have finished their monastic job obligations (tib. ཐོན་ཟིན).">thön</span> and being able to wear resom, [Tib. རས་ཟོམ] boots.

**Q:**  People say that the <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. ཕྱག་སྦུག] A manager (of estates and endowments) of a monastic college or monastic khamtsen.">chabu</span> was powerful, but actually what kind of the power did it have? For example, the <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. གཉེར་ཚང] 1. Storehouse. 2. Steward, person in charge of a storehouse. 3. A monastic official in charge of storerooms.">nyertsang</span> did their own job, right?   

**A:**  The <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. ཕྱག་སྦུག] A manager (of estates and endowments) of a monastic college or monastic khamtsen.">chabu</span>'s power was to embezzle the wealth of the tratsang. When the chabu meets, they definitely ate one meal and sometimes two and the tea was served all the time. Regularly, there were the <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. བླ་བྲང] 1.

**Q:**  When the <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. ཕྱག་སྦུག] A manager (of estates and endowments) of a monastic college or monastic khamtsen.">chabu</span> meet, what do they discuss and decide?   

**A:**  They dealt with all the matters about their <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. མི་སེར] A term that can mean serf/bound subject as well as citizen, depending on context. For example, the miser of a lord would connote the bound subjects of that lord, whereas the miser of Tibet would connote citizens of Tibet.">miser</span>, like giving the chödrö. And <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. ཕྱག་སྦུག] A manager (of estates and endowments) of a monastic college or monastic khamtsen.">chabu</span> did all the administrative works like renovating the tratsang.   

**Q:**  But they did not deal with the <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. མི་སེར] A term that can mean serf/bound subject as well as citizen, depending on context. For example, the miser of a lord would connote the bound subjects of that lord, whereas the miser of Tibet would connote citizens of Tibet.">miser</span> under the <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. གཉེར་ཚང] 1.

**A:**  Yes.   

**Q:**  What other power did they have?   

**A:**  They did all the work in the <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. གྲྭ་ཚང] A &quot;college&quot; within a monastery, for example, in Drepung Monastery there were four main tratsang: Gomang, Loseling, Deyang and Ngagpa. These tratsang were property owning corporate entities and included monks who were organized into residential dormitories called Khamtsen.">tratsang</span> like buying things and making the religious decorations for the tratsang.   

**Q:**  Did the <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. ཕྱག་སྦུག] A manager (of estates and endowments) of a monastic college or monastic khamtsen.">chabu</span> have nomads?

**Q:**  Did the <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. ཕྱག་སྦུག] A manager (of estates and endowments) of a monastic college or monastic khamtsen.">chabu</span> take care of renovating the <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. གྲྭ་ཚང] A &quot;college&quot; within a monastery, for example, in Drepung Monastery there were four main tratsang: Gomang, Loseling, Deyang and Ngagpa. These tratsang were property owning corporate entities and included monks who were organized into residential dormitories called Khamtsen.">tratsang</span>?   

**A:**  Yes.   

**Q:**  So the money of the <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. དངུལ་གཉེར] Accountant, bookkeeper, cashier. Someone in charge of cash.">ngünyer</span> was used for paying the salary, right?   

**A:**  Yes. Because the <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. དངུལ་གཉེར] Accountant, bookkeeper, cashier. Someone in charge of cash.">ngünyer</span> got the <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. ཐོན] In monasteries, a title for monks who have finished their monastic job obligations (tib. ཐོན་ཟིན).">thön</span> when they terminated, they gave the <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. གྲྭ་ཚང] A &quot;college&quot; within a monastery, for example, in Drepung Monastery there were four main tratsang: Gomang, Loseling, Deyang and Ngagpa. These tratsang were property owning corporate entities and included monks who were organized into residential dormitories called Khamtsen.">tratsang</span> gifts. For example the chibgyur ngünyer made many religious decorations like covering the pillars. They would also ask for some different kind of donations like the donation for the summer propitiating the deities, yarsöl, [Tib. གཡར་གསོལ] etc. In fact, the ngünyer sumdre usually didn't just lend out money they engage in trade so that they could get some extra profit to leave for the monastery.   

**Q:**  Did you ever use the extra money for adding it on the capital?   

**A:**  No. The <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. དངུལ་གཉེར] Accountant, bookkeeper, cashier. Someone in charge of cash.">ngünyer</span> would save the extra money and give loans and when you get the interest; they added it on the capital.   

**Q:**  Did they ever think of adding the extra on the endowments?   

**A:**  No. At one time there were many monks doing <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. གྲྭ་ཚང] A &quot;college&quot; within a monastery, for example, in Drepung Monastery there were four main tratsang: Gomang, Loseling, Deyang and Ngagpa.

There were tratsang chöndze and khamtsen chöndze.">chöndze</span>. The reason was that in <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. སྒོ་མང] One of the large colleges in Drepung Monastery.">Gomang</span> they had to serve only one <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. གྲྭ་ཇ] The prayer session sponsored by the tratsang (college) at which tea was served to its monks who attended.">traja</span> and they use only 2-3 <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. ཁལ] A traditional volume measurement used for measuring grain in traditional Tibetan society. Sizes of this unit varied somewhat, but the official government khe (called mkhar ru or bstan dzin mkha ru) weighed about 28-31 pounds for barley. It was used to convey the size of fields. For example, a field said to be 10 khe in size meant that 10 khe of seed could be sown on that field.">khe</span> of butter. They had to offer 1,000 butter lamps in front of Tsongkhapa. But later some chöndze stopped offering the butter lamp. So later the <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. ཕྱག་སྦུག] A manager (of estates and endowments) of a monastic college or monastic khamtsen.">chabu</span> made a new rule. It said that they have to offer 1,000 butter lamps or leave an endowment, bungjog, [Tib. སྦུག་འཇོག] of 50 <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. རྡོ་ཚད] A currency unit in traditional Tibet that was equal to 50 ngüsang.">dotse</span> to the tratsang for giving one <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. ཏམ་ཀ] A unit in the traditional Tibetan currency system that was equal to 4 sang.">tranka</span> alms for each monk. In the past, the bungjog was 7 dotse. And they also have to use 8 khe of butter on the traja. But even after this there were many chöndze giving the tonggo. In the past, the uchö and the tratsang jama had to go to <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. 1. ཤག, 2. ཞག] 1. The apartment/room of a monk. 2. The butter fat that coagulates on the top of butter-tea when the tea is left to sit for some time. If the tea had been made with a lot of butter, this layer could be thick enough to scoop off and save to later sell or eat separately. The senior monks are usually served tea with a lot of shag.">shag</span> of the chöndze and weigh the butter and tea. But later they didn't do that.   

**Q:**  If some sponsors like a <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. ཚོགས་ཆེན] The main assembly hall of a monastery. The assembly hall for the monastery as a whole.">tsogchen</span> trüku wanted to leave an endowment who would make the division? Was it the nyertysang or the <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. ཕྱག་སྦུག] A manager (of estates and endowments) of a monastic college or monastic khamtsen.">chabu</span>?   

**A:**  It was up to the sponsor and some leave a lot for the <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. གྲྭ་ཚང] A &quot;college&quot; within a monastery, for example, in Drepung Monastery there were four main tratsang: Gomang, Loseling, Deyang and Ngagpa. These tratsang were property owning corporate entities and included monks who were organized into residential dormitories called Khamtsen.">tratsang</span>. They would give the alms on that day and they would write in the list of requesting prayers, kyabtho [Tib. སྐྱབ་ཐོ] that they would leave the endowment to the tratsang or <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. དངུལ་གཉེར] Accountant, bookkeeper, cashier. Someone in charge of cash.">ngünyer</span> etc whatever they liked.   

**Q:**  Who selected the <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. སྤྱི་བསོ] The head managers/stewards of monasteries as a whole, especially the large Gelugpa monasteries like Sera and Drepung.">jiso</span> candidates?   

**A:**  Probably, the <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. བླ་བྲང] 1. The property/wealth owning corporate entity of an incarnate lama. 2. The property/wealth owning corporate entity of the Panchen Lama.">labrang</span> selected. I am not sure.   

**Q:**  The <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. སྤྱི་བསོ] The head managers/stewards of monasteries as a whole, especially the large Gelugpa monasteries like Sera and Drepung.">jiso</span> term was 10 years, right?   

**A:**  Yes.   

**Q:**  So there would be the three candidates for each <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. སྤྱི་བསོ] The head managers/stewards of monasteries as a whole, especially the large Gelugpa monasteries like Sera and Drepung.">jiso</span>, right?   

**A:**  Yes.   

**Q:**  Did the candidates go according to the seniority or did they just select them?   

**A:**  They selected them. If some one was the incumbent <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. གཉེར་ཚང] 1. Storehouse. 2. Steward, person in charge of a storehouse. 3. A monastic official in charge of storerooms.">nyertsang</span>, he would become the first candidate of the jiso.   

**Q:**  Who would select the candidates? Was it the <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. བླ་བྲང] 1. The property/wealth owning corporate entity of an incarnate lama. 2. The property/wealth owning corporate entity of the Panchen Lama.">labrang</span> or the <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. ཕྱག་སྦུག] A manager (of estates and endowments) of a monastic college or monastic khamtsen.">chabu</span>?   

**A:**  Maybe the <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. བླ་བྲང] 1. The property/wealth owning corporate entity of an incarnate lama. 2. The property/wealth owning corporate entity of the Panchen Lama.">labrang</span> and <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. ཕྱག་སྦུག] A manager (of estates and endowments) of a monastic college or monastic khamtsen.">chabu</span> did it jointly. I was among the candidates twice, but I don't remember clearly. Later, the <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. སྤྱི་བསོ] The head managers/stewards of monasteries as a whole, especially the large Gelugpa monasteries like Sera and Drepung.">jiso</span> was run by the monastery itself, [Tib. གཞུང་འཛིན] and they could do it just for 2 years. Trindor: But each jiso kept three <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. གཞིས་ཀ] A manorial estate.">shiga</span> for themselves. [laughter]   

**Q:**  I heard from somebody that the monastery as a whole was called <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. ཚོགས་ཆེན] The main assembly hall of a monastery. The assembly hall for the monastery as a whole.">tsogchen</span>, is this correct?   

**A:**  Yes. The <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. ཚོགས་ཆེན] The main assembly hall of a monastery. The assembly hall for the monastery as a whole.">tshogchen</span> was the place where all the monks of the monastery assemble and the <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. མང་ཇ] The morning tea served to monks from all the monastic colleges at the main prayer assembly hall.">mangja</span> was also served by the government. So it was something like the whole monastery was also called tsogchen. But if you say Drepung, then the whole monastery is included.   

**Q:**  For example, if I say that there are many monastic officials, <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. ལས་སྣེ] The general name for all monastic officials.">lene</span>, [Tib. ལས་སྣེ] in the <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. ཚོགས་ཆེན] The main assembly hall of a monastery.

**A:**  If you say this, the <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. ལས་སྣེ] The general name for all monastic officials.">lene</span> of the <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. གྲྭ་ཚང] A &quot;college&quot; within a monastery, for example, in Drepung Monastery there were four main tratsang: Gomang, Loseling, Deyang and Ngagpa. These tratsang were property owning corporate entities and included monks who were organized into residential dormitories called Khamtsen.">tratsang</span> was not included in this. Actually, <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. ཚོགས་ཆེན] The main assembly hall of a monastery. The assembly hall for the monastery as a whole.">tsogchen</span> means the big assembly hall and doesn't have other meanings.   

**Q:**  Would the laji and the <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. སྤྱི་བསོ] The head managers/stewards of monasteries as a whole, especially the large Gelugpa monasteries like Sera and Drepung.">jiso</span> include in the <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. ཚོགས་ཆེན] The main assembly hall of a monastery. The assembly hall for the monastery as a whole.">tsogchen</span>?   

**A:**  Yes. <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. སྤྱི་བསོ] The head managers/stewards of monasteries as a whole, especially the large Gelugpa monasteries like Sera and Drepung.">jiso</span> belonged to laji. The main in charge of the laji are the abbots.   

**Q:**  If you said the <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. ལས་སྣེ] The general name for all monastic officials.">lene</span> of the Drepung, this includes all the lene and how about if you say <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. ཚོགས་ཆེན] The main assembly hall of a monastery. The assembly hall for the monastery as a whole.">tsogchen</span> lene?   

**A:**  If you say <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. ཚོགས་ཆེན] The main assembly hall of a monastery. The assembly hall for the monastery as a whole.">tsogchen</span> <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. ལས་སྣེ] The general name for all monastic officials.">lene</span>, now people might understand it is the shengo. If you say <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. དགེ་སྐོས] The main disciplinary official in a monastic college (tratsang).">gegö</span>, it is the lene of the <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. གྲྭ་ཚང] A &quot;college&quot; within a monastery, for example, in Drepung Monastery there were four main tratsang: Gomang, Loseling, Deyang and Ngagpa.

**A:**  No, you can't. Only in Drepung they have the palace, <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. ཕོ་བྲང] Abbreviation of Ganden Phodrang, the residence of the Dalai Lama in Drepung, and later, the residence of the Tibetan government&#x27;s representative in Drepung (the Phodrang depa).">phodrang</span>, [Tib. ཕོ་བྲང] of the Dalai Lama and it was said that the name Ganden Phodrang was originated from Drepung.
