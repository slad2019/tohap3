## Abstract  

 Thubden Legchog [Tib. ཐུབ་བསྟན་ལེགས་མཆོག] first became a monk in Dechen Chönkhor [Tib. བདེ་ཆེན་ཆོས་འཁོར],a Kagyupa [Tib. བཀའ་རྒྱུད་པ] monastery. Then at age 15 [1927], he ran away from Lhoka and came to Drepung and enrolled at Deyang Tratsang because he had a maternal uncle in Deyang. In this interview he discussed issues surrounding the Enchöndze, a monastic leader that can be drawn from ranks of abbot, chöndze, or shungshab. Discussed are issues of how a tsidrung receives the rank of enchöndze. There are also details of two governing bodies within the monasteries, the tsondu with 14 members and the 16 khamtsen. Details are provided on how the tsondu with 14 members operates and the composition of its membership. In conclusion are details of the accounting of grain and how, at times, this caused political problems with among monks.

In Hamdong, Washu Mitsen is really three mitsen merged together. in the early times, they might be separate and doing well, but later they became poor and merged together.

They were separate, but there were the monks from Samlo and Hamdong in these.   

**Q:**  Among the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཁང་ཚན] A monastic residential unit in which monks from specific geographic areas lived. These were corporate entities with property and internal officials. Some large khamtsen had smaller subordinate units called mi tshan. Khamtsen were part of tratsang (colleges). For example, Hamdong Khamtsen was part of Gomang College in Drepung Monastery.">khamtsen</a>, I have Samlo, Khalkha [Tib. ཁལ་ཁ] and Gönlung [Tib. དགོན་ལུང].

**A:**  It was one tsondu. At first they had 14 members and they didn't have a clerk then. Later, the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. གྲྭ་ཚང] A &quot;college&quot; within a monastery, for example, in Drepung Monastery there were four main tratsang: Gomang, Loseling, Deyang and Ngagpa. These tratsang were property owning corporate entities and included monks who were organized into residential dormitories called Khamtsen.">tratsang</a> had to do lot of accounting and they had to deliver the accounts of 3 years to the Yigtsang. So they needed a clerk and added one clerk, then after a while they added a second clerk and then it became 16 members.   

**Q:**  What is the difference between the 14 <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཚོགས་འདུ] 1. The general name for the various types of Tibetan government assemblies. 2. Any assembly, e.g., the assembly (meeting) of monks in a college.">tsondu</a> members and the 16 <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཁང་ཚན] A monastic residential unit in which monks from specific geographic areas lived.

**A:**  The <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཚོགས་འདུ] 1. The general name for the various types of Tibetan government assemblies. 2. Any assembly, e.g., the assembly (meeting) of monks in a college.">tsondu</a> is little higher. If the 5 <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཕྱག་སྦུག] A manager (of estates and endowments) of a monastic college or monastic khamtsen.">chabu</a> who do most of the work can't settle an issue, they would convene the 14 tsondu member. If they can't settle it, then they convene the 16 <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཁང་ཚན] A monastic residential unit in which monks from specific geographic areas lived. These were corporate entities with property and internal officials. Some large khamtsen had smaller subordinate units called mi tshan. Khamtsen were part of tratsang (colleges).

These were corporate entities with property and internal officials. Some large khamtsen had smaller subordinate units called mi tshan. Khamtsen were part of tratsang (colleges). For example, Hamdong Khamtsen was part of Gomang College in Drepung Monastery.">khamtsen</a>?   

**A:**  One <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཚོགས་འདུ] 1. The general name for the various types of Tibetan government assemblies. 2. Any assembly, e.g., the assembly (meeting) of monks in a college.">tsondu</a> member or a <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཁང་ཚན་དགེ་རྒན] The head official of a khamtsen.">khamtsen gegen</a> from all the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཁང་ཚན] A monastic residential unit in which monks from specific geographic areas lived. These were corporate entities with property and internal officials. Some large khamtsen had smaller subordinate units called mi tshan. Khamtsen were part of tratsang (colleges). For example, Hamdong Khamtsen was part of Gomang College in Drepung Monastery.">khamtsen</a> would come. In the past, there were no meetings of the monk masses.   

**Q:**  Would the 14 members of the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཚོགས་འདུ] 1. The general name for the various types of Tibetan government assemblies. 2. Any assembly, e.g., the assembly (meeting) of monks in a college.">tsondu</a> attend the meeting of 16 khamtsen.   

**A:**  Yes.   

**Q:**  Then there were the drepa and the 4 <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཕྱག་སྦུག] A manager (of estates and endowments) of a monastic college or monastic khamtsen.">chabu</a>, right?   

**A:**  Yes. In addition to that, the representatives of the 16 <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཁང་ཚན] A monastic residential unit in which monks from specific geographic areas lived. These were corporate entities with property and internal officials. Some large khamtsen had smaller subordinate units called mi tshan. Khamtsen were part of tratsang (colleges). For example, Hamdong Khamtsen was part of Gomang College in Drepung Monastery.">khamtsen</a> would also come. This is like the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཚོགས་འདུ་རྒྱས་འཛོམས] The largest assembly of the traditional Tibetan government.">tsondu gyendzom</a> and there were altogether 32 members, but this assembly meets very infrequently.   

**Q:**  When there were some critical matters, they would call this meeting, right?   

**A:**  Yes.   

**Q:**  When you were the umdze, did such things happen that they had to call the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཚོགས་འདུ་རྒྱས་འཛོམས] The largest assembly of the traditional Tibetan government.">tsondu gyendzom</a>?   

**Q:**  Probably, such things didn't happen. I don't recall it.   

**Q:**  In the monastery, do you call it <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཚོགས་འདུ་རྒྱས་འཛོམས] The largest assembly of the traditional Tibetan government.">tsondu gyendzom</a> or 16 <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཁང་ཚན] A monastic residential unit in which monks from specific geographic areas lived. These were corporate entities with property and internal officials. Some large khamtsen had smaller subordinate units called mi tshan. Khamtsen were part of tratsang (colleges). For example, Hamdong Khamtsen was part of Gomang College in Drepung Monastery.">khamtsen</a>?   

**A:**  In our <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. གྲྭ་ཚང] A &quot;college&quot; within a monastery, for example, in Drepung Monastery there were four main tratsang: Gomang, Loseling, Deyang and Ngagpa. These tratsang were property owning corporate entities and included monks who were organized into residential dormitories called Khamtsen.">tratsang</a> we call it 16 khamtsen. That was the biggest meeting in the tratsang.   

**Q:**  Can you give me an example of the discussions held by the 14 <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཚོགས་འདུ] 1. The general name for the various types of Tibetan government assemblies. 2. Any assembly, e.g., the assembly (meeting) of monks in a college.">tsondu</a> members?   

**A:**  In truth, while I was part of` the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཚོགས་འདུ] 1. The general name for the various types of Tibetan government assemblies. 2. Any assembly, e.g., the assembly (meeting) of monks in a college.">tsondu</a>, I didn't pay much attention to it and really just sat there. The main things I worried about were the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཚོག] 1. An offering made of tsamba, butter and dry cheese in the shape of a cone. 2. A prayer assembly meeting in monasteries when all the monks come to an assembly hall and chant prayers together.">tshog</a> and education of monks, otherwise I didn't pay much attention. Actually, the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. དགེ་སྐོས] The main disciplinary official in a monastic college (tratsang).">gegö</a> and umdze were not like simple ones, [Tib. ལས་སླ་པོ་མ་རེད] since we hold the documents when the 14 members meet and we sit above the 5 <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཕྱག་སྦུག] A manager (of estates and endowments) of a monastic college or monastic khamtsen.">chabu</a>. The seating order in the tsondu would start form the abbot, uchö and among the uchö, the gegö takes the main incharge and then chabu, 2 <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. གཉེར་ཚང] 1. Storehouse. 2. Steward, person in charge of a storehouse. 3. A monastic official in charge of storerooms.">nyertsang</a>, then the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཁང་ཚན་དགེ་རྒན] The head official of a khamtsen.">khamtsen gegen</a> of the 4 <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. སྣ་ཆེན] The name used for the largest Khamtsen in Drepung (or Sera, or Ganden).">nachen</a>, [Tib. སྣ་ཆེན] etc.   

**Q:**  In terms of seating you were higher, but the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཕྱག་སྦུག] A manager (of estates and endowments) of a monastic college or monastic khamtsen.">chabu</a> holds the main power, right?   

**A:**  Yes. We don't medddle with politics because we didn't have experiences. And in the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཚོགས་འདུ] 1. The general name for the various types of Tibetan government assemblies. 2. Any assembly, e.g., the assembly (meeting) of monks in a college.">tsondu</a> there was also a little bit of things that the Khampas have loyalty to the Khampas and the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. བོད་པ] 1. A person from Central Tibet (tib. དབུས) or sometimes someone from political Tibet in contrast to persons from Kham and Amdo. 2. Böpa is also used nowadays as a general name for all ethnic Tibetans.">böba</a> have loyalty to the böba,[Tib. ཁམ་ཞེན་བོད་ཞེན]. For example, I am a <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. བོད་པ] 1. A person from Central Tibet (tib. དབུས) or sometimes someone from political Tibet in contrast to persons from Kham and Amdo. 2. Böpa is also used nowadays as a general name for all ethnic Tibetans.">böpa</a> and I would also think a little bit that if the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཕྱག་སྦུག] A manager (of estates and endowments) of a monastic college or monastic khamtsen.">chabu</a> were to be a böpa it would make some difference. So they would not trust us very much. But since we have the documents, they didn't have any choice but to go along with us, [Tib. བསྟུན]. Even if the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. དགེ་སྐོས] The main disciplinary official in a monastic college (tratsang).">gegö</a> is very knowledgeable, his term is only for 6 months, so it doesn't have a great influence. As for me, I only know some chanting prayers, but I didn't have a good knowledge on the main texts of <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. མཚན་ཉིད] Buddhist dialectics. This is taught after the six-year curriculum called düdra.">tsenyi</a>. I had the thought of studying and practcing the main texts and I studied tsenyi for a few years, but when the umdze position came open and they chose me I had to give up my study and I had to hold on my own duty on reciting and chanting prayers.   

**Q:**  How does the actual meeting of <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཚོགས་འདུ] 1. The general name for the various types of Tibetan government assemblies. 2. Any assembly, e.g., the assembly (meeting) of monks in a college.">tsondu</a> with 14 members work? And who preside it?   

**A:**  We all come and sit down and then have tea and then one of the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཕྱག་སྦུག] A manager (of estates and endowments) of a monastic college or monastic khamtsen.">chabu</a> says this is the reason for having the meeting today.   

**Q:**  Was there a fixed <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཕྱག་སྦུག] A manager (of estates and endowments) of a monastic college or monastic khamtsen.">chabu</a> who prside the meeting?   

**A:**  No, it depends on the capablity. Of the 4 <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཕྱག་སྦུག] A manager (of estates and endowments) of a monastic college or monastic khamtsen.">chabu</a>, the Hamdong chabu is mostly more capable and he says most of the things like asking "What is your opinion on this matter?" There was almost nobody says such as this is good or no good. This meeting was just to pass off the responsiblity on the tsondu. Actually, there was no way to say something and it is hard to find somebody saying this is good or bad because the chabu had already decided the matter.   

**Q:**  What is the term of the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཕྱག་སྦུག] A manager (of estates and endowments) of a monastic college or monastic khamtsen.">chabu</a>?   

**A:**  There was a term, but they hold it for many years. The <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཕྱག་སྦུག] A manager (of estates and endowments) of a monastic college or monastic khamtsen.">chabu</a> of Hamdong and Samlo are very capable and then the Gungru is capable, but the Bathi Khamtsen only has 6-7 monks because they didn't have the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. གྲྭ་རྒྱུན] Monks who came to Drepung, Ganden and Sera from far distances such as Kham and Amdo.">tragyün</a> for many years.   

**Q:**  Is Bathi from Mongolia?   

**A:**  No from <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. མཚོ་སྔོན] 1. Amdo. 2. Lake Kokonor.">Tsongön</a> [Tib. མཚོ་སྔོན] in Amdo. And since no <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. གྲྭ་རྒྱུན] Monks who came to Drepung, Ganden and Sera from far distances such as Kham and Amdo.">tragyün</a> were coming from there, the Khamtsen was almost empty (finished).   

**Q:**  Is there voting in the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཚོགས་འདུ] 1. The general name for the various types of Tibetan government assemblies. 2. Any assembly, e.g., the assembly (meeting) of monks in a college.">tsondu</a>?   

**A:**  No. No raising hands and voting, etc.   

**Q:**  Can the others say we don't agree with the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཕྱག་སྦུག] A manager (of estates and endowments) of a monastic college or monastic khamtsen.">chabu</a>'s idea?   

**A:**  Yes we can, but nobody is heeding [Tib. བརྩི་སྒོ]. If people spoke against the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཕྱག་སྦུག] A manager (of estates and endowments) of a monastic college or monastic khamtsen.">chabu</a> they would accumulate it and finally do something. For example, when the trouble of between lagyüpa and pechwa all those who had spoken for moving to the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཆོས་ར] The special grove (&quot;dharma grove&quot;) in monasteries where monks formally met to practice debating.">chöra</a> were expelled from the monastery. Similarly, the reason for the local government gave many <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཆོས་གཤིས] A &quot;religious&quot; estate held by a monastery or lama.">chöshi</a> is for assisting the study of <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. དཔེ་ཆ] Religious books/texts, scriptures.">pecha</a> the [Tib. slab pa slop gnyer]. But, it didn't help for this matter. We, the people working on that didn't do the right thing and we were storing away in the storerooms. Actually, we didn't have to store it. If they gave this directly to the monks, it would help them, but they don't. For example, in 1955 or 56 we asked that the monks livelihood in general is very difficult nowadays, and the pachawa monks have a hard time studying due to poor livelihood. Please give extra grain salary. We told many times to the chabu internally to please help us. Finally they gave 1 <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཁལ] A traditional volume measurement used for measuring grain in traditional Tibetan society. Sizes of this unit varied somewhat, but the official government khe (called mkhar ru or bstan dzin mkha ru) weighed about 28-31 pounds for barley. It was used to convey the size of fields. For example, a field said to be 10 khe in size meant that 10 khe of seed could be sown on that field.">khe</a> of grain extra for one year from Kyarpo Shiga. We thought of asking for this continually, but no hope at all, they had no intention of giving this regularly. We got a slip and picked up 1 khe from Kyarpo Estate [near Drepung] for that year. The <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. གཞིས་ཀ] A manorial estate.">shiga</a> was managed by the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. གྲྭ་ཚང] A &quot;college&quot; within a monastery, for example, in Drepung Monastery there were four main tratsang: Gomang, Loseling, Deyang and Ngagpa. These tratsang were property owning corporate entities and included monks who were organized into residential dormitories called Khamtsen.">tratsang</a> and they sent the shiü and they had total of yield 700,000 khe of grain.   

**Q:**  This must be in 1959, right?   

**A:**  Yes. I know this because I did the accounts every yearly. This was the total income of the tratsang. This included all those that had been lent out and owed and that actually on hand.   

**Q:**  How many <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཁལ] A traditional volume measurement used for measuring grain in traditional Tibetan society. Sizes of this unit varied somewhat, but the official government khe (called mkhar ru or bstan dzin mkha ru) weighed about 28-31 pounds for barley. It was used to convey the size of fields. For example, a field said to be 10 khe in size meant that 10 khe of seed could be sown on that field.">khe</a> of grain did you have in hand?   

**A:**  There was not much in hand.   

**Q:**  Did you have like 400, 000 <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཁལ] A traditional volume measurement used for measuring grain in traditional Tibetan society. Sizes of this unit varied somewhat, but the official government khe (called mkhar ru or bstan dzin mkha ru) weighed about 28-31 pounds for barley. It was used to convey the size of fields. For example, a field said to be 10 khe in size meant that 10 khe of seed could be sown on that field.">khe</a>?   

**A:**  No, we might not have even 100, 000 in hand. But most of this was just on paper like old loans which the Kashag send the edict to pay it with no interest in payment arrangements [Tib. རྒྱས་དཔྱད] like paying 10 <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཁལ] A traditional volume measurement used for measuring grain in traditional Tibetan society. Sizes of this unit varied somewhat, but the official government khe (called mkhar ru or bstan dzin mkha ru) weighed about 28-31 pounds for barley. It was used to convey the size of fields. For example, a field said to be 10 khe in size meant that 10 khe of seed could be sown on that field.">khe</a> yearly if they owed 1,000 khe of grain. And there was one loan called Barche, [Tib. བར་ཆད] which is if someone couldn't pay the loan in this year, they would charge the interest and add it on the catital.   

**Q:**  This is like charging interest on the interest, [Tib. སྐྱེད་ལ་སྐྱེད་རྒྱག], right?   

**A:**  Yes.   

**Q:**  How did you do the accounting?   

**A:**  We would make the yearly accounts using traditional Tibetan <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. རྡེའུ] The traditional method of Tibetan arithmetic that uses a board and a variety of items like beans, sticks and stones.">diu</a> system.   

**Q:**  The uchö have to attend this, right?   

**A:**  Yes.   

**Q:**  How did you do the accounting?   

**A:**  We used the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. རྡེའུ] The traditional method of Tibetan arithmetic that uses a board and a variety of items like beans, sticks and stones.">diu</a> system and we wrote the names of the different items like <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཁ་བཏགས] A Tibetan ceremonial scarf given to lamas, visitors, etc.">khata</a>, gold, silver, tea leaves, brown sugar on small playcards and did an accounting every month and we did once 6 month and then every year. The <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཕྱག་སྦུག] A manager (of estates and endowments) of a monastic college or monastic khamtsen.">chabu</a> and the grain steward, <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. འབྲུ་གཉེར] A steward (nyerpa) in charge of grain.">drunyer</a> [Tib. འབྲུ་གཉེར] keep an account record month by month on what they recieved in and paid out. And we then check their accounts every month. Every six months, the uchö meet with them and do the accounts for the entire six months, ending up with a listing of what they have in hand and what was spent and obtained. Then at the end of one year, there is another account for the entire year. At the end of three years, they have to do a 3 year account which is submitted to the Yigtsang. Therefore, we couldn't do it without having two clerks.   

**Q:**  When they do this accounting, did two of you, the uchö have to attend it?   

**A:**  Yes.   

**Q:**  Would they give you a copy of accounts?   

**A:**  Yes. In the past, the first auditing was done by Kündeling [Tib. ཀུན་བདེ་གླིང] and he would write down everything in our book in great detail. And also each of the grain steward who went to store the grain also had a book.   

**Q:**  Supposing a <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. གཞིས་ཀ] A manorial estate.">shiga</a> had 1,000 <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཁལ] A traditional volume measurement used for measuring grain in traditional Tibetan society. Sizes of this unit varied somewhat, but the official government khe (called mkhar ru or bstan dzin mkha ru) weighed about 28-31 pounds for barley. It was used to convey the size of fields. For example, a field said to be 10 khe in size meant that 10 khe of seed could be sown on that field.">khe</a> of the grain and when the grain steward stores the grain, would he just do it according to whatever number he was told or could he say that certain amount is actually missing?   

**A:**  If they got 1,000 khem, that is the actual number, so they will bring it as an income in the account and then they count the things that they have been spent and see how much is left.   

**Q:**  Did they write these on the paper and later they add them up ?   

**A:**  Yes. At that time, we don't meddle into it because they were the ones who receive the income and spent the expenses. We look at the account and calculate what came in and went out and what is left.   

**Q:**  Sometimes, the income and the expense might get unbalanced, right? If so what would you tell them?   

**A:**  Yes. If too much was spent from one category, then the uchö would warn the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཕྱག་སྦུག] A manager (of estates and endowments) of a monastic college or monastic khamtsen.">chabu</a> to be careful because they have to deliver the account to <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཡིག་ཚང] The highest office dealing with monastic and religious affairs in the traditional Tibetan government. It is often called the Ecclesiastic Office. It was headed by 4 fourth rank monk officials called Trunyichemmo. The senior Trunyichemmo was called Ta Lama.">Yigtsang</a> in three years. If something happened in the future, we will not be responsible because you were the people who receive the income and also spend the things.   

**Q:**  Do you have a fixed date for doing the monthly accounting in the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. གྲྭ་ཚང] A &quot;college&quot; within a monastery, for example, in Drepung Monastery there were four main tratsang: Gomang, Loseling, Deyang and Ngagpa. These tratsang were property owning corporate entities and included monks who were organized into residential dormitories called Khamtsen.">tratsang</a>?   

**A:**  It is done during a time when there is no <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཆོས་ར] The special grove (&quot;dharma grove&quot;) in monasteries where monks formally met to practice debating.">chöra</a>. There can be no accounting if the uchö are not present and the uchö have to go to chöra every day. The accounts are kept in a locked box. The <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. དགེ་སྐོས] The main disciplinary official in a monastic college (tratsang).">gegö</a> locks the locker and takes the key while the umdze puts his seal on the box. So there is no way of doing the accounting without the accounts. From the early time, they had made books for the accounts and it was also sealed. In general, when they serve <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. གྲྭ་ཇ] The prayer session sponsored by the tratsang (college) at which tea was served to its monks who attended.">traja</a> on the holy days, [Tib. དུས་བཟང] like 8th, 15th, 30th in gelugba system , they serve rice porridge. Normally they serve <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. རྩམ་པ] The traditional Tibetan staple food that consists of grain that is roasted (popped), usually in heated sand, and then ground into a flour.">tsamba</a> soup. When they do the accounting, if they notice that the official in charge had missed giving a porrige, they have the authority to make them do it at once again [ie. next day or so]. I had the respnonsibility, so if I didn't say something about missing the distribution, since this is for the benefit of the monks, it would become my non-virtious deed. Therefore, I worked hard though I didn't have any great knowledge. At this time, there was an incident while doing the accounting where the representatives of the monks said that the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཕྱག་སྦུག] A manager (of estates and endowments) of a monastic college or monastic khamtsen.">chabu</a> weren't doing their job properly and the case was filed to the Branch Judicial System where the Disputes were Settled, Gyöshib lakhung [Tib. གྱོད་ཞིབ་ལས་ཁུངས]. and the monks lost the case.   

**Q:**  When did this happen?   

**A:**  The heads of this office was Yuthok [Tib. གཡུ་ཐོག] Tsadora [Tib. ཚ་རྡོར་བ] <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. མཁན་ཆུང] A rank/title for monk officials that was equal to 4th rank (tib. རིམ་བཞི) officials in the lay aristocratic side of the traditional government bureaucracy.">khenjung</a>, Rasagyagyen [Tib. ར་ས་རྒྱ་རྒན]. So I went there and when they checked all the pledges, they could not find anything wrong with the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཕྱག་སྦུག] A manager (of estates and endowments) of a monastic college or monastic khamtsen.">chabu</a>'s work, so the monks lost. This was probably in 1955-56.   

**Q:**  What was their accusation?   

**A:**  The mass monks accused the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཕྱག་སྦུག] A manager (of estates and endowments) of a monastic college or monastic khamtsen.">chabu</a> that they are not doing good, but it seemed that they don't have substance to say. They didn't say anything to us. The main heads of the mass monks were Chabe <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཨ་མདོ] One of the three main Tibetan sub-ethnic areas. It is located in the northeast of the Tibetan Plateau mostly in today&#x27;s Qinghai Province. A person from Amdo is called an Amdowa.">Amdo</a> Tsütrim [Tib. ? tshul khrims]and Chabre Gompo [? mgon po].   

**Q:**  Was this about Takhare?   

**A:**  No, the case was against the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཕྱག་སྦུག] A manager (of estates and endowments) of a monastic college or monastic khamtsen.">chabu</a> and Hamdong drepa was the Takhare's gidru.   

**Q:**  What was the essence of the criticism? Were they saying that they are not paying the salary on time, or what?   

**A:**  The <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. གྲྭ་ཚང] A &quot;college&quot; within a monastery, for example, in Drepung Monastery there were four main tratsang: Gomang, Loseling, Deyang and Ngagpa. These tratsang were property owning corporate entities and included monks who were organized into residential dormitories called Khamtsen.">tratsang</a> had good <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཆོས་གཤིས] A &quot;religious&quot; estate held by a monastery or lama.">chöshi</a> and we have good income, but the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཕྱག་སྦུག] A manager (of estates and endowments) of a monastic college or monastic khamtsen.">chabu</a> aren't giving enough of it to the monks, like the proverb, the "eye medicine is not used for the eyes" so the monks are poor. The chabu have to do like the proverb, the "eye medicine should be used for the eyes" [Tib. མིག་སྨན་མིག་ཐོག]. For example, there was another incident that illustrates this stinginess. <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. སྒོ་མང] One of the large colleges in Drepung Monastery.">Gomang</a> has a park called Gomang Jangseb, [Tib. ལྕང་གསེབ] located at the east of the monastery where we had alot of wood which was sold to the Chinese for 70,000 <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ད་ཡང; ch. 大洋] A Chinese silver dollar that had the image of Yuan Shikai on its face. It was used by the Chinese government in Tibet in the 1950s because Tibetans did not accept Chinese paper currency.">dayang</a> before tjhe revolt. Again, there was a trouble. I said at the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཚོགས་འདུ] 1. The general name for the various types of Tibetan government assemblies. 2. Any assembly, e.g., the assembly (meeting) of monks in a college.">tsondu</a> with 14 members, we should give this money as the salary to the monks as each monk will get 7 dayang to help their livelihood and myself will also get the share. I said this like a joke because I don't know how to talk to win over there people. The chabu said "no, the tratsang has lots of expenses and we don't have enough money for the expense". At the end, they agreed to give 3 dayang per monk. I said, okay, but the extra money we should set up an endowment (not use it as expense) so I said we should set up an in charge committee called, "joint of eight <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. སྦུག་མཛོད] A manager/steward who was in charge of the estates of a monastery or monastic college.">bungdzö</a>" bungdzö gyedrel [Tib. བརྒྱད་སྦྲེལ]. This was to be consisted of 5 chabu, uchö and 1 clerk. We made a rule that none of us 8 were eligible to take loans from this. And if we lent it out to others, then the inner guarantor, [Tib. nang 'kyag] of this has to come from one of eight of us. The interest is to be 16% for one year. This was approved by the tsondu with 14 members. These rules were written in a pledge by the joint eight in charge and the pledge also included that all interest would be paid on the 3rd day of the 2nd month. This was when the interest for the year was due. We could collect the interest for one year. I acted as guarantor for one <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. དགེ་ཤེས] An advanced degree earned by scholar monks.">geshe</a> lharampa, [Tib. ལྷ་རམ་པ] for 1,000 <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. རྡོ་ཚད] A currency unit in traditional Tibet that was equal to 50 ngüsang.">dotse</a> for his geshe tonggo. [1,000 dayang is about 400 dotse] This was to be used for monk's salary, but nothing ever came from it since one year later the revolt arose a few months after this.   

**Q:**  Usually, when you give money loans was it given for 6 months?   

**Q:**  The <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. གྲྭ་ཚང] A &quot;college&quot; within a monastery, for example, in Drepung Monastery there were four main tratsang: Gomang, Loseling, Deyang and Ngagpa. These tratsang were property owning corporate entities and included monks who were organized into residential dormitories called Khamtsen.">tratsang</a> gives loan for 1 year, but the other lenders such as <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. དངུལ་གཉེར] Accountant, bookkeeper, cashier. Someone in charge of cash.">ngünyer</a> lent out only for 6 months. With them, the borrower also has to give a gift called shuten, [Tib. ཞུ་རྟེན] e.g., if you want to borrow 100 <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. སྲང] A unit of traditional Tibetan currency. It was also called ngüsang [tib. དངུལ་སྲང]. 50 nügsang = 1 dotse; 10 sho = 1 nügsang; 20 5-karma coins = 1 ngüsang. There were also paper currency notes of 7-sang, 25-sang, and 10-sang denominations.">sang</a>, then you have to give 5 sang as a gift. [This is the income for ngünye]. If one looks at how the government had given <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. གཞིས་ཀ] A manorial estate.">shiga</a> to the tratsang and the other incomes of the tratsang's, [loan interest] there is no reason for the monks have go around doing trade and business. For example, in addition to their alms and salary, the shidü also gets 12 <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཁལ] A traditional volume measurement used for measuring grain in traditional Tibetan society. Sizes of this unit varied somewhat, but the official government khe (called mkhar ru or bstan dzin mkha ru) weighed about 28-31 pounds for barley. It was used to convey the size of fields. For example, a field said to be 10 khe in size meant that 10 khe of seed could be sown on that field.">khe</a> of grain salary. But if we really look at what the tratsang did, the monks didn't get what they ought to get. So when their liveliohood became poor, they did reckless things. Though there was a good discipiline, but it didn't help.   

**Q:**  What happens if there is a fight about who should get a <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. 1. ཤག, 2. ཞག] 1. The apartment/room of a monk. 2. The butter fat that coagulates on the top of butter-tea when the tea is left to sit for some time.

**A:**  If it's in the monastery they don't. The Khamtsen settles this. But with respect to their houses in Lhasa; <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. སྒོ་མང] One of the large colleges in Drepung Monastery.">Gomang</a> Khangsar [Tib. སྒོ་མང་ཁང་གསར] Jayang shar [Tib. འཇམ་དབྱངས་ཤར] Jayang kyil [Tib. དཀྱིལ] Jayang nub, Tashilunpo Tara [Tib. རྟ་ར] [stable] these are belonged to the tratsang.
