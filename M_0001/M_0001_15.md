**Q:**  Did the Hor Mitsen have <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཕྱག་མཛོད] A senior manager/treasurer of an aristocratic or monastic estate, or the senior manager/treasurer of an aristocratic family or a monastic unit. Generally chandzö handled both internal and external issues and were considered higher in power and status than nyerpa (stewards), who typically only handled the storerooms.">chandzö</a>?   

**A:**  Yes, they had the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཕྱག་མཛོད] A senior manager/treasurer of an aristocratic or monastic estate, or the senior manager/treasurer of an aristocratic family or a monastic unit. Generally chandzö handled both internal and external issues and were considered higher in power and status than nyerpa (stewards), who typically only handled the storerooms.">chandzö</a> and if the monks got into a fight, they would hold the meeting called the four chandzö and <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. གཉེར་པ] A steward or manager. In some monasteries, the nyerpa was in charge of storerooms under the authority of a higher manager called a chandzö.">nyerpa</a>, Nyerchagshi [Tib. གཉེར་ཕྱག་བཞི]. If they couldn't decide the matter, they would report to the tsondu. I forgot all these things because it has been long time.   

**Q:**  In Tsokhag, [Tib. མཚོ་ཁ་བ] Mitsen, they had <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཕྱག་མཛོད] A senior manager/treasurer of an aristocratic or monastic estate, or the senior manager/treasurer of an aristocratic family or a monastic unit. Generally chandzö handled both internal and external issues and were considered higher in power and status than nyerpa (stewards), who typically only handled the storerooms.">chandzö</a> and after being a chandzö, then you could speak out in the tsondu. So the Hor and Tsokhag were same, right?   

**A:**  Yes, we came from the Central Tibet [Tib. བོད་རིགས], so we don't know about the internal ideology, but we didn't have to deal with [Tib. ཇུས་གཏོགས] anything except the grain <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. གཉེར་པ] A steward or manager.

If you came from the north, Hor, then you had to do everything.   

**Q:**  For example, in Hor Mitsen if you were a <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. བོད་པ] 1. A person from Central Tibet (tib. དབུས) or sometimes someone from political Tibet in contrast to persons from Kham and Amdo. 2.

The general name for the various types of Tibetan government assemblies. 2. Any assembly, e.g., the assembly (meeting) of monks in a college.">tsondu</a> and if you came from Hor then you had to deal with the tsondu. What if there were Khampas? Did they have to deal with the tsondu?   

**A:**  The Khampas won't get admission in to the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. མི་ཚན] A sub-unit of a khamtsen.">mitsen</a>. The mitsen was only for the Horpa.   

**Q:**  In Hor Mitsen, they would give admission mainly to the Horpa and 5 <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. བོད་པ] 1. A person from Central Tibet (tib. དབུས) or sometimes someone from political Tibet in contrast to persons from Kham and Amdo. 2. Böpa is also used nowadays as a general name for all ethnic Tibetans.">böpa</a> would gain admission a year.   

**A:**  Yes.   

**Q:**  In the Hor Mitsen, there were no Khampas, Mongolian and <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཨ་མདོ] One of the three main Tibetan sub-ethnic areas.

**Q:**  When did the cashiers give the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. གཏོང་སྒོ] A monastic obligation to provide the food and other necessary items served at a monastic prayer assembly meeting or some other rite; this was often a required obligation for monastic officials at the end of their term of office.">tonggo</a> called Nyünyer Düsang [Tib. དངུལ་གཉེར་དུས་བཟང]?   

**A:**  They would supply it in the month commemorating the Birth, Enlightenment and Parinirvana of the Buddha, Sakadawa [Tib. ས་ག་ཟླ་བ]. And the cashier would supply tea in the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཁང་ཚན] A monastic residential unit in which monks from specific geographic areas lived. These were corporate entities with property and internal officials. Some large khamtsen had smaller subordinate units called mi tshan. Khamtsen were part of tratsang (colleges).

**A:**  Yes.   

**Q:**  The cashier's <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. གཏོང་སྒོ] A monastic obligation to provide the food and other necessary items served at a monastic prayer assembly meeting or some other rite; this was often a required obligation for monastic officials at the end of their term of office.">tonggo</a> called Ngünyer Düsang would be supplied on the religious festival days?

In some monasteries, the nyerpa was in charge of storerooms under the authority of a higher manager called a chandzö.">nyerpa</a> [Tib. ཉིས་སྦྲེལ] and a joint of three nyerpa [Tib. སུམ་སྦྲེལ]?   

**A:**  Yes.   

**Q:**  So the cashiers should give the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. གཏོང་སྒོ] A monastic obligation to provide the food and other necessary items served at a monastic prayer assembly meeting or some other rite; this was often a required obligation for monastic officials at the end of their term of office.">tonggo</a> on all of the religious festivals?   

**A:**  Yes.   

**Q:**  How many years was the term for the cashier?   

**A:**  I think the cashier's term was for three years.   

**Q:**  At the time you finished your turn for the cashier, were there any <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. གཏོང་སྒོ] A monastic obligation to provide the food and other necessary items served at a monastic prayer assembly meeting or some other rite; this was often a required obligation for monastic officials at the end of their term of office.">tonggo</a> that should be supplied for 4 days?   

**A:**  After you finished your turn for the cashier, then the new cashier would come. Anyhow, they had to supply the tsomja. They could not miss it.   

**Q:**  The Nyerpa Düsang would be supplied for 4 days at the time of finishing <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. གཉེར་པ] A steward or manager. In some monasteries, the nyerpa was in charge of storerooms under the authority of a higher manager called a chandzö.">nyerpa</a>?   

**A:**  Yes, there was also the Tara, Drölmai Düsang [Tib. སྒྲོལ་མའི་དུས་བཟང] for 4 days.   

**Q:**  The cashier would supply the düsang or what?   

**A:**  No, this would be supplied by the Tatra Labrang.   

**Q:**  The <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. སྟག་བྲག] The regent of Tibet who replaced Reting in 1941 and served until 1950 when the 14th Dalai Lama assumed power.">Taktra</a> Labrang would supply in the 10th month, right?   

**A:**  They would supply it on the 1st - 4th of 10th month.   

**Q:**  On which date would the Nyerpa Düsang be?   

**A:**  It would be on the 12th -15th of 10th month.   

**Q:**  That was the 10th Tibetan month?

**A:**  Normally, they would supply the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. གཏོང་སྒོ] A monastic obligation to provide the food and other necessary items served at a monastic prayer assembly meeting or some other rite; this was often a required obligation for monastic officials at the end of their term of office.">tonggo</a> separately. For example, if there were two cashiers or three cashiers or even if there were four cashiers, they would lend their capital as a loan in the north. At the time of supplying for the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཚོམ་ཇ] The name of the khamtsen&#x27;s prayer assembly meetings at which tea was served.">tsomja</a> then they would come to supply it.   

**Q:**  For example, there was a group of two cashiers and a group of three cashiers and if the Sakadawa <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. གཏོང་སྒོ] A monastic obligation to provide the food and other necessary items served at a monastic prayer assembly meeting or some other rite; this was often a required obligation for monastic officials at the end of their term of office.">tonggo</a> was the turn of the group of two cashiers, the turn for supplying the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཚོམ་ཇ] The name of the khamtsen&#x27;s prayer assembly meetings at which tea was served.">tsomja</a> would not reach on the same day for the group of three <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. གཉེར་པ] A steward or manager. In some monasteries, the nyerpa was in charge of storerooms under the authority of a higher manager called a chandzö.">nyerpa</a>, right?   

**A:**  Yes, the joint of three cashiers wouldn't reach the turn for <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཚོམ་ཇ] The name of the khamtsen&#x27;s prayer assembly meetings at which tea was served.">tsomja</a> on that day. For example, if the group of three cashiers would supply the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. གཏོང་སྒོ] A monastic obligation to provide the food and other necessary items served at a monastic prayer assembly meeting or some other rite; this was often a required obligation for monastic officials at the end of their term of office.">tonggo</a> on the Sagadawa, the group of the two cashiers wouldn't meddle with them.

**Q:**  The umdze of the Ngagpa didn't know the voice called dzoke, [Tib. མཛོ་སྐད], right?   

**A:**  Yes, the umdze of the Ngagpa didn't know the dzoke.

**A:**  There were two kinds of voices one was the natural voice [Tib. རང་སྐད] and the other was the dzoke. And in Sera, the dzoke was called made up voice, Jöke [Tib. བཅོས་སྐད].   

**Q:**  So in Drepung they called it dzoke and in Sera they called it Jöke?

The exorcism [Tib. གཏོར་རྒྱག] of Mönlam should be done by the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. རྣམ་རྒྱལ] 1. A person&#x27;s name. 2.

The assembly hall for the monastery as a whole.">tsogchen</a> umdze but there was a monk bodyguard of the Dalai Lama Simgag [Tib. གཟིམ་འགག] who was the tsogchen umdze and he had a very good voice, he was very famous. There was <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. གྲྭ་ཚང] A &quot;college&quot; within a monastery, for example, in Drepung Monastery there were four main tratsang: Gomang, Loseling, Deyang and Ngagpa. These tratsang were property owning corporate entities and included monks who were organized into residential dormitories called Khamtsen.">tratsang</a> umdze in replace of me who didn't know the dzoke.   

**Q:**  Why didn't he know the dzoke?   

**A:**  Because our <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. གྲྭ་ཚང] A &quot;college&quot; within a monastery, for example, in Drepung Monastery there were four main tratsang: Gomang, Loseling, Deyang and Ngagpa. These tratsang were property owning corporate entities and included monks who were organized into residential dormitories called Khamtsen.">tratsang</a> didn't need the dzoke and we use our own natural voice. We used the natural voice for the prayer chanting with long tones [Tib. འདོན་རྟ་དབྱངས]. But they would use dzoke for praying in tsogchen.   

**Q:**  If you get selected for the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཚོགས་ཆེན] The main assembly hall of a monastery. The assembly hall for the monastery as a whole.">tsogchen</a> umdze then you should learn the dzoke?   

**A:**  Yes, you should learn the dzoke. I did the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. གྲྭ་ཚང] A &quot;college&quot; within a monastery, for example, in Drepung Monastery there were four main tratsang: Gomang, Loseling, Deyang and Ngagpa. These tratsang were property owning corporate entities and included monks who were organized into residential dormitories called Khamtsen.">tratsang</a> umdze for 9 years. After two years after I became umdze, I learned dzoke.   

**Q:**  Do you need to find a <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. དགེ་རྒན] 1. Teacher in a school. 2. In monastic settings it also refers to an adult monk who acted as a guardian to a younger monk. In such cases, the younger monk typically lived in the gegen&#x27;s apartment (shag). In monasteries, however, it could also mean a real teacher, or the monk who served as the guarantor for a new monk.">gegen</a> to learn the dzoke?   

**A:**  No, you didn't need a gegen. Everyday, I practiced the dzoke and finally the right sound came out. I practiced dzoke by my own. In 1980 I went for a pilgrimage to the Gemphel Utse [Tib. དགེ་འཕེལ་དབུ་རྩེ] in Drepung and I met the Ngagpa umdze and he told me to come to Drepung I will get you in. But, I didn't go because I thought that I was expelled, so how could I go back. Actually, I was capable for being an umdze. I forgot a little bit, but I learned when I was child so I can learn it again and it is not hard. We didn't do any tantric ritual [Tib. སྔགས་ཆོག]. But in the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཇོ་ཁང] A most famous temple in Lhasa that houses a holy statue of the Buddha. It is often used to mean the Tsuglagang Temple of which it is a part.">Jokhang</a> we had to do the tantric ritual and I taught them since I came here. In the Jokhang they are doing the rituals on the 10th and the 25th [Tib. tses bcu nyer lnag].   

**Q:**  In the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཇོ་ཁང] A most famous temple in Lhasa that houses a holy statue of the Buddha. It is often used to mean the Tsuglagang Temple of which it is a part.">Jokhang</a> they had the [rituals of] all the Buddhist sects?   

**A:**  Yes.   

**Q:**  Today there was a big assembly and there were many monks. I don't know why?   

**A:**  I think there are some other monks and we didn't start the assembly yet. Since I came here I taught them how to do the ritual. I have 10 pupil to which I taught tantric ritual. While I was ill they took turn for the umdze.   

**Q:**  They were skillful in chanting prayers [Tib. འདོན་བཟང]?   

**A:**  Yes, when they were taking turns it was very good. There were different pupils between the old society and now. In the past, when you reach the turn for the umdze, then that monk would be very attentive on prayers. Nowadays they are not attentive and they are like just working for the tax.   

**Q:**  In the past, did you mean the monks were attentive on clothes or they were attentive on learning?   

**A:**  They would study very hard and they were thinking that I will study hard to be the umdze. Nowadays they are not attentive on learning because umdze is only for starting prayers. They don't have the privilege like the old society.   

**Q:**  In the past, the umdze had a good privilege?   

**A:**  Yes, umdze had a good privilege. All of the money for requesting to lead the prayer, dönkül, [Tib. འདོན་སྐུལ] goes to the umdze. Nowadays, the money for requesting prayer goes to common monks.   

**Q:**  The money for the dönkül goes to umdze and the money or the clothes offered for dedication for the deceased, the Ngöten [Tib. བསྔོ་རྟེན] goes where?   

**A:**  The Ngöten goes to the Lamas and abbots.   

**Q:**  The money for dönkül goes to umdze?   

**A:**  In the past, the money for dönkül [during the Mönlam] goes to umdze but not now. I think in the monastery the money for dönkül goes to umdze.   

**Q:**  Last time, they told me that the money for dönkül and ngöten went to individuals and they didn't double their alms shares [for the umdze]?   

**A:**  That's right.   

**Q:**  When you say the money goes to the individual, do you mean the money for dönkül goes to umdze and the ngöten goes to Lama and abbot?   

**A:**  Yes that's right.   

**Q:**  They didn't offer it to the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. དགེ་སྐོས] The main disciplinary official in a monastic college (tratsang).">gegö</a>?   

**A:**  No, but nowadays they might offer it to the gegö. I am not so sure. The money for dönkül went only to the umdze. The assembly wouldn't be able to do the prayer in the request list. Because after the tea was served in assembly then they won't do the prayer. In the assembly the umdze would read the name of prayers while monks were drinking tea. Reading the name of the prayer is considered as good as reciting the prayer.   

**Q:**  For example, you had to be the grain <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. གཉེར་པ] A steward or manager.

**A:**  Yes, I had to bring the tsamba.   

**Q:**  It is quite light?   

**A:**  Yes, it is light.   

**Q:**  Later, they changed it into cookies?   

**A:**  At first, the grain <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. གཉེར་པ] A steward or manager. In some monasteries, the nyerpa was in charge of storerooms under the authority of a higher manager called a chandzö.">nyerpa</a> offered 4 cookies and after that it went up to 10-12 cookies for each monk. After you finished three years term for grain nyerpa and you would get a few <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཁལ] A traditional volume measurement used for measuring grain in traditional Tibetan society.

**Q:**  The <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. གཉེར་པ] A steward or manager. In some monasteries, the nyerpa was in charge of storerooms under the authority of a higher manager called a chandzö.">nyerpa</a> would leave the salary here?   

**A:**  Yes, because there was no capital for the cookies so they will leave the grain salary as for capital for making cookies. That's how it was. This was all done voluntarily. Nobody forced them to do that.   

**Q:**  As for the relationship between the great monastic seats, <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. གདན་ས] A &quot;Monastic Seat,&quot; usually refers to the three Monastic Seats: Drepung, Sera and Ganden Monasteries.">densa</a>, [Tib. གདན་ས] and the branch monastery [Tib. གཞིས་དགོན].

When the büdü came back, if they did well then the Lama would get Lama's rank and the chandzö will get the rank of tratsang chöndze. The nyerpa would get the rank of <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. དགེ་སྐོས] The main disciplinary official in a monastic college (tratsang).">gegö</a> and they didn't have to give the tonggo.   

**Q:**  If the monk came to get the admission to Drepung from a branch monastery he would not be considered as newly admission, right?
