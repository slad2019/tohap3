**Q:**  Did the Hor Mitsen have <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. ཕྱག་མཛོད] A senior manager/treasurer of an aristocratic or monastic estate, or the senior manager/treasurer of an aristocratic family or a monastic unit. Generally chandzö handled both internal and external issues and were considered higher in power and status than nyerpa (stewards), who typically only handled the storerooms.">chandzö</span>?   

**A:**  Yes, they had the <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. ཕྱག་མཛོད] A senior manager/treasurer of an aristocratic or monastic estate, or the senior manager/treasurer of an aristocratic family or a monastic unit. Generally chandzö handled both internal and external issues and were considered higher in power and status than nyerpa (stewards), who typically only handled the storerooms.">chandzö</span> and if the monks got into a fight, they would hold the meeting called the four chandzö and <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. གཉེར་པ] A steward or manager. In some monasteries, the nyerpa was in charge of storerooms under the authority of a higher manager called a chandzö.">nyerpa</span>, Nyerchagshi [Tib. གཉེར་ཕྱག་བཞི]. If they couldn't decide the matter, they would report to the tsondu. I forgot all these things because it has been long time.   

**Q:**  In Tsokhag, [Tib. མཚོ་ཁ་བ] Mitsen, they had <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. ཕྱག་མཛོད] A senior manager/treasurer of an aristocratic or monastic estate, or the senior manager/treasurer of an aristocratic family or a monastic unit. Generally chandzö handled both internal and external issues and were considered higher in power and status than nyerpa (stewards), who typically only handled the storerooms.">chandzö</span> and after being a chandzö, then you could speak out in the tsondu. So the Hor and Tsokhag were same, right?   

**A:**  Yes, we came from the Central Tibet [Tib. བོད་རིགས], so we don't know about the internal ideology, but we didn't have to deal with [Tib. ཇུས་གཏོགས] anything except the grain <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. གཉེར་པ] A steward or manager.

Did they have to deal with the tsondu?   

**A:**  The Khampas won't get admission in to the <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. མི་ཚན] A sub-unit of a khamtsen.">mitsen</span>. The mitsen was only for the Horpa.   

**Q:**  In Hor Mitsen, they would give admission mainly to the Horpa and 5 <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. བོད་པ] 1.

**A:**  They would supply it in the month commemorating the Birth, Enlightenment and Parinirvana of the Buddha, Sakadawa [Tib. ས་ག་ཟླ་བ]. And the cashier would supply tea in the <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. ཁང་ཚན] A monastic residential unit in which monks from specific geographic areas lived. These were corporate entities with property and internal officials. Some large khamtsen had smaller subordinate units called mi tshan. Khamtsen were part of tratsang (colleges).

**A:**  Yes.   

**Q:**  So the cashiers should give the <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. གཏོང་སྒོ] A monastic obligation to provide the food and other necessary items served at a monastic prayer assembly meeting or some other rite; this was often a required obligation for monastic officials at the end of their term of office.">tonggo</span> on all of the religious festivals?

For example, if there were two cashiers or three cashiers or even if there were four cashiers, they would lend their capital as a loan in the north. At the time of supplying for the <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. ཚོམ་ཇ] The name of the khamtsen&#x27;s prayer assembly meetings at which tea was served.">tsomja</span> then they would come to supply it.

The name of the Dalai Lama&#x27;s monastery located in the Potala Palace [tib. rnam rgyal grwa tshamg].">Namgyal</span> [Tib. རྣམ་རྒྱལ] Tratsang and the Ngagpa. In the old society, the <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. ཚོགས་ཆེན] The main assembly hall of a monastery. The assembly hall for the monastery as a whole.">tsogchen</span> umdze could be done by the monks who had a good voice whether in Lama <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. རྒྱུད་པ] The two Tantric Colleges in Lhasa: the Upper Tantric College and the Lower Tantric College.">Gyüpa</span> or others since they got the approval from the Dalai Lama. The Mönlam umdze didn't have to come from Drepung.   

**Q:**  So any one can do the Mönlam <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. དབུ་མཛད] The name of the chant/prayer leader in a monastery.">Umdze</span>?   

**A:**  The monks who had good voice and got the approval from the Dalai Lama could do it. In the past, we didn't do the <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. ཚོགས་ཆེན] The main assembly hall of a monastery. The assembly hall for the monastery as a whole.">tsogchen</span> umdze but there was a monk bodyguard of the Dalai Lama Simgag [Tib. གཟིམ་འགག] who was the tsogchen umdze and he had a very good voice, he was very famous. There was <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. གྲྭ་ཚང] A &quot;college&quot; within a monastery, for example, in Drepung Monastery there were four main tratsang: Gomang, Loseling, Deyang and Ngagpa. These tratsang were property owning corporate entities and included monks who were organized into residential dormitories called Khamtsen.">tratsang</span> umdze in replace of me who didn't know the dzoke.   

**Q:**  Why didn't he know the dzoke?   

**A:**  Because our <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. གྲྭ་ཚང] A &quot;college&quot; within a monastery, for example, in Drepung Monastery there were four main tratsang: Gomang, Loseling, Deyang and Ngagpa. These tratsang were property owning corporate entities and included monks who were organized into residential dormitories called Khamtsen.">tratsang</span> didn't need the dzoke and we use our own natural voice. We used the natural voice for the prayer chanting with long tones [Tib. འདོན་རྟ་དབྱངས]. But they would use dzoke for praying in tsogchen.   

**Q:**  If you get selected for the <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. ཚོགས་ཆེན] The main assembly hall of a monastery. The assembly hall for the monastery as a whole.">tsogchen</span> umdze then you should learn the dzoke?   

**A:**  Yes, you should learn the dzoke. I did the <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. གྲྭ་ཚང] A &quot;college&quot; within a monastery, for example, in Drepung Monastery there were four main tratsang: Gomang, Loseling, Deyang and Ngagpa. These tratsang were property owning corporate entities and included monks who were organized into residential dormitories called Khamtsen.">tratsang</span> umdze for 9 years. After two years after I became umdze, I learned dzoke.   

**Q:**  Do you need to find a <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. དགེ་རྒན] 1. Teacher in a school. 2. In monastic settings it also refers to an adult monk who acted as a guardian to a younger monk. In such cases, the younger monk typically lived in the gegen&#x27;s apartment (shag). In monasteries, however, it could also mean a real teacher, or the monk who served as the guarantor for a new monk.">gegen</span> to learn the dzoke?   

**A:**  No, you didn't need a gegen. Everyday, I practiced the dzoke and finally the right sound came out. I practiced dzoke by my own. In 1980 I went for a pilgrimage to the Gemphel Utse [Tib. དགེ་འཕེལ་དབུ་རྩེ] in Drepung and I met the Ngagpa umdze and he told me to come to Drepung I will get you in. But, I didn't go because I thought that I was expelled, so how could I go back. Actually, I was capable for being an umdze. I forgot a little bit, but I learned when I was child so I can learn it again and it is not hard. We didn't do any tantric ritual [Tib. སྔགས་ཆོག]. But in the <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. ཇོ་ཁང] A most famous temple in Lhasa that houses a holy statue of the Buddha. It is often used to mean the Tsuglagang Temple of which it is a part.">Jokhang</span> we had to do the tantric ritual and I taught them since I came here. In the Jokhang they are doing the rituals on the 10th and the 25th [Tib. tses bcu nyer lnag].   

**Q:**  In the <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. ཇོ་ཁང] A most famous temple in Lhasa that houses a holy statue of the Buddha. It is often used to mean the Tsuglagang Temple of which it is a part.">Jokhang</span> they had the [rituals of] all the Buddhist sects?   

**A:**  Yes.   

**Q:**  Today there was a big assembly and there were many monks. I don't know why?   

**A:**  I think there are some other monks and we didn't start the assembly yet. Since I came here I taught them how to do the ritual. I have 10 pupil to which I taught tantric ritual. While I was ill they took turn for the umdze.   

**Q:**  They were skillful in chanting prayers [Tib. འདོན་བཟང]?   

**A:**  Yes, when they were taking turns it was very good. There were different pupils between the old society and now. In the past, when you reach the turn for the umdze, then that monk would be very attentive on prayers. Nowadays they are not attentive and they are like just working for the tax.   

**Q:**  In the past, did you mean the monks were attentive on clothes or they were attentive on learning?   

**A:**  They would study very hard and they were thinking that I will study hard to be the umdze. Nowadays they are not attentive on learning because umdze is only for starting prayers. They don't have the privilege like the old society.   

**Q:**  In the past, the umdze had a good privilege?   

**A:**  Yes, umdze had a good privilege. All of the money for requesting to lead the prayer, dönkül, [Tib. འདོན་སྐུལ] goes to the umdze. Nowadays, the money for requesting prayer goes to common monks.   

**Q:**  The money for the dönkül goes to umdze and the money or the clothes offered for dedication for the deceased, the Ngöten [Tib. བསྔོ་རྟེན] goes where?   

**A:**  The Ngöten goes to the Lamas and abbots.   

**Q:**  The money for dönkül goes to umdze?   

**A:**  In the past, the money for dönkül [during the Mönlam] goes to umdze but not now. I think in the monastery the money for dönkül goes to umdze.   

**Q:**  Last time, they told me that the money for dönkül and ngöten went to individuals and they didn't double their alms shares [for the umdze]?   

**A:**  That's right.   

**Q:**  When you say the money goes to the individual, do you mean the money for dönkül goes to umdze and the ngöten goes to Lama and abbot?   

**A:**  Yes that's right.   

**Q:**  They didn't offer it to the <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. དགེ་སྐོས] The main disciplinary official in a monastic college (tratsang).">gegö</span>?   

**A:**  No, but nowadays they might offer it to the gegö. I am not so sure. The money for dönkül went only to the umdze. The assembly wouldn't be able to do the prayer in the request list. Because after the tea was served in assembly then they won't do the prayer. In the assembly the umdze would read the name of prayers while monks were drinking tea. Reading the name of the prayer is considered as good as reciting the prayer.   

**Q:**  For example, you had to be the grain <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. གཉེར་པ] A steward or manager.

**A:**  Yes, I had to bring the tsamba.   

**Q:**  It is quite light?   

**A:**  Yes, it is light.   

**Q:**  Later, they changed it into cookies?   

**A:**  At first, the grain <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. གཉེར་པ] A steward or manager. In some monasteries, the nyerpa was in charge of storerooms under the authority of a higher manager called a chandzö.">nyerpa</span> offered 4 cookies and after that it went up to 10-12 cookies for each monk.

**A:**  Yes, because there was no capital for the cookies so they will leave the grain salary as for capital for making cookies. That's how it was. This was all done voluntarily. Nobody forced them to do that.
