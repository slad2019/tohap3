**A:**  At that time, I was a child and I just went to the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཚོགས] 1. A prayer assembly meeting in monasteries when all the monks come to an assembly hall and chant prayers together. 2. An offering made of tsamba, butter and dry cheese in the shape of a cone.">tsog</a> and the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. chöra (ཆོས་ར)] The walled-in grove in monasteries (monastic colleges) where monks go to study/practice debating.">dharma grove</a>, <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཆོས་ར] The special grove (&quot;dharma grove&quot;) in monasteries where monks formally met to practice debating.">chöra</a> [Tib. ཆོས་ར] but I didn't have any idea.   

**Q:**  You didn't understand what they were debating, right?   

**A:**  Yes, I didn't understand what their debate was about. I didn't know the system of the dharma and I didn't know what bad things were happening then.   

**Q:**  Did you have a separate place to sit for the monks like you who were not <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. དཔེ་ཆ་བ] A monk studying the monastic philosophical curriculum. A scholar monk.">pechawa</a>?   

**A:**  When the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཆོས་ར] The special grove (&quot;dharma grove&quot;) in monasteries where monks formally met to practice debating.">chöra</a> started, there was a separate place to sit. In the chöra during the 16 years, there were 16 different places to sit according to your grade [Tib. འཛིན་གྲྭ] level. After 16 years, then all the monks would sit together. During the daytime, in one <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཚོགས] 1. A prayer assembly meeting in monasteries when all the monks come to an assembly hall and chant prayers together. 2. An offering made of tsamba, butter and dry cheese in the shape of a cone.">tsog</a>, all the monks would gather together. When we came to the chöra, the monks would sit according to their grades and they will start <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. མཚན་ཉིད] Buddhist dialectics. This is taught after the six-year curriculum called düdra.">tsenyi</a> debate and when the prayer started, all the monks would gather together.   

**Q:**  Today, I would like to ask you about when you were staying in <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. སྒོ་མང] One of the large colleges in Drepung Monastery.">Gomang</a> [Tib. སྒོ་མང], how much salary you would get and from where did you get? Some of the salary would be paid from the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. གྲྭ་ཚང] A &quot;college&quot; within a monastery, for example, in Drepung Monastery there were four main tratsang: Gomang, Loseling, Deyang and Ngagpa. These tratsang were property owning corporate entities and included monks who were organized into residential dormitories called Khamtsen.">tratsang</a> and some salary would be paid from the Committee Consisting of Abbots, Rigdra [Tib. རིགས་གྲྭ] and some of them were paid from the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. སྤྱི་བསོ] The head managers/stewards of monasteries as a whole, especially the large Gelugpa monasteries like Sera and Drepung.">jiso</a> and there were different places from where you can get the salary, so can you tell me one by one about the salary?   

**A:**  No, I can't tell you.   

**Q:**  I mean the grain salary?   

**A:**  I can tell you about the grain salary.   

**Q:**  For example, for the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. སྒོ་མང] One of the large colleges in Drepung Monastery.">Gomang</a> Tratsang, how much grain salary would they pay in one year?   

**A:**  In the past, they would pay one 1 <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཁལ] A traditional volume measurement used for measuring grain in traditional Tibetan society. Sizes of this unit varied somewhat, but the official government khe (called mkhar ru or bstan dzin mkha ru) weighed about 28-31 pounds for barley. It was used to convey the size of fields. For example, a field said to be 10 khe in size meant that 10 khe of seed could be sown on that field.">khe</a> of grain in a year. And in a period of time before the revolt they paid 3 khe of grain. That's all what they get.   

**Q:**  The <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. གྲྭ་ཚང] A &quot;college&quot; within a monastery, for example, in Drepung Monastery there were four main tratsang: Gomang, Loseling, Deyang and Ngagpa. These tratsang were property owning corporate entities and included monks who were organized into residential dormitories called Khamtsen.">tratsang</a> would pay 3 <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཁལ] A traditional volume measurement used for measuring grain in traditional Tibetan society. Sizes of this unit varied somewhat, but the official government khe (called mkhar ru or bstan dzin mkha ru) weighed about 28-31 pounds for barley. It was used to convey the size of fields. For example, a field said to be 10 khe in size meant that 10 khe of seed could be sown on that field.">khe</a> of grain and how much the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. སྤྱི་བསོ] The head managers/stewards of monasteries as a whole, especially the large Gelugpa monasteries like Sera and Drepung.">jiso</a> would pay?   

**A:**  The Drepung <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. སྤྱི་བསོ] The head managers/stewards of monasteries as a whole, especially the large Gelugpa monasteries like Sera and Drepung.">jiso</a> would pay 2 <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཁལ] A traditional volume measurement used for measuring grain in traditional Tibetan society. Sizes of this unit varied somewhat, but the official government khe (called mkhar ru or bstan dzin mkha ru) weighed about 28-31 pounds for barley. It was used to convey the size of fields. For example, a field said to be 10 khe in size meant that 10 khe of seed could be sown on that field.">khe</a> of grain in a year. The jiso was saying that they paid 2 khe of grain, but actually, there wasn't 20 <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. བྲེ] A unit of traditional volume measurement [a container] in Tibet, 20 of which typically equaled one khe or bo [also a container], although in some areas there were only 16 dre in one khe.">dre</a> [Tib. བྲེ] per khe, there was just 13 dre and a few phü [Tib. འཕུལ] per khe. It was a small bo [Tib. འབོ] which was almost smaller by three times than the regular bo [khe].   

**Q:**  So all together, they would pay you about 27 <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. བྲེ] A unit of traditional volume measurement [a container] in Tibet, 20 of which typically equaled one khe or bo [also a container], although in some areas there were only 16 dre in one khe.">dre</a> right?   

**A:**  Yes.   

**Q:**  Were there any other who would pay the grain salary?   

**A:**  All the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. གྲྭ་ཚང] A &quot;college&quot; within a monastery, for example, in Drepung Monastery there were four main tratsang: Gomang, Loseling, Deyang and Ngagpa. These tratsang were property owning corporate entities and included monks who were organized into residential dormitories called Khamtsen.">tratsang</a> would pay the grain salary.   

**Q:**  What about from the Rigdra?   

**A:**  From the Rigdra, they won't pay the grain salary measured in bo. In the past, they would give roasted barley for the salary. Later, they didn't give the roasted barley and they gave <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. རྩམ་པ] The traditional Tibetan staple food that consists of grain that is roasted (popped), usually in heated sand, and then ground into a flour.">tsamba</a>. When they gave the tsamba for the salary, they would measure the tsamba in a wooden utensil with a handle called <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཟླ་ཟོ] A wooden container used as a measurement unit in some localities that was a little bit larger than a dre [tib. བྲེ].">daso</a> [Tib. ཟླ་ཟོ] and sometimes they would give 2 daso and sometimes 3 daso. There were differences in the Rigdra.   

**Q:**  When did the Rigdra pay the grain salary?   

**A:**  They would pay it in the 7th lunar month.   

**Q:**  Was that at the time of the Opera Festival, <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཞོ་སྟོན] The &quot;Yogurt&quot; Festival held in Lhasa to celebrate the end of the monks&#x27; summer retreat in the middle of the 5th lunar month (usually August). It was a time when Tibetan operas were performed.">Shotön</a> [Tib. ཞོ་སྟོན]?   

**A:**  Just after finishing the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཞོ་སྟོན] The &quot;Yogurt&quot; Festival held in Lhasa to celebrate the end of the monks&#x27; summer retreat in the middle of the 5th lunar month (usually August). It was a time when Tibetan operas were performed.">Shotön</a>, the Rigdra would begin. They would also pay salt and soda [Tib. བུལ་ཏོག] measuring in <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. བྲེ] A unit of traditional volume measurement [a container] in Tibet, 20 of which typically equaled one khe or bo [also a container], although in some areas there were only 16 dre in one khe.">dre</a>. Sometimes they would pay 2 dre and sometimes 3 dre and sometimes they would pay 4 dre. So it was not same in every year. They have different names like the big Rigdra [Tib. ཆེ་ཁག] and the middle Rigdra [Tib. འབྲིང་ཁག] and the small Rigdra [Tib. ཆུང་ཁག].   

**Q:**  From the Rigdra, they would pay salt, soda and <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. རྩམ་པ] The traditional Tibetan staple food that consists of grain that is roasted (popped), usually in heated sand, and then ground into a flour.">tsamba</a>, right?   

**A:**  Yes, the Rigdra would serve tea in the tsog. But we didn't go to the tsog.   

**Q:**  They would pay the salary from outside of the main gate of the monastery, <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. སྒོ་མཆོར] The area outside of the monastic assembly hall that is supported by tall pillars.">gomchor</a> [Tib. སྒོ་མཆོར], right?   

**A:**  Yes, they would call this receiving the salary share, <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. སྐལ་ལེན] A special right allowing certain monks to take their share of alms outside of the prayer assembly hall. This privilege meant they did not have to attend the prayer session to get their alms.">kelen</a> [Tib. སྐལ་ལེན], but there was no different on the amount of the salary whether you join in <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཚོགས] 1. A prayer assembly meeting in monasteries when all the monks come to an assembly hall and chant prayers together. 2. An offering made of tsamba, butter and dry cheese in the shape of a cone.">tsog</a> or you get the salary share.   

**Q:**  When <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. སྒོ་མང] One of the large colleges in Drepung Monastery.">Gomang</a> Tratsang leased the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. གཞིས་ཀ] A manorial estate.">shiga</a>, the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. གྲྭ་ཚང] A &quot;college&quot; within a monastery, for example, in Drepung Monastery there were four main tratsang: Gomang, Loseling, Deyang and Ngagpa. These tratsang were property owning corporate entities and included monks who were organized into residential dormitories called Khamtsen.">tratsang</a> would get about 1,000 <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཁལ] A traditional volume measurement used for measuring grain in traditional Tibetan society. Sizes of this unit varied somewhat, but the official government khe (called mkhar ru or bstan dzin mkha ru) weighed about 28-31 pounds for barley. It was used to convey the size of fields. For example, a field said to be 10 khe in size meant that 10 khe of seed could be sown on that field.">khe</a> of grain for the lease, right?   

**A:**  Yes.   

**Q:**  There was a system where the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. གཞིས་ཀ] A manorial estate.">shiga</a> directly would give one <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཁལ] A traditional volume measurement used for measuring grain in traditional Tibetan society. Sizes of this unit varied somewhat, but the official government khe (called mkhar ru or bstan dzin mkha ru) weighed about 28-31 pounds for barley. It was used to convey the size of fields. For example, a field said to be 10 khe in size meant that 10 khe of seed could be sown on that field.">khe</a> of grain to each monk. Did you have this kind of system?   

**A:**  Our <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. སྒོ་མང] One of the large colleges in Drepung Monastery.">Gomang</a> Tratsang won't give the grain directly from the shiga.   

**Q:**  <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. བློ་གསལ་གླིང] One of the main colleges in Drepung Monastery.">Loseling</a> would supply grain to the monks from <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. གཞིས་ཀ] A manorial estate.">shiga</a> directly, right?   

**A:**  Yes, but for the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. སྒོ་མང] One of the large colleges in Drepung Monastery.">Gomang</a>, the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. གཞིས་ཀ] A manorial estate.">shiga</a> would deliver the grain to the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. གྲྭ་ཚང] A &quot;college&quot; within a monastery, for example, in Drepung Monastery there were four main tratsang: Gomang, Loseling, Deyang and Ngagpa. These tratsang were property owning corporate entities and included monks who were organized into residential dormitories called Khamtsen.">tratsang</a> and the tratsang would put them in the main granary in the tratsang. If there were left over grain, then they would give it to the monks.   

**Q:**  In which month <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. སྒོ་མང] One of the large colleges in Drepung Monastery.">Gomang</a> Tratsang would pay the three <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཁལ] A traditional volume measurement used for measuring grain in traditional Tibetan society.

For example, a field said to be 10 khe in size meant that 10 khe of seed could be sown on that field.">khe</a> of grain salary?   

**A:**  There was no fix time for that. To tell you the truth, they pay the grain salary when the number of monks were less. This is very bad.   

**Q:**  Who has the power to pay the salary?   

**A:**  The <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཕྱག་སྦུག] A manager (of estates and endowments) of a monastic college or monastic khamtsen.">chabu</a> has the power.   

**Q:**  The grain salary would be paid from the monastery or would they give a receipt for getting the grain [from the shiga]?   

**A:**  The <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. གཞིས་ཀ] A manorial estate.">shiga</a> manager would pay the lease or the storage grain, karjug [Tib. བཀར་འཇུག] to the granary in the monastery and the grain steward, <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. འབྲུ་གཉེར] A steward (nyerpa) in charge of grain.">drunyer</a> [Tib. འབྲུ་གཉེར] would pay the grain salary.   

**Q:**  When would the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. སྤྱི་བསོ] The head managers/stewards of monasteries as a whole, especially the large Gelugpa monasteries like Sera and Drepung.">jiso</a> pay the grain salary?   

**A:**  The salary from the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. སྤྱི་བསོ] The head managers/stewards of monasteries as a whole, especially the large Gelugpa monasteries like Sera and Drepung.">jiso</a> had a fix time, probably one is in spring and one is in autumn and the jiso won't wait for the number of the monks to become less.   

**Q:**  When you were young, you would get one <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཁལ] A traditional volume measurement used for measuring grain in traditional Tibetan society. Sizes of this unit varied somewhat, but the official government khe (called mkhar ru or bstan dzin mkha ru) weighed about 28-31 pounds for barley. It was used to convey the size of fields. For example, a field said to be 10 khe in size meant that 10 khe of seed could be sown on that field.">khe</a> of grain from the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. གྲྭ་ཚང] A &quot;college&quot; within a monastery, for example, in Drepung Monastery there were four main tratsang: Gomang, Loseling, Deyang and Ngagpa. These tratsang were property owning corporate entities and included monks who were organized into residential dormitories called Khamtsen.">tratsang</a> and two small bo of grain from the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. སྤྱི་བསོ] The head managers/stewards of monasteries as a whole, especially the large Gelugpa monasteries like Sera and Drepung.">jiso</a> and also little grain from the Rigdra, right?   

**A:**  Yes.   

**Q:**  Among the monks if they didn't have any source of livelihood and they have to depend only on the salary, were they able to manage their livelihood?   

**A:**  No, they weren't able to manage themselves. But, among the monks, some of them would go to manage the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. རྫོང] A district in the traditional Tibetan governmental structure. This large administrative unit was headed by one or two district heads (tib. dzongpön [རྫོང་དཔོན]) appointed by the Tibetan government. Typically there was one lay official and one monk official who were jointly sent from Lhasa for three year terms. They were responsible for collecting taxes and adjudicating disputes in their district. These dzong were equivalent to counties (ch. 县) in the current Chinese system of administration.">dzong</a> and shiga. Some of the monks would do big trade. Some of the monks would do the small business. Some of the monks would carry the load of merchandise from Lhasa to the countryside to sell them. There were also monks who carry loads from Lhasa to the monastery. That's how they find the living. In general, the monk's livelihood was very poor. For example, the income for the farmers is the yearly yield and the monk's income in a year is the Prayer Festival, Mönlam Chenmo [Tib. སྨོན་ལམ་ཆེན་མོ].
