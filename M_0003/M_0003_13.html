For example, Hamdong Khamtsen was part of Gomang College in Drepung Monastery.">khamtsen</span> and about the reception, but you didn&apos;t tell me in detail how did they make the tea.

For example, Hamdong Khamtsen was part of Gomang College in Drepung Monastery.">khamtsen</span>, they didn&apos;t churn the tea and the tea was black tea on which the butter was added in the cauldron and they would stir it and serve it. The senior monks who sit at the front of the row would get tea with grease and at the end of row, they won&apos;t get the grease. Namely, there were 8 laymen who would fetch water, chulen [Tib. &#xF46;&#xF74;&#xF0B;&#xF63;&#xF7A;&#xF53;] and one for making the fire, metonga [Tib. &#xF58;&#xF7A;&#xF0B;&#xF42;&#xF4F;&#xF7C;&#xF44;&#xF0B;&#xF56;].

<p><strong>Q:</strong>  They also have the responsibility for putting the right amount of water for the tea and the butter, right?   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  The water for the tea would be controlled by the <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. &#xF47;&#xF0B;&#xF58;] The monk(s) in charge of a monastery&apos;s kitchen.">jama</span>.

There was a rule when they served the tea in the assembly. Sometimes, they have to serve one cup of tea for each monk and sometimes 2-3 cups should be served. Usually, as for the thabyog, they would try to put some more water because if there were tea left over, the thabyog would carry them in buckets to Thamba to their homes. Therefore, when they were making the tea the jama has to control the amount of water because the thabyog might make a light tea for the assembly and take away a lot of left over. It would not be okay if the thabyog didn&apos;t get any left over tea to take home, because the thabyog didn&apos;t have any wages. They were obliged to fetch water as a tax.

<p><strong>Q:</strong>  How much grain salary did you get in a year?   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  In the past, when I just joined the monastery, there was only one <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. &#xF41;&#xF63;] A traditional volume measurement used for measuring grain in traditional Tibetan society. Sizes of this unit varied somewhat, but the official government khe (called mkhar ru or bstan dzin mkha ru) weighed about 28-31 pounds for barley. It was used to convey the size of fields. For example, a field said to be 10 khe in size meant that 10 khe of seed could be sown on that field.">khe</span> of grain. Later, it went up to two khe of grain. And before the revolt there were 4 khe of grain.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  When did they start paying 2 <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. &#xF41;&#xF63;] A traditional volume measurement used for measuring grain in traditional Tibetan society.

<p><strong>A:</strong>  I don&apos;t remember very well but I think it was 10 years ago.

For example, a field said to be 10 khe in size meant that 10 khe of seed could be sown on that field.">khe</span> of grain? Was that after the Chinese came or before that?   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  That was before Chinese came to Tibet. Since Chinese came monks, they didn&apos;t get the chance to increase the salary because, the Chinese won&apos;t think about the monk&apos;s salary.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  Just before the revolt, the ordinary monks filed a law case saying, there were many grain in the monastery and the grain should be given to the monks for the salary and also they need to audit the accounts. So they came to the Branch Judicial System where Civil Disputes are settled, Gy&#xF6;shib Lekhung [Tib. &#xF42;&#xFB1;&#xF7C;&#xF51;&#xF0B;&#xF5E;&#xF72;&#xF56;&#xF0B;&#xF63;&#xF66;&#xF0B;&#xF41;&#xF74;&#xF44;&#xF66;] to do the audit, was that right?   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  I am telling you the truth. The law case of the monks were not that certain. No matter how much grain they have in the store, they have to give the grain for the salary in every year. The <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. &#xF42;&#xFB2;&#xFAD;&#xF0B;&#xF5A;&#xF44;] A &quot;college&quot; within a monastery, for example, in Drepung Monastery there were four main tratsang: Gomang, Loseling, Deyang and Ngagpa.

There was a big house called granary which had two stories and they would fill it with grain in both stories. There was a hole in the second story and when the grain is finished they would take out the grain from the hole. The case was not only about that. There were also many matters beside that. The law case was based on the Nyen Shiga in T&#xF6;lung and we got that Shiga through the law case. I think this was about the difference between the <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. &#xF51;&#xF54;&#xF7A;&#xF0B;&#xF46;&#xF0B;&#xF56;] A monk studying the monastic philosophical curriculum. A scholar monk.">pechawa</span> and the lagy&#xFC;ba. I didn&apos;t know about the previous law case.

<p><strong>Q:</strong>  Was Gy&#xF6;shib set up just before the <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. &#xF66;&#xF92;&#xF7C;&#xF0B;&#xF58;&#xF44;] One of the large colleges in Drepung Monastery.">Gomang</span> Tratsang applied the law case?   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  Just, before we applied the law case, Gy&#xF6;shib Lekhung was set up. They did the audit for many days and the monks who were in charge of this matter, didn&apos;t have to face any trouble. The monks who filed the case didn&apos;t fully understand what was the real matter and they just talked recklessly. It would be difficult for the monks to talk deeply about the case. In the past, the <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. &#xF41;&#xF58;&#xF66;&#xF0B;&#xF54;] A person from the Kham region, a Tibetan from the Khampa (Khamba) sub-cultural group.">Khampa</span>, <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. &#xF68;&#xF0B;&#xF58;&#xF51;&#xF7C;] One of the three main Tibetan sub-ethnic areas.

There were two kinds of <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. &#xF51;&#xF42;&#xF7A;&#xF0B;&#xF66;&#xF90;&#xF7C;&#xF66;] The main disciplinary official in a monastic college (tratsang).">geg&#xF6;</span>; one is the winter geg&#xF6; and the other is the summer geg&#xF6;.

Therefore, the monks would have competition to become the candidate of the geg&#xF6;. Otherwise, unless the abbot insist the monks to the geg&#xF6;, they won&apos;t do it by themselves.   </p>

<p><strong>Q:</strong>  The <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. &#xF51;&#xF42;&#xF7A;&#xF0B;&#xF66;&#xF90;&#xF7C;&#xF66;] The main disciplinary official in a monastic college (tratsang).">geg&#xF6;</span> should pay the money for the <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. &#xF50;&#xF74;&#xF42;&#xF0B;&#xF54;] 1.

<p><strong>A:</strong>  It is okay to give the alms in addition to the replacement of the <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. &#xF50;&#xF74;&#xF42;&#xF0B;&#xF54;] 1.

<p><strong>Q:</strong>  How did they go for the candidate for the shengo?   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  If they would get the shengo&apos;s position that would be good. But if they didn&apos;t get it, they couldn&apos;t do anything.

<p><strong>A:</strong>  Yes, that was because 4 <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. &#xF42;&#xFB2;&#xFAD;&#xF0B;&#xF5A;&#xF44;] A &quot;college&quot; within a monastery, for example, in Drepung Monastery there were four main tratsang: Gomang, Loseling, Deyang and Ngagpa.

The assembly hall for the monastery as a whole.">tsogchen</span> has a little bit of grease, right?   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  Yes, only the <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. &#xF51;&#xF42;&#xF7A;&#xF0B;&#xF64;&#xF7A;&#xF66;] An advanced degree earned by scholar monks.">geshe</span> and senior monks would get a little bit grease and newly joint the monks won&apos;t get much grease in the tea. Anyhow, there were 6 people who were looking after the tea each morning.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  What kind of relationship did the branch monastery of <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. &#xF66;&#xF92;&#xF7C;&#xF0B;&#xF58;&#xF44;] One of the large colleges in Drepung Monastery.">Gomang</span> [Tib. &#xF42;&#xF5E;&#xF72;&#xF66;&#xF0B;&#xF51;&#xF42;&#xF7C;&#xF53;] have with the Gomang Tratsang? Some of them were saying that the abbots of the branch monastery would be appointed by the Gomang Tratsang. Some people were saying that the Branch Monastery would pay the tax to the Gomang Tratsang and the Gomang Tratsang wouldn&apos;t do any thing to the branch monastery, so what was the reality?   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. &#xF66;&#xF92;&#xF7C;&#xF0B;&#xF58;&#xF44;] One of the large colleges in Drepung Monastery.">Gomang</span> Tratsang had less branch monasteries comparing with other tratsang. In the past, there were Champaling [Tib. &#xF56;&#xFB1;&#xF58;&#xF66;&#xF0B;&#xF54;&#xF0B;&#xF42;&#xFB3;&#xF72;&#xF44;] Monastery in Lhoka area and there was a abbot in the monastery which belonged to Gomang Tratsang. Later, Labrang K&#xFC;ndeling [Tib. &#xF56;&#xFB3;&#xF0B;&#xF56;&#xFB2;&#xF44;&#xF0B;&#xF40;&#xF74;&#xF53;&#xF0B;&#xF56;&#xF51;&#xF7A;&#xF0B;&#xF42;&#xFB3;&#xF72;&#xF44;] kept the monastery.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  Labrang K&#xFC;ndeling took the Shiga as lease and they also kept the monastery, right?   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  Yes, therefore in the past, as you said that there were law case and the case was about the Champaling Monastery. They increased the salary of the monks. Before that, they just had about 2-3 yuan.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  How did they increase the salary? Did they increase the salary since they got the <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. &#xF42;&#xF5E;&#xF72;&#xF66;&#xF0B;&#xF40;] A manorial estate.">shiga</span> or how did they do it?   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  They kept the <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. &#xF42;&#xF5E;&#xF72;&#xF66;&#xF0B;&#xF40;] A manorial estate.">shiga</span> and they increased the lease and they paid a special salary.

The <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. &#xF42;&#xFB2;&#xFAD;&#xF0B;&#xF5A;&#xF44;] A &quot;college&quot; within a monastery, for example, in Drepung Monastery there were four main tratsang: Gomang, Loseling, Deyang and Ngagpa.

When they come back, it was really helpful to the Gomang tratsang.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  You mean to say on income right?   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  Yes.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  There were many <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. &#xF42;&#xFB2;&#xFAD;&#xF0B;&#xF62;&#xF92;&#xFB1;&#xF74;&#xF53;] Monks who came to Drepung, Ganden and Sera from far distances such as Kham and Amdo.">tragy&#xFC;n</span> who came from the monasteries in the long distance, from <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. &#xF68;&#xF0B;&#xF58;&#xF51;&#xF7C;] One of the three main Tibetan sub-ethnic areas.

<p><strong>A:</strong>  Yes, they were kind of belonged to the tratsang.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  So what kind of relationship did they have between the branch monastery and the main monastery?   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  I don&apos;t know about that. There were many well known and holy <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. &#xF68;&#xF0B;&#xF58;&#xF51;&#xF7C;] One of the three main Tibetan sub-ethnic areas. It is located in the northeast of the Tibetan Plateau mostly in today&apos;s Qinghai Province.

But they didn&apos;t have any sources [like monastery]. There was a monastery in Kongpo [Tib. &#xF40;&#xF7C;&#xF44;&#xF0B;&#xF54;&#xF7C;] called Tashi Rabten [Tib. &#xF56;&#xF40;&#xFB2;&#xF0B;&#xF56;&#xF64;&#xF72;&#xF66;&#xF0B;&#xF62;&#xF56;&#xF0B;&#xF56;&#xF62;&#xF9F;&#xF53;] which was a small monastery. The monastery had little miser. From Drepung Monastery, they would send a monk called Tashi Rabten Depa [Tib. &#xF66;&#xFA1;&#xF7A;&#xF0B;&#xF54;] to that monastery. The Deba would stay in Tashi Rabten for few years and when he would come back he would offer little amount of butter as the income he got from the animals. There wasn&apos;t any fix income from Amdo which is written in the books.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  There were Branch Monasteries in <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. &#xF68;&#xF0B;&#xF58;&#xF51;&#xF7C;] One of the three main Tibetan sub-ethnic areas. It is located in the northeast of the Tibetan Plateau mostly in today&apos;s Qinghai Province.

<p><strong>A:</strong>  Yes, there were branch monasteries.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  So we know that there wasn&apos;t any financial relation between the branch monastery and the <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. &#xF66;&#xF92;&#xF7C;&#xF0B;&#xF58;&#xF44;] One of the large colleges in Drepung Monastery.">Gomang</span> Tratsang. The monks would come to Gomang Tratsang and they would say that our monastery was the branch monastery of the Gomang Tratsang. So what was the reason to become the branch monastery of the Gomang Tratsang?   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  Probably, this was because the branch monasteries were belonged to <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. &#xF66;&#xF92;&#xF7C;&#xF0B;&#xF58;&#xF44;] One of the large colleges in Drepung Monastery.">Gomang</span> Tratsang from the ancient times [Tib. &#xF50;&#xF7C;&#xF56;&#xF0B;&#xF41;&#xF74;&#xF44;&#xF66;].

In Lhasa there were the houses called Eastern Jayang, Jayang Shar [Tib. &#xF60;&#xF47;&#xF58;&#xF0B;&#xF51;&#xF56;&#xFB1;&#xF44;&#xF0B;&#xF64;&#xF62;] and Midddle Jayang, Jayang kyil [Tib. &#xF60;&#xF47;&#xF58;&#xF0B;&#xF51;&#xF56;&#xFB1;&#xF44;&#xF0B;&#xF66;&#xF90;&#xFB1;&#xF72;&#xF63; ] and Western Jayang, Jayang Nub [Tib. &#xF60;&#xF47;&#xF58;&#xF0B;&#xF51;&#xF56;&#xFB1;&#xF44;&#xF0B;&#xF53;&#xF74;&#xF56;]. Jamyang Shepa offered all of these houses to the Gomang Tratsang and he also offered an Shiga in Kyarbo which could produce 1,000 <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. &#xF41;&#xF63;] A traditional volume measurement used for measuring grain in traditional Tibetan society. Sizes of this unit varied somewhat, but the official government khe (called mkhar ru or bstan dzin mkha ru) weighed about 28-31 pounds for barley. It was used to convey the size of fields.

Beside that, there wasn&apos;t anything that the Amdo offered to the tratsang.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  When did they begin the belonging system, Thobkhung?   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  I think that began in the early times of the Jekumbum [Tib. &#xF62;&#xF97;&#xF7A;&#xF0B;&#xF66;&#xF90;&#xF74;&#xF0B;&#xF60;&#xF56;&#xF74;&#xF58;] which was found by the Lama Tsongkhapa [Tib. &#xF59;&#xF7C;&#xF44;&#xF0B;&#xF41;&#xF0B;&#xF54;].

<p><strong>Q:</strong>  Wow! When did he offer that? Was it recently?   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  It was just few years ago. That was at the time when Panchen Lama passed away. There was one <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. &#xF68;&#xF0B;&#xF58;&#xF51;&#xF7C;] One of the three main Tibetan sub-ethnic areas.

The main birth place of Gungthang Rinpoche is in Tselgung Thang [Tib. &#xF5A;&#xF63;&#xF0B;&#xF42;&#xF74;&#xF44;&#xF0B;&#xF50;&#xF44;] [located at the east side of Lhasa]. He asked the people whether they could build the monastery in Tshelgung Thang or not. The people said they can&apos;t build the monastery. He told them that if you can build a monastery, I would help you. But, they were unable to build the monastery. And he asked them, &quot;do you know what was my birth household?&quot; They said they don&apos;t know. He was born in Tselgungthang. When Gungthang Rinpoche went to pilgrimage to Ganden he gave 1,000 <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. &#xF41;&#xF63;] A traditional volume measurement used for measuring grain in traditional Tibetan society.

For example, a field said to be 10 khe in size meant that 10 khe of seed could be sown on that field.">khe</span> of butter to the people who were living near the Ganden because there were poor. He said. &quot;you people should divide the butter to all the people in the village equally regardless of age.&quot; When he came for the pilgrimage to <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. &#xF66;&#xF92;&#xF7C;&#xF0B;&#xF58;&#xF44;] One of the large colleges in Drepung Monastery.">Gomang</span> Tratsang, he saw that <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. &#xF42;&#xFB2;&#xFAD;&#xF0B;&#xF5A;&#xF44;] A &quot;college&quot; within a monastery, for example, in Drepung Monastery there were four main tratsang: Gomang, Loseling, Deyang and Ngagpa.

So he told them to make the mattress and Gomang Tratsang made the mattress with felt covered with fine woolen material Shema [Tib. &#xF64;&#xF51;&#xF0B;&#xF58;] which is best quality woolen cloth. This was offered by the Amdo Lama Gungthang Tenpe Dr&#xF6;nme.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  Nowadays, how many monks are there in Sera?   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  There are over 400 monks who were regularly admitted.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  So that was as same as Drepung?   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  Yes, it is same as Drepung. Most of the monks didn&apos;t have residence permit [Tib. &#xF50;&#xF7A;&#xF58;&#xF0B;&#xF50;&#xF7C;]. There were 300-400 monks were yet to be admitted. There were many young monks who had already memorized <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. &#xF51;&#xF54;&#xF7A;&#xF0B;&#xF46;] Religious books/texts, scriptures.">pecha</span>, but yet to be admitted. Last time, the government&apos;s Work Team [Tib. &#xF63;&#xF66;&#xF0B;&#xF51;&#xF7C;&#xF53;&#xF0B;&#xF62;&#xF74;&#xF0B;&#xF41;&#xF42;] came to the monastery and said, &quot;there is no discipline in the monastery and we would make the discipline and we would admit new monks but not too many. We have to report to the superior&quot; They made a great deal on saying that. They said a lot about admitting monks to the monastery but they didn&apos;t admit a single monk. After that, the talk about admitting the monks is becoming more and more distant.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  What was the procedures for getting admitted in the <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. &#xF46;&#xF7C;&#xF66;&#xF0B;&#xF62;] The special grove (&quot;dharma grove&quot;) in monasteries where monks formally met to practice debating.">ch&#xF6;ra</span> in Sera? In Drepung, if I say I want to get admitted in the ch&#xF6;ra, it was not so easy. How about over here?   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  Here, you would get admitted. In Sera it is a good place to learn the <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. &#xF58;&#xF5A;&#xF53;&#xF0B;&#xF49;&#xF72;&#xF51;] Buddhist dialectics. This is taught after the six-year curriculum called d&#xFC;dra.">tsenyi</span> and when you got admitted, the <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. &#xF51;&#xF42;&#xF7A;&#xF0B;&#xF62;&#xF92;&#xF53;] 1. Teacher in a school. 2. In monastic settings it also refers to an adult monk who acted as a guardian to a younger monk. In such cases, the younger monk typically lived in the gegen&apos;s apartment (shag). In monasteries, however, it could also mean a real teacher, or the monk who served as the guarantor for a new monk.">gegen</span> would tell you that you should learn the tsenyi. But some of the young monks didn&apos;t behave well and wandered around. There was the Tantric ritual [Tib. &#xF66;&#xF94;&#xF42;&#xF66;&#xF0B;&#xF46;&#xF7C;&#xF42;] which need to be memorized. The monks who were memorizing the Tantric ritual do not need to learn tsenyi. In Tibetan Buddhism is divided in two part one is Sutra [Tib. &#xF58;&#xF51;&#xF7C;] which is tsenyi and the other is Tantra. So you can chose whatever you want to learn. If you didn&apos;t know the tsenyi then you can tell the leader [Tib. &#xF60;&#xF42;&#xF7C;&#xF0B;&#xF41;&#xFB2;&#xF72;&#xF51;] that I want to learn the tantric ritual, they would agree with that.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  You have to join the <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. &#xF46;&#xF7C;&#xF66;&#xF0B;&#xF62;] The special grove (&quot;dharma grove&quot;) in monasteries where monks formally met to practice debating.">ch&#xF6;ra</span> right?   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  If you got admitted you can join the <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. &#xF46;&#xF7C;&#xF66;&#xF0B;&#xF62;] The special grove (&quot;dharma grove&quot;) in monasteries where monks formally met to practice debating.">ch&#xF6;ra</span>. Nowadays, even if you didn&apos;t get admitted in the ch&#xF6;ra and if you want to debate on <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. &#xF58;&#xF5A;&#xF53;&#xF0B;&#xF49;&#xF72;&#xF51;] Buddhist dialectics. This is taught after the six-year curriculum called d&#xFC;dra.">tsenyi</span>, then you can tell the monastic official that I want to join the ch&#xF6;ra and they would let you join it. The monks who join the ch&#xF6;ra would get little bit wages according to the number of days they joined the ch&#xF6;ra. The wages was not high it was just like almost little less than one <span class="tooltip" data-text="[ch. &#x5143;] China&apos;s basic currency unit. A yuan is divided into 100 fen and 10 jiao. It is also known as renminbi or &quot;people&apos;s currency.&quot;">yuan</span> or few fens. They would make notes everyday for the monks who came to the ch&#xF6;ra. In the evening, when you go to receive the teaching from your <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. &#xF51;&#xF42;&#xF7A;&#xF0B;&#xF62;&#xF92;&#xF53;] 1. Teacher in a school. 2. In monastic settings it also refers to an adult monk who acted as a guardian to a younger monk. In such cases, the younger monk typically lived in the gegen&apos;s apartment (shag). In monasteries, however, it could also mean a real teacher, or the monk who served as the guarantor for a new monk.">gegen</span>, they would make the note. And they would pay the wages according to the note. If you don&apos;t have residential card, then you wouldn&apos;t get the wages even though you joined the ch&#xF6;ra.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  To get the wages, do the monks have to be regularly admitted or do they have to have the residence permit?   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  If they didn&apos;t have the residence permit to show that they were nomarly admitted, then they would become very poor. There is a very strange system in Sera, if you go to the <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. &#xF46;&#xF7C;&#xF66;&#xF0B;&#xF62;] The special grove (&quot;dharma grove&quot;) in monasteries where monks formally met to practice debating.">ch&#xF6;ra</span> or to receive teaching, they would differentiate the monks who have residence permit or not. Actually, they should treat them equally whether they have residence permit or not because the monks who didn&apos;t have residence permit are also studying the tsenyis. During the daytime, there are many monks who go to work and the wages would be paid according to the residence permit.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  The monks who have residence permit would get more wages?   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  Yes, that is very bad. The residence permit is to get the ration grain. The monks who have residence permit and the monks who didn&apos;t have residential when they go to work they would go together they would get off from the work at the same time. But, the monks who didn&apos;t have the resident card here would suffer a great loss when they differentiate the monks who have residence permit and who have not. We don&apos;t know what is the aim of the leader. We have the resident card, but I don&apos;t have a job.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  You are belonged to the Nursing Home [Tib. &#xF62;&#xF92;&#xF66;&#xF0B;&#xF42;&#xF66;&#xF7C;&#xF0B;&#xF41;&#xF44;] right?   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  Yes.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  Nowadays, in Drepung they set up a new school and is there any hope that the system of the school would be as same as Sera?   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  Yes, there is the hope for that. They decided to set up a school. They were saying that they are going to admit new monks and they would give them resident card and they also said they would give the resident card to those who didn&apos;t have one. They said like that, but they didn&apos;t do it yet.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  Who promised that? Was it the Democratic Mangement Committee [Tib. &#xF68;&#xF74;&#xF0B;&#xF61;&#xF7C;&#xF53;&#xF0B;&#xF63;&#xFB7;&#xF53;&#xF0B;&#xF41;&#xF44;] or the Work Team?   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  The Democratic Mangement Committee and Work team discussed together but the Work Team has the main power. Except 300-400 children got admitted, rest of them were all registered. The Work Team already made the registration and they said, &quot;we are going to set up the school and any one can join the school. If you learn some thing it would help you in the future. If you don&apos;t want to come to school no one would call you to the school.&quot;   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  Did they start the school?   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  Not yet. The Work Team said they are going to make many classes. In Drepung, they would teach <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. &#xF51;&#xF54;&#xF7A;&#xF0B;&#xF46;] Religious books/texts, scriptures.">pecha</span> in the morning and in the afternoon they would let them learn Tibetan writing and reading. I think in Sera, they are going to make classes like Tibetan, Chinese, English and tsenyi. They said they are going to make strict discipline and if you do well, then you would fulfill your parents and <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. &#xF51;&#xF42;&#xF7A;&#xF0B;&#xF62;&#xF92;&#xF53;] 1. Teacher in a school. 2. In monastic settings it also refers to an adult monk who acted as a guardian to a younger monk. In such cases, the younger monk typically lived in the gegen&apos;s apartment (shag). In monasteries, however, it could also mean a real teacher, or the monk who served as the guarantor for a new monk.">gegen</span>&apos;s wishes and in the future you would be happy. Otherwise, if you just say that you want to be monk in the monastery and if you didn&apos;t study pecha or learn skill, it won&apos;t help you. They started registering ten days ago.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  In Drepung, the Work Team came and registered the young monks and they got admitted in school. The Work Team said it is not allowed to admit more new monks, is that right?   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  Yes, that&apos;s right.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  Did they say the same thing in sera?   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  At the beginning, they said like that. Now we don&apos;t know because they hadn&apos;t summerize [Tib. &#xF66;&#xFA1;&#xF7C;&#xF58;&#xF0B;&#xF62;&#xF92;&#xFB1;&#xF42;] the number of students in the school. They will count how many students joined the school and then summerize it. They said the monk who didn&apos;t come to school or the monks who didn&apos;t get admitted in the monastery were not allowed to stay in the monastery. If they didn&apos;t get admitted in monastery then they can join the school. This is right, we really need discipline in the monastery.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  Do the monks need to pay the rent?   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  No, all the monks didn&apos;t need to pay the rant.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  If you get retired, do you need to pay the rant?   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  Yes, I think you have to pay a little. There were not many retired monks.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  For example, the monk who is not retired and he didn&apos;t get admitted in monastery and used to be monk and stay in Sera Monastery, did those monks need to pay the rent?   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  They were considered as retired. Anyhow, the monks who didn&apos;t belong to Sera, but if they just stayed in Sera, they would be considered as retired. I think they need to pay the rent. I am not so sure. If they have to pay the rent, it is not high.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  Did the Work Team ask you about monks opinion, right?   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  Yes.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  So what did the monks say?   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  It is hard for the monks to tell their real opinion. Some of the monks said, &quot;in the past, there were many monks, but not now. So please let the monks join the monastery and give them the resident card. If they don&apos;t have the residence permit, it is hard for them to find the living. If they don&apos;t find the living, it is hard for them to practice Dharma [Tib. &#xF46;&#xF7C;&#xF66;].&quot; Some of them were saying, &quot;the monks didn&apos;t have good discipline and going to Lhasa and wearing pants and riding bicycle and the discipline is getting worse.&quot;   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  Did the Democratic Mangement Committee have the power?   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  No, the Work Team had the power.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  When the monks were wearing laymen clothe and going every where in Lhasa, did the Democratic Mangement Committee have the power to stop them?   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  They were talking about that everyday. There are also <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. &#xF51;&#xF42;&#xF7A;&#xF0B;&#xF66;&#xF90;&#xF7C;&#xF66;] The main disciplinary official in a monastic college (tratsang).">geg&#xF6;</span> and he was saying that monks were not allowed to ride the bicycle and not allowed to go out to Lhasa. The monks were not allowed to go out late night and not allowed to drink <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. 1. &#xF46;&#xF44;, 2. &#xF56;&#xFB1;&#xF44;] 1. Tibetan locally brewed barley beer. 2. North; nomad areas north of Lhasa in Nagchuga Prefecture 3. ch. &#x5382; factory.">chang</span>, smoke cigarette. But, those things were still happening like that.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  Were there any way to stop them?   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  That was because they couldn&apos;t make the discipline strict enough. It was not as same as in the past.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  If the monks were wearing laymen clothe and going to Lhasa with out getting permission, what if the monk got fired from association Kyidug [Tib. &#xF66;&#xF90;&#xFB1;&#xF72;&#xF51;&#xF0B;&#xF66;&#xFA1;&#xF74;&#xF42;]?   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  It is okay to fire the monks. The Democratic Mangement Committee and Work Team would scold the <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. &#xF51;&#xF42;&#xF7A;&#xF0B;&#xF62;&#xF92;&#xF53;] 1. Teacher in a school. 2. In monastic settings it also refers to an adult monk who acted as a guardian to a younger monk. In such cases, the younger monk typically lived in the gegen&apos;s apartment (shag). In monasteries, however, it could also mean a real teacher, or the monk who served as the guarantor for a new monk.">gegen</span> very much saying, &quot;you people have many <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. &#xF51;&#xF42;&#xF7A;&#xF0B;&#xF55;&#xFB2;&#xF74;&#xF42;] 1. Student. 2. Disciple. 3. Commonly the name for monks living with a gegen or teacher. These are more like wards than real disciples.">gidru</span> whether your parents told you to keep them or your relatives told you to keep them, or you kept the gidru because you are getting many things to eat. Anyway, why didn&apos;t you control your gidru. When you keep your gidru you have to know how to control the gidru. Some of the gegens didn&apos;t even know where the students have been. If you gegen didn&apos;t control the gidru then the Work Team and Democratic Mangement Committee would call you.&quot; These things happened because in general, they didn&apos;t have good discipline. In the past, at the time of 9200 monks in Sera Jei and Sera Mai [Tib. &#xF56;&#xFB1;&#xF7A;&#xF66;&#xF0B;&#xF66;&#xFA8;&#xF51;], all the monks were under the Tsogchen Shengo.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  In the past, they could whip them right?   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  In the past I swear they would decide the things by beating them up with switches.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  Nowadays, is it not allowed to beat the monks with switches?   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  No, it is not allowed to. And not allowed to fine them. In the past, they would fine them and they would beat them in the assembly and they make the person lay down and beat them with switches. Anyhow, in the past all the monks were controlled under two people. [the shengo] Nowadays there is no discipline. So they couldn&apos;t control the monks. If all the leaders [Tib. &#xF60;&#xF42;&#xF7C;&#xF0B;&#xF41;&#xFB2;&#xF72;&#xF51;] have solidarity and steadfast that would be good but sometimes they were like that and sometime were not like that. The members of the Democratic Mangement Committee are monks and the director [Ch. zhu ren] is a lay man. They would discuss all the matters when they met together. The director is the most powerful one.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  Nowadays, who is the most powerful one?   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  The <span class="tooltip" data-text="[ch. &#x4E3B;&#x4EFB;] Director of a unit or office.">zhuren</span> is most powerful who is a lay man.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  Is that the lame person?   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  Yes.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  Did Drepung have the same opinion?   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  In Drepung, they already set up the school and the student were studying <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. &#xF58;&#xF5A;&#xF53;&#xF0B;&#xF49;&#xF72;&#xF51;] Buddhist dialectics. This is taught after the six-year curriculum called d&#xFC;dra.">tsenyi</span> and writing and reading. The student were not allowed to go to school wearing laymen clothes. You have to wear the monks robe. That is the best. If they didn&apos;t allow to happen these things in the monastery, then they won&apos;t go every where. All of the monks were not like that. Just a few monks were not good. Most of the monks were good and they were studying <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. &#xF51;&#xF54;&#xF7A;&#xF0B;&#xF46;] Religious books/texts, scriptures.">pecha</span> really hard. The monks who go to work they would work hard. Nowadays in the park there are 20 monks working in the park. They told the monks who were working in the park, &quot;if you work hard in the park, later even if couldn&apos;t pass the exam, we would let you in the monastery.&quot; But no one knows what would the Work Team say in the future. You have to memorize 300 pages of pecha and take the test in order to get admitted. Last year and in the year before last year, even when they couldn&apos;t memorize 3-4 pages, they returned them back.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  Some of the monks in Drepung have the opinion that the <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. &#xF51;&#xF42;&#xF7A;&#xF0B;&#xF62;&#xF92;&#xF53;] 1. Teacher in a school. 2. In monastic settings it also refers to an adult monk who acted as a guardian to a younger monk. In such cases, the younger monk typically lived in the gegen&apos;s apartment (shag).

Student. 2. Disciple. 3. Commonly the name for monks living with a gegen or teacher. These are more like wards than real disciples.">gidru</span> in the <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. &#xF46;&#xF7C;&#xF66;&#xF0B;&#xF62;] The special grove (&quot;dharma grove&quot;) in monasteries where monks formally met to practice debating.">ch&#xF6;ra</span> and learned pecha. When they became 15-16 years old, they went to join the demonstration to shout slogan in Lhasa. So some of them got arrested and some of them escaped to India. So the gegen kept some new gidru and they would study and later they also joined the demonstration. Therefore, the gegen were disheartened. Is there the same situation here?   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  Yes, it is something like that.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  All the <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. &#xF51;&#xF54;&#xF7A;&#xF0B;&#xF46;&#xF0B;&#xF56;] A monk studying the monastic philosophical curriculum. A scholar monk.">pechawa</span> went to join the demonstration, right?   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  Few of them went. Depung had more pechawa.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  I was told that the monks who join the demonstration were best <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. &#xF51;&#xF54;&#xF7A;&#xF0B;&#xF46;&#xF0B;&#xF56;] A monk studying the monastic philosophical curriculum. A scholar monk.">pechawa</span>, right?   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  Yes, they were good in <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. &#xF51;&#xF54;&#xF7A;&#xF0B;&#xF46;] Religious books/texts, scriptures.">pecha</span> and chanting prayers. [Tib. &#xF60;&#xF51;&#xF7C;&#xF53;&#xF0B;&#xF46;]. At the beginning of the demonstration many monks from Sera jointed it. Last year, and in this year there were not many monks from Sera who joined the demonstration. Even now, there are quite a lot of monks in the jail. The Work Team came and they were mainly talking to the <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. &#xF51;&#xF42;&#xF7A;&#xF0B;&#xF62;&#xF92;&#xF53;] 1. Teacher in a school. 2. In monastic settings it also refers to an adult monk who acted as a guardian to a younger monk. In such cases, the younger monk typically lived in the gegen&apos;s apartment (shag). In monasteries, however, it could also mean a real teacher, or the monk who served as the guarantor for a new monk.">gegen</span> and they told the monks not to joint the disturbances. This is the principle.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  Did most of the <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. &#xF51;&#xF42;&#xF7A;&#xF0B;&#xF62;&#xF92;&#xF53;] 1. Teacher in a school. 2. In monastic settings it also refers to an adult monk who acted as a guardian to a younger monk. In such cases, the younger monk typically lived in the gegen&apos;s apartment (shag).

Student. 2. Disciple. 3. Commonly the name for monks living with a gegen or teacher. These are more like wards than real disciples.">gidru</span> that it is good to joint the demonstration?   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  I don&apos;t think the <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. &#xF51;&#xF42;&#xF7A;&#xF0B;&#xF62;&#xF92;&#xF53;] 1. Teacher in a school. 2. In monastic settings it also refers to an adult monk who acted as a guardian to a younger monk. In such cases, the younger monk typically lived in the gegen&apos;s apartment (shag).

Student. 2. Disciple. 3. Commonly the name for monks living with a gegen or teacher. These are more like wards than real disciples.">gidru</span> that it is good to join the demonstration even though some of them might have been thinking that it is good to join the demonstration. Nowadays, the reason why they think it is better not to join the demonstration, is because in the jail they would get seriously beaten and they would get beaten until they are almost dead. Therefore, the monks were thinking that it is not worthy to join the demonstration.   </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong>  Did the Work Team say that if the monks didn&apos;t join the demonstration, then they would get more new monks admitted and they would spend more expense?   </p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>  The Work Team was saying something like that. They didn&apos;t say that say if you don&apos;t join the demonstration, they would have the monks admitted. They just said, &quot;it is useless for the monks to join the demonstration. In the old society, Sera and the <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. &#xF66;&#xFA1;&#xF7A;&#xF0B;&#xF56;&#xF0B;&#xF42;&#xF5E;&#xF74;&#xF44;] The name of the traditional Tibetan government.">dewashung</span> had a war. At that time, monks of Sera didn&apos;t stay still, although the dewashung didn&apos;t have the power, but they destroyed the Sera Monastery and many people died and many of them were fired from monastery. Don&apos;t you people know about that? If you didn&apos;t know about the situation between dewashung and Sera, now the Chinese Government is very powerful, so you cannot raise your hands and over throw it.&quot; Actually, the meaning is different, but they are talking like that because they have the power. If we get the independent, we are not saying that we want the whole China. We are not saying that we want to overthrow China. If we gain the independence, it would be beneficial for the Buddhism and also for all sentient beings. More over, we could invite the Dalai Lama [back to Tibet].   </p>
