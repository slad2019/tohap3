**A:**  When someone asks for delay and adds the remaining loan on the old loan, domthag chö [Tib. བསྡོམ་ཐག་ཆོད], we three grain <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. གཉེར་པ] A steward or manager. In some monasteries, the nyerpa was in charge of storerooms under the authority of a higher manager called a chandzö.">nyerpa</a>, <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. འབྲུ་གཉེར] A steward (nyerpa) in charge of grain.">drunyer</a> [Tib. འབྲུ་གཉེར] have to discuss and the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. མི་སེར] A term that can mean serf/bound subject as well as citizen, depending on context. For example, the miser of a lord would connote the bound subjects of that lord, whereas the miser of Tibet would connote citizens of Tibet.">miser</a> gives something when they ask for this. We decide it on the spot. Another way to get something is when people ask for loans. When they give loans, the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཕྱག་སྦུག] A manager (of estates and endowments) of a monastic college or monastic khamtsen.">chabu</a> sits on the cushion and the clerk is also there, but some bigger households also give something to the drunyer for asking more loans, but as much as they give when asking for domthag chö. This is because we can influence how much of a loan should be given, so we get something then. Though chabu has a higher position and power, but really they don't stay there all the time and they don't know much and they depend on the strategy [Tib. ཇུས] and introducing people by the drunyer and chabu would have to depend on what the drunyer said because the drunyer is familiar with those debtors.   

**Q:**  How was it decided what amount goes for the salary to the monastery?   

**A:**  The <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. འབྲུ་གཉེར] A steward (nyerpa) in charge of grain.">drunyer</a> had his grain storage and the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཕྱག་སྦུག] A manager (of estates and endowments) of a monastic college or monastic khamtsen.">chabu</a> had many grain storage called ganjug [Tib. dkar bjug]. After the drunyer gave the loans, we store the remaining grain to the ganjug where they had the list on the pillar in which it was written the in put list [Tib. བཅུག་ཁྲ] and the out put list of the grain [Tib. བཏོན་ཁྲ]. When they send grain from the ganjug to the monastery, they make a out put list.   

**Q:**  What happedned if they give out all the grain for the loans? Would the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཕྱག་སྦུག] A manager (of estates and endowments) of a monastic college or monastic khamtsen.">chabu</a> say that it is not okay?   

**A:**  If there is no remaining which is caused by the bad crop or something, then there is nothing to do with it and the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཕྱག་སྦུག] A manager (of estates and endowments) of a monastic college or monastic khamtsen.">chabu</a> wouldn't say anything.   

**Q:**  Did this happen when you were the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. འབྲུ་གཉེར] A steward (nyerpa) in charge of grain.">drunyer</a>?   

**A:**  Only in one year, it happened when we gave loans of beans. If we still had remaining after lending out in spring and stored in the ganjug, sometimes we lend out <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. རྩམ་པ] The traditional Tibetan staple food that consists of grain that is roasted (popped), usually in heated sand, and then ground into a flour.">tsamba</a> in summer, yartsam [Tib. དབྱར་རྩམ]. We grind the grain into tsamba and lend it out in summer. Only the bigger granary have that.   

**Q:**  Does the amount of grain increase yearly because you get the yearly interest?   

**A:**  Yes, the principal increase on paper, but not on the grain in hand. Most is old loans getting bigger, but not in the actual collection or grain in hand. The Khashag's new edict was issued in the Water Horse Year [Tib. ཆུ་རྟ་ལོ] and they made the loan payment arrangement, gyeje [Tib. རྒྱས་དཔྱད].   

**Q:**  Wasn't this after the Chinese arrival?   

**A:**  Yes. At this time, it was said that <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. སྒོ་མང] One of the large colleges in Drepung Monastery.">Gomang</a>'s total amount of grain loan written on the paper reached about 93,000 <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཁལ] A traditional volume measurement used for measuring grain in traditional Tibetan society. Sizes of this unit varied somewhat, but the official government khe (called mkhar ru or bstan dzin mkha ru) weighed about 28-31 pounds for barley. It was used to convey the size of fields. For example, a field said to be 10 khe in size meant that 10 khe of seed could be sown on that field.">khe</a> including the amount they did the gyeje and the amount yet to be done the gyeje. Had the edict not issued for one year, it would have reach upto, 100,000 khe.   

**Q:**  How much principal and interest do you collect in a year from the places including Phenpo etc?   

**A:**  This I can't calculate. We don't really calculate. The <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. འབྲུ་གཉེར] A steward (nyerpa) in charge of grain.">drunyer</a> counts only the amount of grain in hand and the documents were kept by the tratsang. And the remaining grain in the granary was stored in the ganjug and they also give loans outside and use the remaining for the summer tsampa.   

**Q:**  The grain in the ganjug is mainly used for the monastery need, right?   

**A:**  The <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. འབྲུ་གཉེར] A steward (nyerpa) in charge of grain.">drunyer</a> stores them in the ganjug and from the ganjug they bring it to the monastery.   

**Q:**  The grain from the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. གཞིས་ཀ] A manorial estate.">shiga</a> was also stored in the ganjug, right?   

**A:**  Yes, it was stored in the same house, but the account is separate. I did the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. འབྲུ་གཉེར] A steward (nyerpa) in charge of grain.">drunyer</a> for the longest period among about 20 drunyer of the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. སྒོ་མང] One of the large colleges in Drepung Monastery.">Gomang</a> Tratsang.   

**Q:**  Do yo have any law cases caused by not paying the loans while you were <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. འབྲུ་གཉེར] A steward (nyerpa) in charge of grain.">drunyer</a>?   

**A:**  There might have been a little bit law cases.   

**Q:**  Was there any serious ones like the trouble in Phündrub [Tib. ལྷུན་གྲུབ] Dzong?   

**A:**  No. Nothing serious.   

**Q:**  Were you the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. འབྲུ་གཉེར] A steward (nyerpa) in charge of grain.">drunyer</a> while you were <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཇ་མ] The monk(s) in charge of a monastery&#x27;s kitchen.">jama</a>?   

**A:**  Yes for one year it overlapped and I did the both; <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. འབྲུ་གཉེར] A steward (nyerpa) in charge of grain.">drunyer</a> and the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཁང་ཚན] A monastic residential unit in which monks from specific geographic areas lived. These were corporate entities with property and internal officials. Some large khamtsen had smaller subordinate units called mi tshan. Khamtsen were part of tratsang (colleges). For example, Hamdong Khamtsen was part of Gomang College in Drepung Monastery.">khamtsen</a> jama. I did the drunyer for many years. I started drunyer after I finished <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. གྲྭ་ཚང] A &quot;college&quot; within a monastery, for example, in Drepung Monastery there were four main tratsang: Gomang, Loseling, Deyang and Ngagpa. These tratsang were property owning corporate entities and included monks who were organized into residential dormitories called Khamtsen.">tratsang</a> chayog [Tib. ཇ་གཡོག].   

**Q:**  What happens if a <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. མི་སེར] A term that can mean serf/bound subject as well as citizen, depending on context. For example, the miser of a lord would connote the bound subjects of that lord, whereas the miser of Tibet would connote citizens of Tibet.">miser</a> doesn't pay the loan? Do you have the power to beat them up or shut them in?   

**A:**  We had a little bit power to enforce because we were the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. འབྲུ་གཉེར] A steward (nyerpa) in charge of grain.">drunyer</a> of a big tratsang. We were doing this to support the monks like the saying, "use the root as the capital and use the leaves for the offering" [Tib. རྩ་བས་རྩ་བྱས། ལོ་མས་མཆོད་པ་འབུལ]. So if someone isn't paying the loans, we have the power to beat them. We can't beat for small loans. If we beat them, then that is considered punishment and they don't have to pay the loan [Tib. ཉེས་དག].   

**Q:**  Do you whip them or beat them with hand or stick without bleeding, kamdung [Tib. སྐམ་རྡུང]?   

**A:**  We were allowed to whip them or just beat them with hand or stick.   

**Q:**  Were you allowed to beat them even it is a <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. མི་སེར] A term that can mean serf/bound subject as well as citizen, depending on context. For example, the miser of a lord would connote the bound subjects of that lord, whereas the miser of Tibet would connote citizens of Tibet.">miser</a> of someone else?   

**A:**  Even it it is a <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. མི་སེར] A term that can mean serf/bound subject as well as citizen, depending on context. For example, the miser of a lord would connote the bound subjects of that lord, whereas the miser of Tibet would connote citizens of Tibet.">miser</a> of someone else we can beat them probably without having to ask the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. རྫོང] A district in the traditional Tibetan governmental structure. This large administrative unit was headed by one or two district heads (tib. dzongpön [རྫོང་དཔོན]) appointed by the Tibetan government. Typically there was one lay official and one monk official who were jointly sent from Lhasa for three year terms. They were responsible for collecting taxes and adjudicating disputes in their district. These dzong were equivalent to counties (ch. 县) in the current Chinese system of administration.">dzong</a> first.   

**Q:**  Have you beat people?   

**A:**  A little beating with hand and stick, but not much since I was the senior drunyer.   

**Q:**  Can you confiscate goods from the debtors?   

**A:**  They were allowed to bring their things to the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཕྱག་སྦུག] A manager (of estates and endowments) of a monastic college or monastic khamtsen.">chabu</a> for repaying the loan and the chabu will accept it.   

**Q:**  The <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. འབྲུ་གཉེར] A steward (nyerpa) in charge of grain.">drunyer</a> is not allowed to rob things for the loans, right?   

**A:**  Yes. But once, I took a coral head ornament, <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. སྤ་ཕྲུག] The traditional woman&#x27;s headdress.">patrug</a> [Tib. སྤ་ཕྲུག] from a woman by saying it will be kept as a pawn [Tib. གཏའ་མ] until you pay the gyeje debt. If you the repay the loan in certain time , you can take back the patrug. If you don't pay it we will give it to the tratsang. This family ultimately paid the debt and we returned the patrug.   

**Q:**  Who transports the grain from the storehouse to the monastery? Did they have to impose tax on the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. མི་སེར] A term that can mean serf/bound subject as well as citizen, depending on context. For example, the miser of a lord would connote the bound subjects of that lord, whereas the miser of Tibet would connote citizens of Tibet.">miser</a>?   

**A:**  The <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. མི་སེར] A term that can mean serf/bound subject as well as citizen, depending on context. For example, the miser of a lord would connote the bound subjects of that lord, whereas the miser of Tibet would connote citizens of Tibet.">miser</a> transports it as a tax or the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. གྲྭ་ཚང] A &quot;college&quot; within a monastery, for example, in Drepung Monastery there were four main tratsang: Gomang, Loseling, Deyang and Ngagpa. These tratsang were property owning corporate entities and included monks who were organized into residential dormitories called Khamtsen.">tratsang</a> would hire animals for that and pay the fees. This is not our concern. The <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཕྱག་སྦུག] A manager (of estates and endowments) of a monastic college or monastic khamtsen.">chabu</a> does this by taking out the grain from the storage.
