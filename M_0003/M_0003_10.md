**Q:**  Did they fight in the assembly hall, <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. འདུ་ཁང] An assembly hall in a monastery.">dukhang</a> [Tib. འདུ་ཁང] for a long time? We heard the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. དཔེ་ཆ་བ] A monk studying the monastic philosophical curriculum. A scholar monk.">pechawa</a> had to serve rice gruel <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཐུག་པ] 1. A porridge or gruel-like soup typically made with tsamba, and if available, meat and cheese. 2. Noodle dishes in broth.">thukpa</a> because the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཨ་མདོ] One of the three main Tibetan sub-ethnic areas. It is located in the northeast of the Tibetan Plateau mostly in today&#x27;s Qinghai Province. A person from Amdo is called an Amdowa.">Amdo</a> didn't serve the thukpa and left and the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. བོད་པ] 1. A person from Central Tibet (tib. དབུས) or sometimes someone from political Tibet in contrast to persons from Kham and Amdo. 2. Böpa is also used nowadays as a general name for all ethnic Tibetans.">böba</a> stayed there. Was it true?   

**A:**  No, it was not like this. It was a short time fight and they continued serving <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཐུག་པ] 1. A porridge or gruel-like soup typically made with tsamba, and if available, meat and cheese. 2. Noodle dishes in broth.">thukpa</a> in line. The <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཨ་མདོ] One of the three main Tibetan sub-ethnic areas. It is located in the northeast of the Tibetan Plateau mostly in today&#x27;s Qinghai Province. A person from Amdo is called an Amdowa.">Amdo</a> didn't leave. It is impossible to have happened like this.   

**Q:**  There wasn't any big disturbance in the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཚོགས] 1. A prayer assembly meeting in monasteries when all the monks come to an assembly hall and chant prayers together. 2. An offering made of tsamba, butter and dry cheese in the shape of a cone.">tsog</a>, right?   

**A:**  Yes. It was a fight between several <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཐུག་པ] 1. A porridge or gruel-like soup typically made with tsamba, and if available, meat and cheese. 2. Noodle dishes in broth.">thukpa</a> servers. But that night there was a big fight invloving a lot of monks outside the monastery where it was said that there were 22 people. There wasn't any fight in the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཚོགས] 1. A prayer assembly meeting in monasteries when all the monks come to an assembly hall and chant prayers together. 2. An offering made of tsamba, butter and dry cheese in the shape of a cone.">tsog</a> where 22 people were involved.   

**Q:**  Do the shengo call them to the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཚོགས་ཆེན] The main assembly hall of a monastery. The assembly hall for the monastery as a whole.">tsogchen</a> stone floor and beat them with switches?   

**A:**  Yes. Near the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཚོགས་ཆེན] The main assembly hall of a monastery. The assembly hall for the monastery as a whole.">tsogchen</a> stone floor, there was a place where the shengo sits and they beat them in that place. There is a triangle stone in the stone floor where they beat people with switches.   

**Q:**  What is that stone near the stone steps in the stone floor which looks like the stage for mounting horses [Tib. ཆིབས་བཀྱག]?   

**A:**  The stone in the middle is the Dalai Lama's throne where the present Dalai Lama sat when he took his <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. དགེ་ཤེས] An advanced degree earned by scholar monks.">geshe</a> exam. Trindor: Oh I see! Once a foreigner sat on this stone and a young monk told him, "don't sit on it".   

**A:**  On the two sides there are two small stones for the two tutors to the Dalai Lama. And they would put some other cushions on it.   

**Q:**  Was there this kind of pushing and shoving in the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཚོགས་ཆེན] The main assembly hall of a monastery. The assembly hall for the monastery as a whole.">tshogchen</a> at the time of serving <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཐུག་པ] 1. A porridge or gruel-like soup typically made with tsamba, and if available, meat and cheese. 2. Noodle dishes in broth.">thukpa</a> and <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. མང་ཇ] The morning tea served to monks from all the monastic colleges at the main prayer assembly hall.">mangja</a>?   

**A:**  There was not much that kind of fight though there should be because there are the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ལྡབ་ལྡོབ] A mildly deviant type of fighting or &quot;punk&quot; monk who engaged in fighting and other unusual behaviors for monks in traditional Tibet&#x27;s large monasteries.">dobdo</a> of the 4 <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. གྲྭ་ཚང] A &quot;college&quot; within a monastery, for example, in Drepung Monastery there were four main tratsang: Gomang, Loseling, Deyang and Ngagpa. These tratsang were property owning corporate entities and included monks who were organized into residential dormitories called Khamtsen.">tratsang</a> during the ceremonies of the Dalai Lama, but there hasn't been a big well known incident there. There is no pushing and shoving in the tshogchen. When the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཐུག་པ] 1. A porridge or gruel-like soup typically made with tsamba, and if available, meat and cheese. 2. Noodle dishes in broth.">thukpa</a> servers come to the rows, the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཆབ་རིལ] The Chabril&#x27;s main work was overseeing serving the traja. He was also the servant of the gegö and khempo. It had a middle status of the types of lene. The chabril was also the one responsible for beating the gong at the tsog and chöra. The chabril got an extra share of gye in the tratsang.">chabril</a> have a lot to behave imposing [Tib. ཉམས]. The tukpa container, sola [Tib. ཟོ་ལག] in <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. སྒོ་མང] One of the large colleges in Drepung Monastery.">Gomang</a> has no straps, so it is wrapped with monk's shawls which they borrow from some young monks sitting at the end of the row. They would keep there <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. རྩམ་པ] The traditional Tibetan staple food that consists of grain that is roasted (popped), usually in heated sand, and then ground into a flour.">tsamba</a> bag in their monk's robe's pouch [Tib. ཨམ་ཕྲག] and place the thukpa container on it. At this time, the chabril would carry a pencase, nyugtro [Tib. སྙུག་ཁྲོག] and he hits the sola with the nyugtro and says , "serve the thukpa" [Tib. ཞུས་བཞེས་ཐུག] and then he says "serve fast" [Tib. མ་ལག་རྒོབས] and then they serve the monks in the first row and then he says, "turn to the east" [Tib. ཁ་ཤར་སློག" and they serve the thukpa there and he says, "get out" [Tib. མར་ཐོན] and when they get out, the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཨ་མདོ] One of the three main Tibetan sub-ethnic areas. It is located in the northeast of the Tibetan Plateau mostly in today&#x27;s Qinghai Province. A person from Amdo is called an Amdowa.">Amdo</a> and <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. བོད་པ] 1. A person from Central Tibet (tib. དབུས) or sometimes someone from political Tibet in contrast to persons from Kham and Amdo. 2. Böpa is also used nowadays as a general name for all ethnic Tibetans.">böba</a> grab each other by the back of their neck and smash them against the wall and try to get out, this is where the Amdo and böba compete their ability. In other tratsang, the thukpa servers could get out through the other rows, but in Gomang, when the thukpa servers exit, they had to go through the same door from where they came in. When they first come in carrying the thukpa, they hit the ladle on the pillars to show off and the first and the second place servers would hit more hard.   

**Q:**  Tell us about how they bring the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཐུག་པ] 1. A porridge or gruel-like soup typically made with tsamba, and if available, meat and cheese. 2. Noodle dishes in broth.">thukpa</a> from the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. རུང་ཁང] A monastic kitchen.">rungkhang</a> and how they first serve the thukpa.   

**A:**  In <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. སྒོ་མང] One of the large colleges in Drepung Monastery.">Gomang</a>, there are 13 rows in the dukhang. When the tea and <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཐུག་པ] 1. A porridge or gruel-like soup typically made with tsamba, and if available, meat and cheese. 2. Noodle dishes in broth.">thukpa</a> servers first come in, 6-7 people go in the first row and then 5 people go to serve the other rows and 2-3 people in some other rows. Usually, the tea have the grease [Tib. ཞག] and the thukpa have not. After they served the thukpa in the rows, they would accumulate the sola in two lines at the end of row.   

**Q:**  To which row would they go to get the first serving of the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཐུག་པ] 1. A porridge or gruel-like soup typically made with tsamba, and if available, meat and cheese. 2. Noodle dishes in broth.">thukpa</a>?   

**A:**  First they go to the front row.   

**Q:**  Who would call the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ལྡབ་ལྡོབ] A mildly deviant type of fighting or &quot;punk&quot; monk who engaged in fighting and other unusual behaviors for monks in traditional Tibet&#x27;s large monasteries.">dobdo</a> to stand up to serve the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཐུག་པ] 1. A porridge or gruel-like soup typically made with tsamba, and if available, meat and cheese. 2. Noodle dishes in broth.">thukpa</a>?   

**A:**  No. They don't call. The <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ལྡབ་ལྡོབ] A mildly deviant type of fighting or &quot;punk&quot; monk who engaged in fighting and other unusual behaviors for monks in traditional Tibet&#x27;s large monasteries.">dobdo</a> would pull and rush [Tib. འཚང་ག] severely.   

**Q:**  Wasn't there any kind of limit to stop them from pushing?   

**A:**  They get up by themselves to serve <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཐུག་པ] 1. A porridge or gruel-like soup typically made with tsamba, and if available, meat and cheese. 2. Noodle dishes in broth.">thukpa</a> at the end of the 2nd tea. As soon as the second tea is served, <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ལྡབ་ལྡོབ] A mildly deviant type of fighting or &quot;punk&quot; monk who engaged in fighting and other unusual behaviors for monks in traditional Tibet&#x27;s large monasteries.">dobdo</a> would get crowed there in the corners of the rungkhang. They would get beaten, but they still remain there.   

**Q:**  You mean they didn't let them enter the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. རུང་ཁང] A monastic kitchen.">rungkhang</a>, right?   

**A:**  Yes. When they saw them staying in the corners of the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. རུང་ཁང] A monastic kitchen.">rungkhang</a>, they would beat them severely.   

**Q:**  Who would beat them?   

**A:**  At the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. རུང་ཁང] A monastic kitchen.">rungkhang</a> door there were <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཇ་མ] The monk(s) in charge of a monastery&#x27;s kitchen.">jama</a> and nanga and they would beat them. After that, when they beat the gong to say its time for <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཐུག་པ] 1. A porridge or gruel-like soup typically made with tsamba, and if available, meat and cheese. 2. Noodle dishes in broth.">thukpa</a>, they [dobdo] are allowed into the rungkhang. The stove for making thukpa was about this high and before that, there were about 50-60 servers all around the stove and the first one who scoop out their thukpa have to step on the people's backs and heads to try to get out because all the servers were crowed there. And of course, the servers who get the first and the second place might have been hidden themselves some where in the corners of the rungkhang.   

**Q:**  Do the servers who get the first and second place go right away to the front row?   

**A:**  At the end of the front row, it was blocked by a jayog. He lets the first 5-6 servers in the front row and then 2-4 others were sent to other rows.   

**Q:**  Where do the first and the second place go?   

**A:**  They had already been to the front row.   

**Q:**  Wouldn't the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཇ་གཡོག] Assistant to the Jama (The monk who is in charge of a monastery&#x27;s kitchen).">jayog</a> stop them?   

**A:**  Although we, the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཇ་གཡོག] Assistant to the Jama (The monk who is in charge of a monastery&#x27;s kitchen).">jayog</a> would stay around the front row, but wouldn't have time to stop them and they would go directly to the front row and they get the first and the second place. I heard that the monks in the front row would not take much of the first and second serve. They think that it might not be clean because the servers might have hidden the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཐུག་པ] 1. A porridge or gruel-like soup typically made with tsamba, and if available, meat and cheese. 2. Noodle dishes in broth.">thukpa</a> some where. Once I saw a monk came to the first row before the gong was beaten. He was beaten a lot for this violation. In the past, some monks who didn't get sola for putting thukpa, they took the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཐབ་གཡོག] Monks or laymen who work as servants/manual laborers in kitchens (normally monastic kitchens).">thabyog</a>'s bucket for carrying water   

**Q:**  Supposing there were 50 <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཐུག་པ] 1. A porridge or gruel-like soup typically made with tsamba, and if available, meat and cheese. 2. Noodle dishes in broth.">thukpa</a> servers, after you couldn't stop the first 5-6 servers, they go to the front row and serve the thukpa and then they come back. Then do you let the remaining 40 some servers wait in line and then you send them in to serve the thukpa one after another?   

**A:**  There is a line up of two lines of the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཐུག་པ] 1. A porridge or gruel-like soup typically made with tsamba, and if available, meat and cheese. 2. Noodle dishes in broth.">thukpa</a> sola which is stopped there and at this time, the chabri would give a speech, [Tib. tsgogs gtam] "the rich sponsor have offered the materaials in kind like using the endless heavenly treaure, so you should serve it to the front, the end and the middle so that there would not be any shortage. If there is shortage, it is like having shortage of gold and if there is left over, it is like left over water. I have given you the order." [Tib. sbyin bdag 'byor pa can gyis rgyu cha lag 'don gyi tshul la/ mi zad nam mka' mdzod la mnga' brnyes pa lta bu zhig yod red/ dral 'go gral gzhug btha' dkyil bar gsum la/ chad lhag med pa yin thag thag zhus shog/ chad na gser chad pa yin/ lhag na chu lhag pa yin/ bkod pa bshad yod dag]. Then they start serving thukpa sometimes from the east or sometimes from the west or sometimes from the middle.   

**Q:**  I heard that when the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ལྡབ་ལྡོབ] A mildly deviant type of fighting or &quot;punk&quot; monk who engaged in fighting and other unusual behaviors for monks in traditional Tibet&#x27;s large monasteries.">dobdo</a> go to get <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཐུག་པ] 1. A porridge or gruel-like soup typically made with tsamba, and if available, meat and cheese. 2. Noodle dishes in broth.">thukpa</a> they leave their cloak, <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཟླ་གམ] The cloak monks wear at the prayer assembly sessions.">dagam</a> [Tib. ཟླ་གམ] there and in the time between, they poured out full sola of thukpa in their cloak to be taken away. This is like stealing, right?   

**A:**  They weren't allowed to do that.   

**A:**  They were not allowed to that,but were there people doing this?   

**A:**  It's dark at the east and west ends of <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. འདུ་ཁང] An assembly hall in a monastery.">dukhang</a> where the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ལྡབ་ལྡོབ] A mildly deviant type of fighting or &quot;punk&quot; monk who engaged in fighting and other unusual behaviors for monks in traditional Tibet&#x27;s large monasteries.">dobdo</a> sit, so they pour some more <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཐུག་པ] 1. A porridge or gruel-like soup typically made with tsamba, and if available, meat and cheese. 2. Noodle dishes in broth.">thukpa</a>. I don't know if they had poured a whole sola of thukpa. But if the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཇ་མ] The monk(s) in charge of a monastery&#x27;s kitchen.">jama</a> or <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཆབ་རིལ] The Chabril&#x27;s main work was overseeing serving the traja. He was also the servant of the gegö and khempo. It had a middle status of the types of lene. The chabril was also the one responsible for beating the gong at the tsog and chöra. The chabril got an extra share of gye in the tratsang.">chabril</a> happened to catch them, they get beaten severely. Normally, they were allowed to serve only two ladles of rice gruels thukpa and it is hard to hold in the wooden bowl. There is a saying, he had fermented the thukpa [Tib. "་ཐུག་པ་བསྙལ] which means he got extra thukpa and kept there. [usually the term [Tib. བསྙལ] used for fermenting chang]   

**Q:**  Do the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ལྡབ་ལྡོབ] A mildly deviant type of fighting or &quot;punk&quot; monk who engaged in fighting and other unusual behaviors for monks in traditional Tibet&#x27;s large monasteries.">dobdo</a> eat <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཐུག་པ] 1. A porridge or gruel-like soup typically made with tsamba, and if available, meat and cheese. 2. Noodle dishes in broth.">thukpa</a> from the ladle while in line or throw some to the young monks who lend them the monk's shawl?   

**A:**  They were not allowed to eat it because all the monks are watching. But they throw pieces of meat to the young monks because they lend them the shawal. Usually, they would tell the young monks,"lend me your shawal, I will throw pieces of meat". And they would throw pieces of meat, but not the thukpa. Even they threw this, it doesn't cause any big trouble. I also heard that in the Mönlam, in the area called Bugtsang [Tib. སྦུག་ཚང] in the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཇོ་ཁང] A most famous temple in Lhasa that houses a holy statue of the Buddha. It is often used to mean the Tsuglagang Temple of which it is a part.">Jokhang</a>, they pour the grease of the tea not in their bowl but in the tea silver container Tashi Tsering: I saw in the Mönlam that the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. དགེ་ཤེས] An advanced degree earned by scholar monks.">geshe</a> would bring not only their bowl, but a aluminum pot with them to keep the grease and then they put the grease in the pot.   

**A:**  Yes. In the Mönlam, the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. དགེ་ཤེས] An advanced degree earned by scholar monks.">geshe</a> couldn't drink the tea because it was full of grease. So they put the grease in the pot.   

**Q:**  I heard that just before the New Year when they recite prayers for the Matria Buddha, chamön [Tib. བྱམས་སྨོན] for 8 days, some monks recite the prayers and they were given piles of the fried cookies, tönchen [Tib. སྟོན་ཆེན] but some would play flute. Was that true?   

**A:**  I can swear that I didn't see them playing flute. It was not a real tönchen, they hold the assembly and the Drepung <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. སྤྱི་བསོ] The head managers/stewards of monasteries as a whole, especially the large Gelugpa monasteries like Sera and Drepung.">jiso</a> would give butter, salt and baking soda.   

**Q:**  How much butter do they give?   

**A:**  We get small square pieces of butter like this and it was given for 8 days.   

**Q:**  How much salt do they give?   

**A:**  They give one iron ladle called jagsar [Tib. lcagd zar] and a little baking soda. But the main thing was the butter.   

**Q:**  Trindor: I heard that in the middle they recite the prayers, but the monks sittig around would blow whistle and play flute, did they do that?   

**A:**  It's possible since Drepung <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཚོགས་ཆེན] The main assembly hall of a monastery. The assembly hall for the monastery as a whole.">tsogchen</a> dukhang is a hall with 280 pillars with 24 long pillars in the center. Usually, the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. སྒོ་མང] One of the large colleges in Drepung Monastery.">Gomang</a> tratsang had 108 pillars. Now here we have 12 long pillars. At that time, the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཚོགས་ཆེན] The main assembly hall of a monastery. The assembly hall for the monastery as a whole.">tshogchen</a> is packed with monks.   

**Q:**  I heard that the young monks sitting at the ends do those things like playing flutes.   

**A:**  Probably, they do, but when I was a young monk I have never been to the places where they do that and when I became older, I came to the seats in the middle. Oh I think I cannot say that they didn't blow the flute because by that time, the discipline was loosen for the New Year and the monks were allowed to play. Although I have never seeen and heard, but it is possible.   

**Q:**  The reason for having many monks gathered was for the butter salary?   

**A:**  Yes. They come for the square butter. When the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. དགེ་ཕྲུག] 1. Student. 2. Disciple. 3. Commonly the name for monks living with a gegen or teacher. These are more like wards than real disciples.">gidru</a> gets the butter, they cut off a small strip of the butter by using a string and eat it with <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. རྩམ་པ] The traditional Tibetan staple food that consists of grain that is roasted (popped), usually in sand, and then ground into a flour.">tsampa</a> hand over the remaining to the gegen. [laughter] And this also had a name called "using horse tail" [Tib. རྟ་རྔ་བཏང]. Actually, they need horse tail, but it can be cut with any string also. Normally, there were 7 people who are in charge of overseeing the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཚོགས] 1. A prayer assembly meeting in monasteries when all the monks come to an assembly hall and chant prayers together. 2. An offering made of tsamba, butter and dry cheese in the shape of a cone.">tsog</a>; 2 shengo, 2 <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ནང་མ] A minor monk assistant to the Shengo at the Mönlam Chemmo Prayer Festival. These nangma ranked below the Chagdampa.">nangma</a>, 2 <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཆབ་རིལ] The Chabril&#x27;s main work was overseeing serving the traja. He was also the servant of the gegö and khempo. It had a middle status of the types of lene. The chabril was also the one responsible for beating the gong at the tsog and chöra. The chabril got an extra share of gye in the tratsang.">chabril</a>, lama migtsema. And the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཇ་མ] The monk(s) in charge of a monastery&#x27;s kitchen.">jama</a> have to stay in the rungkhang. But there are too many monks in the hall with over 200 pillars, so they can't handle them.   

**Q:**  The shengo has big income but also you said they had big expesnses. What are these expenses?   

**A:**  First he has to give a rice gruel <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཐུག་པ] 1. A porridge or gruel-like soup typically made with tsamba, and if available, meat and cheese. 2. Noodle dishes in broth.">thukpa</a> and alms to his <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. གྲྭ་ཚང] A &quot;college&quot; within a monastery, for example, in Drepung Monastery there were four main tratsang: Gomang, Loseling, Deyang and Ngagpa. These tratsang were property owning corporate entities and included monks who were organized into residential dormitories called Khamtsen.">tratsang</a>, then also to his <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཁང་ཚན] A monastic residential unit in which monks from specific geographic areas lived. These were corporate entities with property and internal officials. Some large khamtsen had smaller subordinate units called mi tshan. Khamtsen were part of tratsang (colleges). For example, Hamdong Khamtsen was part of Gomang College in Drepung Monastery.">khamtsen</a> and mitsen.   

**Q:**  How much alms did the shengo give in 1958 at the time of <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. སྒོ་མང] One of the large colleges in Drepung Monastery.">Gomang</a> trouble?   

**A:**  Probably not too much, it might be like 10 <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཏམ་ཀ] A unit in the traditional Tibetan currency system that was equal to 4 sang.">tranka</a>, 1 sang. But the rice gruel <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཐུག་པ] 1. A porridge or gruel-like soup typically made with tsamba, and if available, meat and cheese. 2. Noodle dishes in broth.">thukpa</a> cost a lot because they have to use alot of butter. [rice gruel have 3 names; thukpa mingtag [Tib. མིང་བཏགས] pagtsöma, [Tib. སྤགས་ཚོས་མ] and damja [Tib. དམ་བཅའ]. The shengo's <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. གཏོང་སྒོ] A monastic obligation to provide the food and other necessary items served at a monastic prayer assembly meeting or some other rite; this was often a required obligation for monastic officials at the end of their term of office.">tonggo</a> is 3 teas and 1 thukpa in the tratsang. And then the same in the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཁང་ཚན] A monastic residential unit in which monks from specific geographic areas lived.

Probably, some of the mitsen had become exhaused or extinct [Tib. སྟོངས] and some were merged together. Most famous was the Outter Mongolia [Tib. ཕྱི་སོག] called Khalka mitsen.

Gendün Nyima's <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཤག་ཚང] 1. The household or family of a monk that consisted of multiple monks. 2. The apartment of a monk household.">shagtsang</a> did the nyertsang for 3 years. During this time, they gave a poor <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. གཏོང་སྒོ] A monastic obligation to provide the food and other necessary items served at a monastic prayer assembly meeting or some other rite; this was often a required obligation for monastic officials at the end of their term of office.">tonggo</a> to the monks where the butter they served at <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. གྲྭ་ཇ] The prayer session sponsored by the tratsang (college) at which tea was served to its monks who attended.">traja</a> was also mixed inferior butter like we have nowadays. And he also used the tea produced from <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. མཚོ་སྣ] A district in southern Tibet.">Tsöna</a> [Tib. མཚོ་སྣ]. I just heard about it and I didn't go to <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཚོགས] 1. A prayer assembly meeting in monasteries when all the monks come to an assembly hall and chant prayers together. 2. An offering made of tsamba, butter and dry cheese in the shape of a cone.">tsog</a> so During their three years terms their income and the expenditure became unbalanced where the expenditure was little bit less than the income. So they ambiciously [Tib. ཧམ་པ་བྱས] asked for nyertsang for another 3 years. This time, there were more much expenditures than the income at the end of the term. So when they hand over the nyertsang to the new like the saying, "use the root as the capital and use the leaves for giving tonggo" [Tib. རྩ་བས་རྩ་བྱས། ལོ་མས་གཏོང་སྒོ་བཏང], there was a great shortage [Tib. ཆད].

The apartment/room of a monk. 2. The butter fat that coagulates on the top of butter-tea when the tea is left to sit for some time. If the tea had been made with a lot of butter, this layer could be thick enough to scoop off and save to later sell or eat separately. The senior monks are usually served tea with a lot of shag.">shag</a> and make it up. My relative paid back his share, but Gendün Nyima's shag wasn't able to pay it back and there was a great problem [Tib. ཁ་ཆག་སྣ་རལ]. It was because of this that they had to go to the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. སྒོ་མང] One of the large colleges in Drepung Monastery.">Gomang</a> abbot and he made it so that Gendün Nyima's <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. དགེ་རྒན] 1.

In such cases, the younger monk typically lived in the gegen&#x27;s apartment (shag).

Normally, nyertsang had a high rank and they wear the satin vest [Tib. གོས་ཆེན་སྟོད་འགག] and they get a big name of the ex-nyertsang. When the Dali Lama was in <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. གྲོ་མོ] The Tibetan name for the town that is located on the Sikkim/India border that the Chinese call Yadong.">Tromo</a> and <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཀླུ་ཁང་བ] The family name of a famous aristocratic lay official who was one of the two Sitsab in 1950-52.">Lukhangwa</a> [Tib. ཀླུ་ཁང་བ] and Lobsang Tashi [Tib. བློ་བཟང་བཀྲ་ཤིས] were <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. སྲིད་ཚབ] An acting Silön (Chief/Prime Minister). Two silön were appointed in 1950 when the Dalai Lama left Lhasa for the safety of Yadong on the Sikkim/Indian border.">sitsab</a>, Gendün Nyima's gegen went through the back door relation and got his nyertsang thönsin back. And he was also appointed as the candidate for the jiso and he grabbed for the position of the jiso, Gendün Nyima was related to Taglungdra, so they had the great confident that they would get it, but his opponent was the famous one nicknamed "tiger with torn up mouth" Takharel [Tib. སྟག་ཁ་རལ]. Takharel had both wealth and backers. So Takharel got the jiso position and Gendün Nyima was lost in the competition and just got only a dry name of the ex-nyertsang and he also had a bad name saying that he didn't give a good tonggo. And then, he became poor and was shortage of a lot of money. So the abbot who was from the same <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. མི་ཚན] A sub-unit of a khamtsen.">mitsen</a> with Gendün Nyima felt pity on him and gave him the tratsang umdze position.
