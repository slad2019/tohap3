**Q:**  Actually, how many thabyog were there?   

**A:**  I don't remember very clearly. There were 4-5 thabyog. Normally, when they receive the alms from the monastery, they would receive 9 people's alms share. In the monastery, when they would give a kind of feast called tönchen [Tib. ston chen] where meat and droma dresi was served, they will give them 9 people's share.   

**Q:**  You were talking about Hamdong [Tib. har gdong] Khamtsen, right?   

**A:**  Yes.   

**Q:**  How many thabyog were there in the tratsang?   

**A:**  In the tratsang, there were 9 thabyog and there was one layman called daily worker, nyinlepa [Tib. nyin las pa].   

**Q:**  What dose it mean by nyinlepa?

**A:**  He was a layman.   

**Q:**  He was called nyinlepa right?   

**A:**  Yes.   

**Q:**  Did you know how many thabyog were there in the tsogchen]?   

**A:**  There were a large number of thabyog in the tsogchen. There were 8 permanent thabyog [Tib. gtan sdod pa] who were permanently staying there. There were more then 20 people who were fetching water. In the past, there were 8 thabyog who were the main thabyog among the thabyog called the "4 apha" [Tib. a pha bzhi].  As I said there were 8 permanent thabyog who were the main thabyog. They have to work for the Drepung tsogchen shengo when they were made to work, but they didn't have to do the works related to political and economic matters. For example, they have to go wherever the tsogchen shengo called them. If the shengo want to arrest somebody, they would send the thabyog to arrest the monk. At that time, they will sent the thabyog to arrest monks like nowadays, the Public Security members [Ch. gong an] were sent to arrest people.
