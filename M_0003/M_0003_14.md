**Q:**  Actually, how many <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཐབ་གཡོག] Monks or laymen who work as servants/manual laborers in kitchens (normally monastic kitchens).">thabyog</a> were there?   

**A:**  I don't remember very clearly. There were 4-5 thabyog. Normally, when they receive the alms from the monastery, they would receive 9 people's alms share. In the monastery, when they would give a kind of feast called tönchen [Tib. སྟོན་ཆེན] where meat and <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. གྲོ་མ་འབྲས་སིལ] A special dish consisting of sweetened rice, melted butter and wild sweet potatoes (gro ma).">droma dresi</a> was served, they will give them 9 people's share.

**A:**  Yes.   

**Q:**  How many <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཐབ་གཡོག] Monks or laymen who work as servants/manual laborers in kitchens (normally monastic kitchens).">thabyog</a> were there in the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. གྲྭ་ཚང] A &quot;college&quot; within a monastery, for example, in Drepung Monastery there were four main tratsang: Gomang, Loseling, Deyang and Ngagpa.

**A:**  In the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. གྲྭ་ཚང] A &quot;college&quot; within a monastery, for example, in Drepung Monastery there were four main tratsang: Gomang, Loseling, Deyang and Ngagpa.

**Q:**  What dose it mean by nyinlepa?

As I said there were 8 permanent thabyog who were the main thabyog. They have to work for the Drepung tsogchen shengo when they were made to work, but they didn't have to do the works related to political and economic matters. For example, they have to go wherever the tsogchen shengo called them. If the shengo want to arrest somebody, they would send the thabyog to arrest the monk. At that time, they will sent the thabyog to arrest monks like nowadays, the Public Security members [Ch. gong an] were sent to arrest people.
