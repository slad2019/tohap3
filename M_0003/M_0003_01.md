**A:**  I'm 74. I'm not an expert on religion, politics and science, but I stayed in monastery for a long time so I know something.   

**Q:**  How old are you? How did you first get into the monastery? How old were you when you came to the monastery? Where were you born?   

**A:**  I was born in Phembo Lhündrup Dzong [Tib. འཕན་པོ་ལྷུན་གྲུབ་རྫོང]. I became a monk at age 7. My <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. དགེ་རྒན] 1. Teacher in a school. 2. In monastic settings it also refers to an adult monk who acted as a guardian to a younger monk. In such cases, the younger monk typically lived in the gegen&#x27;s apartment (shag). In monasteries, however, it could also mean a real teacher, or the monk who served as the guarantor for a new monk.">gegen</span> was my relative as well as a <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. ལྡབ་ལྡོབ] A mildly deviant type of fighting or &quot;punk&quot; monk who engaged in fighting and other unusual behaviors for monks in traditional Tibet&#x27;s large monasteries.">dobdo</span>, so we <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. དགེ་ཕྲུག] 1. Student. 2. Disciple. 3. Commonly the name for monks living with a gegen or teacher. These are more like wards than real disciples.">gidru</span> couldn't learn any knowledge. His name was Chömphel <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. རྣམ་རྒྱལ] 1. A person&#x27;s name. 2. The name of the Dalai Lama&#x27;s monastery located in the Potala Palace [tib. rnam rgyal grwa tshamg].">Namgyal</span> [Tib. ཆོས་འཕེལ་རྣམ་རྒྱལ]. My name is Wöser Chökyong [Tib. འོད་ཟེར་ཆོས་སྐྱོང].   

**Q:**  How did you first get in the monastery? Did your parents find your <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. དགེ་རྒན] 1. Teacher in a school. 2. In monastic settings it also refers to an adult monk who acted as a guardian to a younger monk. In such cases, the younger monk typically lived in the gegen&#x27;s apartment (shag). In monasteries, however, it could also mean a real teacher, or the monk who served as the guarantor for a new monk.">gegen</span>?   

**A:**  My parents brought me to the apartment (shag) of my <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. དགེ་རྒན] 1. Teacher in a school. 2. In monastic settings it also refers to an adult monk who acted as a guardian to a younger monk. In such cases, the younger monk typically lived in the gegen&#x27;s apartment (shag). In monasteries, however, it could also mean a real teacher, or the monk who served as the guarantor for a new monk.">gegen</span> who was my maternal uncle. And so my mother told him not to beat me and to be kind to me. So later, as my gegen was a <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. ལྡབ་ལྡོབ] A mildly deviant type of fighting or &quot;punk&quot; monk who engaged in fighting and other unusual behaviors for monks in traditional Tibet&#x27;s large monasteries.">dobdo</span>, he didn't have the experience in religion. So he did not teach me and also did not find me a book-reading teacher (pechai gegan) on the pretext that this would anger my mother since if I studied, I would get beaten. Actually, eventhough he couldn't teach me, he should have sent me to one of those pechai gegan which he could have found as there were lot of them. Now when I look back, I draw two conclusions. On the one hand, the gegen was to blame for me not having good education in pecha. On the other hand, had the gegen not accepted me, I wouldn't have had the opportunity to live in one of the great monastic seats and get the alms. So I feel like he is the same as my root guru [Tib. རྩ་བའ་བླ་མ] and I feel gratitude towards him and I have faith in him.   

**Q:**  Where are you in Drepung? Which <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. གྲྭ་ཚང] A &quot;college&quot; within a monastery, for example, in Drepung Monastery there were four main tratsang: Gomang, Loseling, Deyang and Ngagpa.

There are 13 lines of monks in the dukhang and the jayog has to count and lead the tea servers, chade [Tib. ཕྱག་བདེ་བ]. He leads them into the dukhang where there is 13 lines. In each line 5 chade are sent to do this, the first tea container, chabtra [Tib. ཇ་ཁྲ] has more grease on it since the tea is not churned.

**Q:**  How does the sponsor know who is good to be the jigyab?   

**A:**  They know because the jigyab was done permanently. The sponsor asks the monks who is good and expert at jikyab, and all the monks say that this person is good.

**Q:**  Did they hit each other with the ladle?

**Q:**  How did you make your living?   

**A:**  My main income was from monastery alms and salary and my family and relatives would send some tsampa.   

**Q:**  How much grain salary did you get in <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. སྒོ་མང] One of the large colleges in Drepung Monastery.">Gomang</span>?   

**A:**  When I was young, we got only 1 <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. ཁལ] A traditional volume measurement used for measuring grain in traditional Tibetan society. Sizes of this unit varied somewhat, but the official government khe (called mkhar ru or bstan dzin mkha ru) weighed about 28-31 pounds for barley. It was used to convey the size of fields. For example, a field said to be 10 khe in size meant that 10 khe of seed could be sown on that field.">khe</span> per year from the tratsang. Then there was a famous.

This is taught after the six-year curriculum called düdra.">tsenyi</span> debater for the 9th Panchen Lama. After he was the abbot, some <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. སྒོ་མང] One of the large colleges in Drepung Monastery.">Gomang</span> <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. གཞིས་ཀ] A manorial estate.">shiga</span> were reorganized and we ended up with one more khe per monk per year. The Drepung grain salary is poor. The <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. སྤྱི་བསོ] The head managers/stewards of monasteries as a whole, especially the large Gelugpa monasteries like Sera and Drepung.">jiso</span> only gives 2 khe per year per monk. And these two khe are mixed grain, bean, vicia faba, [Tib. རྒྱ་སྲན] and wheat. The Gomang tratsang pays real barley and real beans. And then just before the revolt there was more reorganizing the shiga and we ended up with 3 khe of grain per monk per year.   

**Q:**  Was this enough with the alms?   

**A:**  No it wasn't, we have to do other means to survive.   

**Q:**  Normally, what food do you eat?   

**A:**  We eat mainly pag. And sometimes we cooked meat with thukpa.   

**Q:**  You may not have vegetables?   

**A:**  Vegetables were very scarce in the past. Mostly we had potatoes, radish and cabbage and the vegetables like asparagus lettuce [Ch. wo sun] and celery [Ch. qin cai] were not available to us.   

**Q:**  How many times did you eat meat in a month?   

**A:**  Twice, three or four times in a month. And if a monk was okay in income he would eat bagtsa marku [Tib. བག་ཚ་མར་ཁུ], small pieces of dough mixed with melted butter, dry cheese and sugar. And at the work place, we eat some meal whatever was there. So as <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. གྲྭ་ཚང] A &quot;college&quot; within a monastery, for example, in Drepung Monastery there were four main tratsang: Gomang, Loseling, Deyang and Ngagpa.

**Q:**  When you get up in the morning, did you make a fire?   

**A:**  Yes, but I only boil black tea. Butter was scarce. The monks having butter tea were few. We had to make fire, since at that time there was no ready made tea to buy. The brick tea had to be boiled.

**A:**  The order was from the <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. ཇ་མ] The monk(s) in charge of a monastery&#x27;s kitchen.">jama</span> and he got this from those above him. In Hamdong <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. ཚོགས་འདུ] 1. The general name for the various types of Tibetan government assemblies. 2. Any assembly, e.g., the assembly (meeting) of monks in a college.">tsondu</span> there were about 40-50 members. If there is a tsondu meeting today, then I have to go and deliver the message to everyone. I also have to deliver the messages to the 29 jikhang [Tib. སྤྱི་ཁང] and 9 <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. མི་ཚན] A sub-unit of a khamtsen.">mitsen</span> and if they have tsondu then I have to go and deliver this message also.   

**Q:**  Do you get any extra salary or food for the <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. ཁང་ཚན] A monastic residential unit in which monks from specific geographic areas lived. These were corporate entities with property and internal officials. Some large khamtsen had smaller subordinate units called mi tshan. Khamtsen were part of tratsang (colleges). For example, Hamdong Khamtsen was part of Gomang College in Drepung Monastery.">khamtsen</span> jayog?   

**A:**  We get some food when they eat food. Between <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. ཇ་མ] The monk(s) in charge of a monastery&#x27;s kitchen.">jama</span> and <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. ཇ་གཡོག] Assistant to the Jama (The monk who is in charge of a monastery&#x27;s kitchen).">jayog</span>, the jama is more important and have a bigger name.   

**Q:**  Did you have salary when you were the <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. ཇ་གཡོག] Assistant to the Jama (The monk who is in charge of a monastery&#x27;s kitchen).">jayog</span>?   

**A:**  No salary.   

**Q:**  Did you get extra alms?   

**A:**  Yes we had little bit extra alms from <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. ཁང་ཚན] A monastic residential unit in which monks from specific geographic areas lived. These were corporate entities with property and internal officials. Some large khamtsen had smaller subordinate units called mi tshan. Khamtsen were part of tratsang (colleges). For example, Hamdong Khamtsen was part of Gomang College in Drepung Monastery.">khamtsen</span>, generally speaking 1 extra share, but sometimes we get 12 shares called thogthabarsum [Tib. ཐོག་མཐའ་བར་གསུམ] which litarally means, in the beginning, the middle and in the end. This is not just for <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. ཇ་གཡོག] Assistant to the Jama (The monk who is in charge of a monastery&#x27;s kitchen).">jayog</span>, there are about 11-12 persons in the khamtsen who get this thogthabarsum. [TN Note: Thogthabarsum is the extra alms share they get when all the monks were in line getting the alms and they can ask for it at the begging of the line, at the middle of the line and the end of the line]   

**Q:**  How did you first get this <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. ཇ་གཡོག] Assistant to the Jama (The monk who is in charge of a monastery&#x27;s kitchen).">jayog</span> work?   

**A:**  Since, the <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. ཇ་གཡོག] Assistant to the Jama (The monk who is in charge of a monastery&#x27;s kitchen).">jayog</span> is hard work with little income, the <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. ཇ་མ] The monk(s) in charge of a monastery&#x27;s kitchen.">jama</span> tries to persuade and insist someone he knows to do the job. People don't try to get it. But if a person isn't capable, he will have a hard time doing this job. I did the Hamdong jama for two years right after I did the jayog. I had to ask for the jama job at the Hamdong tsondu. I need to give 15 <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. སྲང] A unit of traditional Tibetan currency. It was also called ngüsang [tib. དངུལ་སྲང]. 50 nügsang = 1 dotse; 10 sho = 1 nügsang; 20 5-karma coins = 1 ngüsang. There were also paper currency notes of 7-sang, 25-sang, and 10-sang denominations.">sang</span> and a <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. ཁ་བཏགས] A Tibetan ceremonial scarf given to lamas, visitors, etc.">khata</span> Ashe, [Tib. ཨ་ཤེ] as the gift to the tsondu. Hamdong's custom is that you can't exceed this amount or give less than it. If there is one candidate or many, the amount they have to give the same. If there are many askers, they appoint the most capable one. If there is only one, the one is chosen.   

**Q:**  When you were <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. ཇ་མ] The monk(s) in charge of a monastery&#x27;s kitchen.">jama</span>, were there many people trying?   

**A:**  No, there was only me and another one. When <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. ཧར་གདོང་ཁང་ཚན] The name of a residential unit (khamtsen) found in both Drepung and Sera Monasteries.">Hamdong Khamtsen</span>'s sponsor wants to give <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. གཏོང་སྒོ] A monastic obligation to provide the food and other necessary items served at a monastic prayer assembly meeting or some other rite; this was often a required obligation for monastic officials at the end of their term of office.">tonggo</span> at <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. གྲྭ་ཚང] A &quot;college&quot; within a monastery, for example, in Drepung Monastery there were four main tratsang: Gomang, Loseling, Deyang and Ngagpa.

For example, Hamdong Khamtsen was part of Gomang College in Drepung Monastery.">khamtsen</span>, then the jama has to ask the officials in charge on behalf of the Hamdong's sponsor and deliver the list for requesting the prayers, kyabtho [Tib. སྐྱབས་ཐོ] etc. If it is in the tsogchen, the jama has to deliver many messgaes and ask for pemissions. For example, if there is to be a alms tomorrow in tsogchen, today he have to go to the shengo and say, "Tomorrow, Hamdong Khamtsen's [sponsor] is going to give alms, so may he offer this alms. In case the money is not enough may he offer different kind of things, [Tib. དངོས་པོ]". In the early times, if the money is not enough they would offer things. After this, I should say, "May I control the doors on the ceiling, namgo" [Tib. གནམ་སྒོ]. When I was jama, I had to go to the shengo and asked for these permissions, The shengo was surprised when he heard what I said and replied, "Oh, this must be a old custom." I had to give 3 <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. ཁ་བཏགས] A Tibetan ceremonial scarf given to lamas, visitors, etc.">khata</span>. The first was to be allowed to give alms, the second was for controlling, [Tib. དམ་དྲག] the door on the ceiling, [so the monks don't go round and get alms twice;] third was for if the money not enough ask the permission to give things. Then there are some young boys who yell the <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. ཆུ་སྐད] The stylized yelling of young monks from a monastic roof that announces to the monastic community that there will be a distribution of alms in the prayer assembly that day.">chuke</span>, [Tib. ཆུ་སྐད] and when there is alms in the next morning, they have to yell the chuke twice. To them I don't have to give a khata or ask permission, if I inform them that there is alms tomorrow, that's enough. Then there is a <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. བླ་མ་དམིགས་བརྩེ་མ] The geshe monk who recites the Migtsema prayer.">lama migtsema</span> [Tib. བླ་མ་དམིག་བརྩེ་མ] to whom we give the message that there is a alms tomorrow, so gives a notice for the alms [Tib. འགྱེད་བརྡ]. He does this from the roof by reciting a kind of prayer. In the <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. རུང་ཁང] A monastic kitchen.">rungkhang</span>, there are 4 people; 2 jama, chatsü depa [Tib. བྱ་ཚུལ་སྡེ་པ], 1 Tashi Khangsar's [Tib. བྲ་ཤིས་ཁང་གསར] representative.

**Q:**  What notice do the <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. བླ་མ་དམིགས་བརྩེ་མ] The geshe monk who recites the Migtsema prayer.">lama migtsema</span> give?   

**A:**  The <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. བླ་མ་དམིགས་བརྩེ་མ] The geshe monk who recites the Migtsema prayer.">lama migtsema</span>'s prayer notice is recited from a corner of the <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. ཚོགས་ཆེན] The main assembly hall of a monastery. The assembly hall for the monastery as a whole.">tsogchen</span>' roof. The prayer was like the Migtsema prayers, but the tune is longer which the people in the jikhang could hear. When there is alms, he will recite the alms tune [Tib. འགྱེད་རྟ] and all the monks can here it and it tells them there is alms tomorrow.   

**Q:**  Does the <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. བླ་མ་དམིགས་བརྩེ་མ] The geshe monk who recites the Migtsema prayer.">lama migtsema</span> do it himself?   

**A:**  Yes, he himself recites the prayer migtsema the night before, the <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. ཆུ་སྐད] The stylized yelling of young monks from a monastic roof that announces to the monastic community that there will be a distribution of alms in the prayer assembly that day.">chuke</span> was yelled in the morning when there were <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. མང་ཇ] The morning tea served to monks from all the monastic colleges at the main prayer assembly hall.">mangja</span> with alms]. When there is alms in the <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. ཚོགས་ཆེན] The main assembly hall of a monastery.

If there is a <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. གྲྭ་ཚང] A &quot;college&quot; within a monastery, for example, in Drepung Monastery there were four main tratsang: Gomang, Loseling, Deyang and Ngagpa.

I would tell him, "Tomorrow, there is alms in Hamdong khantsen so may I offer the alms" and I would give him one chegye [Tib. ཕེད་བརྒྱད] [  7 and half karma]. Then I go to <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. དགེ་སྐོས] The main disciplinary official in a monastic college (tratsang).">gegö</span> and say as same as I did to the abbot and give him 5 karma. I also have to inform the umdze the same, but there is no money to give him. Also tell tratsang jama that there is alms, so tomorrow please put the new rugs for the <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. སྤྲུལ་སྐུ] An incarnate lama.">trüku</span>, umdze, gegö and abbot. They change the rugs when there is alms, they have raised seats, so have their own rugs] that is the jama's work. Then I ask the jama to raise the amount of water in the cauldron since more monks will come for alms. I also ask jama to take out the vase like container called, chab gyendrugma [Tib. ཆབ་རྐྱན་གྲུ་མ] which usually is kept beside the pillar when there is alms. It is gilded copper. It is put out when there is alms to dress up the tsogkhang. I also tell tratsang chabril that there is alms tomorrow, so please beat the larger gong [the smaller one is used when there is no alms].   

**Q:**  Who actually gives out the alms?   

**A:**  The sponsor themselves gives the alms. The <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. ཁང་ཚན] A monastic residential unit in which monks from specific geographic areas lived. These were corporate entities with property and internal officials. Some large khamtsen had smaller subordinate units called mi tshan. Khamtsen were part of tratsang (colleges). For example, Hamdong Khamtsen was part of Gomang College in Drepung Monastery.">khamtsen</span> jama isn't involved. The sponsor hires some monks who are experienced in giving out alms to do this for him. [This is same for tsogchen and tratsang].   

**Q:**  Please explain how they take the alms share, <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. སྐལ་ལེན] A special right allowing certain monks to take their share of alms outside of the prayer assembly hall. This privilege meant they did not have to attend the prayer session to get their alms.">kelen</span> [Tib. སྐལ་ལེན]. Some have to go get the alms in person and some don't.   

**A:**  The system of <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. སྐལ་ལེན] A special right allowing certain monks to take their share of alms outside of the prayer assembly hall.

The monks who get the kelen sit on the stone floor.   

**Q:**  Is it up to one's own choice to get the <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. སྐལ་ལེན] A special right allowing certain monks to take their share of alms outside of the prayer assembly hall. This privilege meant they did not have to attend the prayer session to get their alms.">kelen</span> or do you have to ask for the permission?   

**A:**  It is up to one's own choice. All monks can do this without having to ask anyone's permission. Usually, there are more monks who collect alms at <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. སྐལ་ལེན] A special right allowing certain monks to take their share of alms outside of the prayer assembly hall. This privilege meant they did not have to attend the prayer session to get their alms.">kelen</span> than sitting in the <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. འདུ་ཁང] An assembly hall in a monastery.">dukhang</span> for the prayers. At kelen, the monks get their alms and then leave. Its really colder in winter to sit outside than inside and there is no tea outside and in the dukhang you sit on a rug and also get tea, but most kelen takers are the ones who don't go to <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. ཚོགས] 1.

In the alms were given at the tsogchen, if a regular monk gets one share, the shengo gets 50 -30 times of that. This is listed in the document called, Gyetong Tsatsig [Tib. འགྱེད་གཏོང་རྩ་ཚིག]. But I do know the tratsang system well. If a regular monk gets 1, then the office of the <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. ཕྱག་སྦུག] A manager (of estates and endowments) of a monastic college or monastic khamtsen.">chabu</span> together gets 40 shares which is called 40 bukel [Tib. སྦུག་སྐལ] then the throne of the Dalai lama, shugtri <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. རིན་པོ་ཆེ] 1. Title for an incarnate lama. 2. Term of address for incarnate lamas.">rinpoche</span> [Tib. བཞུགས་ཁྲི་རིན་པོ་ཆེ ] gets 40 shares, but this actually goes to the 3 <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. དངུལ་གཉེར] Accountant, bookkeeper, cashier.

This makes 12 laymen working for <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. སྒོ་མང] One of the large colleges in Drepung Monastery.">Gomang</span>, 2 sweepers, 9 thabyog and 1 nyerpa. These laymen were all the <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. མི་སེར] A term that can mean serf/bound subject as well as citizen, depending on context. For example, the miser of a lord would connote the bound subjects of that lord, whereas the miser of Tibet would connote citizens of Tibet.">miser</span> of Gomang.   

**Q:**  What kind of income [Tib. ཟ་སྒོ] do the <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. ཇ་མ] The monk(s) in charge of a monastery&#x27;s kitchen.">jama</span> get?   

**A:**  In Hamdong <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. ཁང་ཚན] A monastic residential unit in which monks from specific geographic areas lived. These were corporate entities with property and internal officials. Some large khamtsen had smaller subordinate units called mi tshan. Khamtsen were part of tratsang (colleges).

Normally he gets 2 shares, and sometimes they can get Thogthabarsum. There are 12 officials entitled to receive this. Hamdong's jama has good income. But if there is trouble, then there is a danger of getting beaten with switches and expelled from the monastery. Normally if there is a trouble made by monks, then the shengo summons the khamtsen gegen, but in Hamdong and Samlo khamtsen, the shengo is not allowed to summon these two khamtsen gegen, so he summons the Hamdong jama and Samlo Nyerpa. The Hamdong and Samlo khamtsen gegen and shengo have the same rank, so the latter can't summon the former. If a Hamdong monks has caused trouble, the shengo will send a message to the Hamdong jama saying bring him to my presence tomorrow. Then the jama goes to the relevent monk and says, "Tomorrow you must come to the shengo office, lhengye khang [Tib. ལྷན་རྒྱས་ཁང]." If the monks doesn't show up the next day, then the jama will be scolded by the shengo and even get beaten with switches. And they will tell the jama whatever they want because they had the power then.   

**Q:**  Did you have any personal experience of getting beaten?   

**A:**  Yes, I almost had one incident. I was Hamdong <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. ཁང་ཚན] A monastic residential unit in which monks from specific geographic areas lived. These were corporate entities with property and internal officials. Some large khamtsen had smaller subordinate units called mi tshan. Khamtsen were part of tratsang (colleges). For example, Hamdong Khamtsen was part of Gomang College in Drepung Monastery.">khamtsen</span>'s <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. ཇ་མ] The monk(s) in charge of a monastery&#x27;s kitchen.">jama</span>. Hamdong khamtsen has two <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. ཕྱག་མཛོད] A senior manager/treasurer of an aristocratic or monastic estate, or the senior manager/treasurer of an aristocratic family or a monastic unit. Generally chandzö handled both internal and external issues and were considered higher in power and status than nyerpa (stewards), who typically only handled the storerooms.">chandzö</span>. The khamtsen's common box, jigam [Tib. སྤྱི་སྒམ] is locked and 1 chandzö carries the key and the other places a seal on the box. When this is done, the jama must be present and the common box is not allowed to open without the presence of jama. There are 9 <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. མི་ཚན] A sub-unit of a khamtsen.">mitsen</span> in Hamdong khamtsen. From these 9 mitsen come the 2 chandzö, 2 <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. གཉེར་པ] A steward or manager. In some monasteries, the nyerpa was in charge of storerooms under the authority of a higher manager called a chandzö.">nyerpa</span>, 2 khamtsen gegen. These are appointed from the 9 mitsen by turns. From these posts, the one that is the representative of the pure <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. བོད་པ] 1. A person from Central Tibet (tib. དབུས) or sometimes someone from political Tibet in contrast to persons from Kham and Amdo. 2. Böpa is also used nowadays as a general name for all ethnic Tibetans.">böpa</span> is the Jama. The Hamdong Jama's work seems to be that of a servant, but in the Khamtsen, people refer honorifically to the jama as Jama-la, [Tib. ཇ་མ་ལགས] even after years. At this time, I was the grain steward in Phembo, so I had a horse. One of the main in charge chandzö who worked closely with me received a message through a monk to come the shengo's office. I wondered what it was about. Then the shengo called me and told me to bring him [chandzö] tomorrow. When I went there the shengo said, "Bring the chandzö to me tomorrow. The reason is that someone has accused the chandzö of theft. But the chandzö says I didn't do it, but the other monk says yes he did." So that night when I was there with the shengo, the shengo did not decide whether the chandzö was guilty or not. So the chandzö returned to the khamtsen. Normally, since we ate from the same table [close relations], so I asked him, "It is strange that some body accused you of being a thief. I can't say that you are the thief. I am just wondering whether you are a thief. If you have to meet the shengo about this, then you are in bad trouble. Can't you find a person for doing good office [Tib. འགོ་འདྲེན] for you in Lhasa." He said I do, so I lent him my horse to go that night to find a backer. If you can bring a person to back you that is good, or if not get a letter. You have to do something to avoid having to go to the shengo. So he went that night to Lhasa and that night he returned to Drepung. When I asked him if it was okay now," he said yes. So I said, good. I didn't know whether he was a thief or not, and if he didn't arrive, I would have gotten beaten. People would have said that I helped a thief escape and that I was probably involved with him. So the next day we two went to the shengo office. Then the shengo tied the chandzö's hands and immediately beat him with switches without asking him anything. As soon as the beating started, the chandzö admitted he stole. He was a real thief. He stole a big yellow robe called namjar [Tib. སྣམ་སྦྱར] from a lama. I had actually seen him one day taking apart something from the namjar, but who would have thought that it wasn't his property and that he was a thief. He wanted to fix this to wear this on his mongolian dress and show himself being imposing when he goes to the northern nomad area on business. I was very glad that he came back thinking the my protective deity Gyangkar Nangso [Tib. ?] helped me, otherwise, I would have been in real trouble. If he had fled, I would have been beaten not just once, but it would have gone on for many days since they would have thought I was in cahoots with him and would want me to say where he went. The thief himself was quite good that he returned, if he was a bad peson he would have ran away riding the horse. Another incident occurred just before I did the jama work. At the time of shotön, when they were performing Tibetan opera at Nechung. Before the opera was over, Two monks from the stage grabbed one actor boy who acted as female and took him away by force. [for homosexual acts]. That night the two monks were caught and turned over to the <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. ཆབ་གཡོག] An assistant or servant of the chabu.">chabyog</span>. And the shengo said bring them to me tomorrow. But the two monks fled. So the chabyog was in trouble and was almost expelled from the monastery. In the end they weren't though. He had to bribe the shengo with lot of things. So Hamdong jama is difficult job. The Hamdong jama also has important responsibilities at the Mönlam. For one <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. ཚོགས] 1. A prayer assembly meeting in monasteries when all the monks come to an assembly hall and chant prayers together. 2. An offering made of tsamba, butter and dry cheese in the shape of a cone.">tsog</span> at Mönlam there may be 30 or 40 alms from the Hamdong khamtsen's sponsors. I have to set up rugs for the sponsor on the roof of the Khyamra, and invite the sponsor to come and sit on the rugs, then the jama has to go with the sponsor who carry incense in their hand and go around the monks in tsog.
