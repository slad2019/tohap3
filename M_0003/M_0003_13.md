**A:**  The <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. ཇ་མ] The monk(s) in charge of a monastery&#x27;s kitchen.">jama</span> would over see it and put the tea brick in the big cauldron and boil it. They would cut the butter into small pieces and they would make the monks to cut the butter.

**A:**  Usually, the <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. ཇ་མ] The monk(s) in charge of a monastery&#x27;s kitchen.">jama</span> would cut the butter and if there were other people around the jama and if the jama ask them to cut the butter, they would cut the butter for the jama.

**A:**  Yes, there were 30 monks as the member of the <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. ཁང་ཚན] A monastic residential unit in which monks from specific geographic areas lived.

**Q:**  Did the <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. ཇ་མ] The monk(s) in charge of a monastery&#x27;s kitchen.">jama</span> have to smash the tea [Tib. ཇ་གད]?   

**A:**  They didn't need to smash the tea too much because the sponsor would bring smashed 2-3 packages of four tea bricks. If the tea should be smashed, we have to smash it as we have many people. The tea leaves should be soaked earlier in the cauldron.   

**Q:**  They also have the responsibility for putting the right amount of water for the tea and the butter, right?   

**A:**  The water for the tea would be controlled by the <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. ཇ་མ] The monk(s) in charge of a monastery&#x27;s kitchen.">jama</span>. There were few <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. ཐབ་གཡོག] Monks or laymen who work as servants/manual laborers in kitchens (normally monastic kitchens).">thabyog</span>. There was a rule when they served the tea in the assembly. Sometimes, they have to serve one cup of tea for each monk and sometimes 2-3 cups should be served. Usually, as for the thabyog, they would try to put some more water because if there were tea left over, the thabyog would carry them in buckets to Thamba to their homes. Therefore, when they were making the tea the jama has to control the amount of water because the thabyog might make a light tea for the assembly and take away a lot of left over. It would not be okay if the thabyog didn't get any left over tea to take home, because the thabyog didn't have any wages. They were obliged to fetch water as a tax. That's how it is.   

**Q:**  The <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. ཇ་མ] The monk(s) in charge of a monastery&#x27;s kitchen.">jama</span> would get the alms called thondabarsum, [Tib. ཐོག་མཐའ་བར་གསུམ] where they go to ask for alms shares to the beginning, middle and the end of the lines when the monks were standing in line to get the alms.

**Q:**  The <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. ཇ་མ] The monk(s) in charge of a monastery&#x27;s kitchen.">jama</span> would take the alms for the 12 monks and deliver it to the monks, right?

**Q:**  Every year, one <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. ཕྱག་སྦུག] A manager (of estates and endowments) of a monastic college or monastic khamtsen.">chabu</span> have to go there, right?   

**A:**  Yes, they call it going to the north, Changdro [Tib. བྱང་འགྲོ]. This was kind of famous. When you reach your turn for the Changdro, you have to take capable servants because on the way there were many robbers and once you get robbed they would take away every thing. The main thing was the monk who go to Changdro had to hire a clerk and altogether there would be 5-6 people. I went as the Changdro for 6 years.   

**Q:**  Oh really?   

**A:**  Yes.   

**Q:**  Tell us about going for the Changdro?   

**A:**  Since I left for the Changdro until I come back, the <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. གྲྭ་ཚང] A &quot;college&quot; within a monastery, for example, in Drepung Monastery there were four main tratsang: Gomang, Loseling, Deyang and Ngagpa.

**A:**  Yes, but it won't take a year and it would take only 2 months.   

**Q:**  When did you have to go? Was it in summer?   

**A:**  Yes, we have to leave on the 3rd-4th of 7th lunar month and come back on the 20th of the 8th lunar month. I was hired as a clerk of the Changdro. So during that time, the Changdro would give me the food.

**Q:**  So how did they collect the tax?

It is difficult for them to think about the well being of the majority monks. Each and every animals had a brand on animals horn called radam [Tib. རྭ་དམ]. If animals died, then they have to show the horn. Even though they show the horn there won't be the brand on the horn which was branded in the previous year. So they would sell the animals and they would slaughter the animals and eat them and they would just show one horn. The changpa miser wouldn't adhere to the karmic law of cause and effect [Tib. ལས་རྒྱུ་འབྲས]. The böpa miser wouldn't do like this.   

**Q:**  They would slaughter the animals and they would say the animals died, right?   

**A:**  Yes, they would show the horn, but that was not the real horn. If that was a real horn, then they can say that animal died. They were not allowed to sell the animals. They would just one horn give a little money for the meat and leather of the dead animals. Actually, an animal cost 300-400-600-700. When they showed the horn, we just have to write off the animal in the list.   

**Q:**  This is about the lease, <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. 1. ཤས, 2. ཤེ] 1. A type of lease for agricultural land wherein the leasee pays half of the yield to the lessor. 2.

**A:**  Yes. As I said they had a good income who goes for the Changdro because they would get the Jelshu gift twice. That was the main income for the Changdro.

This was called Phebjal [Tib. ཕེབས་མཇལ] And the Changdro have to supply tea, <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. 1. ཆང, 2. བྱང] 1. Tibetan locally brewed barley beer. 2.

**Q:**  How much grain salary did you get in a year?   

**A:**  In the past, when I just joined the monastery, there was only one <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. ཁལ] A traditional volume measurement used for measuring grain in traditional Tibetan society. Sizes of this unit varied somewhat, but the official government khe (called mkhar ru or bstan dzin mkha ru) weighed about 28-31 pounds for barley. It was used to convey the size of fields. For example, a field said to be 10 khe in size meant that 10 khe of seed could be sown on that field.">khe</span> of grain. Later, it went up to two khe of grain.

For example, a field said to be 10 khe in size meant that 10 khe of seed could be sown on that field.">khe</span> of grain for the salary?   

**A:**  I don't remember very well but I think it was 10 years ago. There were many <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. གཞིས་ཀ] A manorial estate.">shiga</span> in villages which were leased very cheap and later they increased the lease because of the capable <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. ཕྱག་སྦུག] A manager (of estates and endowments) of a monastic college or monastic khamtsen.">chabu</span> who knows how to do things.

For example, a field said to be 10 khe in size meant that 10 khe of seed could be sown on that field.">khe</span> of grain? Was that after the Chinese came or before that?   

**A:**  That was before Chinese came to Tibet. Since Chinese came monks, they didn't get the chance to increase the salary because, the Chinese won't think about the monk's salary.   

**Q:**  Just before the revolt, the ordinary monks filed a law case saying, there were many grain in the monastery and the grain should be given to the monks for the salary and also they need to audit the accounts. So they came to the Branch Judicial System where Civil Disputes are settled, Gyöshib Lekhung [Tib. གྱོད་ཞིབ་ལས་ཁུངས] to do the audit, was that right?   

**A:**  I am telling you the truth. The law case of the monks were not that certain. No matter how much grain they have in the store, they have to give the grain for the salary in every year. The <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. གྲྭ་ཚང] A &quot;college&quot; within a monastery, for example, in Drepung Monastery there were four main tratsang: Gomang, Loseling, Deyang and Ngagpa.

There was a big house called granary which had two stories and they would fill it with grain in both stories. There was a hole in the second story and when the grain is finished they would take out the grain from the hole. The case was not only about that. There were also many matters beside that. The law case was based on the Nyen Shiga in Tölung and we got that Shiga through the law case. I think this was about the difference between the <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. དཔེ་ཆ་བ] A monk studying the monastic philosophical curriculum.

The law case was very well known and the <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. སྒོ་མང] One of the large colleges in Drepung Monastery.">Gomang</span> Tratsang got the first audit from the Gyöshib Lekhung.   

**Q:**  Was Gyöshib set up just before the <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. སྒོ་མང] One of the large colleges in Drepung Monastery.">Gomang</span> Tratsang applied the law case?   

**A:**  Just, before we applied the law case, Gyöshib Lekhung was set up. They did the audit for many days and the monks who were in charge of this matter, didn't have to face any trouble. The monks who filed the case didn't fully understand what was the real matter and they just talked recklessly. It would be difficult for the monks to talk deeply about the case.

**Q:**  I heard that lot of people didn't want to be the <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. དགེ་སྐོས] The main disciplinary official in a monastic college (tratsang).">gegö</span> because if they do the gegö, they have to suffer the loss from having to supply the tonggo. So the abbots have to insist the monks to be the gegö, is that right?

There were two kinds of <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. དགེ་སྐོས] The main disciplinary official in a monastic college (tratsang).">gegö</span>; one is the winter gegö and the other is the summer gegö. In winter, the gegö should be done by the <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. དགེ་ཤེས] An advanced degree earned by scholar monks.">geshe</span> because there was a good assembly tea and alms.

**Q:**  In winter, the monks want to do the <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. དགེ་སྐོས] The main disciplinary official in a monastic college (tratsang).">gegö</span> because there was a good <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. གཏོང་སྒོ] A monastic obligation to provide the food and other necessary items served at a monastic prayer assembly meeting or some other rite; this was often a required obligation for monastic officials at the end of their term of office.">tonggo</span>, right?

**Q:**  What about the summer <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. དགེ་སྐོས] The main disciplinary official in a monastic college (tratsang).">gegö</span>? The summer gegö would be at the time when there wasn't many <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. མང་ཇ] The morning tea served to monks from all the monastic colleges at the main prayer assembly hall.">mangja</span> and alms. So nobody want to do the gegö right?   

**A:**  Yes, in winter, there were good alms and tea and there were not many monks that the <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. དགེ་སྐོས] The main disciplinary official in a monastic college (tratsang).">gegö</span> need to pay the money in replacement of the rice gruel <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. ཐུག་པ] 1.

A porridge or gruel-like soup typically made with tsamba, and if available, meat and cheese. 2. Noodle dishes in broth.">thukpa</span> and on that did the gegö need to give the alms or not?

A porridge or gruel-like soup typically made with tsamba, and if available, meat and cheese. 2. Noodle dishes in broth.">thukpa</span>. In the past, they have to supply the thukpa and later when they have to supply the thukpa, it is expensive. So they paid the money in place of the thukpa.   

**Q:**  At the time of the shengo's candidate, there was competition to become the <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. དགེ་སྐོས] The main disciplinary official in a monastic college (tratsang).">gegö</span>, right?   

**A:**  Yes.   

**Q:**  What was the term for the shengo and the <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. དགེ་སྐོས] The main disciplinary official in a monastic college (tratsang).">gegö</span>?

**Q:**  How did they go for the candidate for the shengo?   

**A:**  If they would get the shengo's position that would be good. But if they didn't get it, they couldn't do anything. The winter <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. དགེ་སྐོས] The main disciplinary official in a monastic college (tratsang).">gegö</span> would start working from 15th of 5th lunar month to the 15th of 10th month. And the summer gegö would start working in 15th of 11th month to the 15th of the 4th month.   

**Q:**  The summer <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. དགེ་སྐོས] The main disciplinary official in a monastic college (tratsang).">gegö</span> won't get the chance to be the candidate of shengo every time, right?   

**A:**  Yes, that was because 4 <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. གྲྭ་ཚང] A &quot;college&quot; within a monastery, for example, in Drepung Monastery there were four main tratsang: Gomang, Loseling, Deyang and Ngagpa.

**Q:**  When they were making <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. མང་ཇ] The morning tea served to monks from all the monastic colleges at the main prayer assembly hall.">mangja</span>, one person from the Tashi Khangsar should come to watch when they make the tea, was that right?   

**A:**  Yes, when they were serving the <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. མང་ཇ] The morning tea served to monks from all the monastic colleges at the main prayer assembly hall.">mangja</span>, one person from the Tashi Khangsar should stand near the cauldron.   

**Q:**  The Depa himself wouldn't come when they serve the tea right?   

**A:**  He wouldn't come. But one of his representatives would come and he would supply the butter and those stuffs. The day before the <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. མང་ཇ] The morning tea served to monks from all the monastic colleges at the main prayer assembly hall.">mangja</span>, the people from Tashi Khangsar would gather together and weigh the butter in <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. ཉ་ག] A weight measurement unit. About 10 nyaga was equal to one gyama, which weighed 1.1 lbs.).">nyaga</span> [Tib. ཉ་ག] and put the tea leaf in the cauldron. There were many people who stand at the front of the cauldron when they serve the tea in the tsogchen. The following people would stand at the front of the cauldron; a person from Tashikhangsar, one person from <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. སྡེ་ཡངས] One of the colleges in Drepung Monastery.">Deyang</span> Tratsang called Deyang chatshül deba [Tib. ཇ་ཚུལ་བསྡེ་པ].   

**Q:**  What did chatshül deba do?   

**A:**  He just come and watch when they were making the tea. He won't go to the long distance and do kind of works.   

**Q:**  Did he make the arrangements for the tea server [Tib. ཨོ་ལོ] in the Mönlam?   

**A:**  No, there were two people known as <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. སྡེ་ཡངས] One of the colleges in Drepung Monastery.">Deyang</span> Deba [Tib. སྡེ་ཡངས་སྡེ་པ] would arrange the tea servers.   

**Q:**  So the two people from <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. སྡེ་ཡངས] One of the colleges in Drepung Monastery.">Deyang</span> would take care of serving <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. མང་ཇ] The morning tea served to monks from all the monastic colleges at the main prayer assembly hall.">mangja</span> right?   

**A:**  Yes, there were also two representatives of the two abbots and two tea makers, jama. These people should stand at the front of cauldron every morning.   

**Q:**  The two abbots means one from <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. བློ་གསལ་གླིང] One of the main colleges in Drepung Monastery.">Loseling</span> [Tib. བློ་གསལ་གླིང] and one from <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. སྒོ་མང] One of the large colleges in Drepung Monastery.">Gomang</span> right?   

**A:**  The abbots would take turns. The tea served in the assembly was a black tea with little bit grease on the surface.   

**Q:**  You mean to say the tea served in the <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. ཚོགས་ཆེན] The main assembly hall of a monastery. The assembly hall for the monastery as a whole.">tsogchen</span> has a little bit of grease, right?   

**A:**  Yes, only the <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. དགེ་ཤེས] An advanced degree earned by scholar monks.">geshe</span> and senior monks would get a little bit grease and newly joint the monks won't get much grease in the tea. Anyhow, there were 6 people who were looking after the tea each morning.   

**Q:**  What kind of relationship did the branch monastery of <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. སྒོ་མང] One of the large colleges in Drepung Monastery.">Gomang</span> [Tib. གཞིས་དགོན] have with the Gomang Tratsang? Some of them were saying that the abbots of the branch monastery would be appointed by the Gomang Tratsang. Some people were saying that the Branch Monastery would pay the tax to the Gomang Tratsang and the Gomang Tratsang wouldn't do any thing to the branch monastery, so what was the reality?   

**A:**  <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. སྒོ་མང] One of the large colleges in Drepung Monastery.">Gomang</span> Tratsang had less branch monasteries comparing with other tratsang. In the past, there were Champaling [Tib. བྱམས་པ་གླིང] Monastery in Lhoka area and there was a abbot in the monastery which belonged to Gomang Tratsang. Later, Labrang Kündeling [Tib. བླ་བྲང་ཀུན་བདེ་གླིང] kept the monastery.   

**Q:**  Labrang Kündeling took the Shiga as lease and they also kept the monastery, right?   

**A:**  Yes, therefore in the past, as you said that there were law case and the case was about the Champaling Monastery. They increased the salary of the monks. Before that, they just had about 2-3 yuan.   

**Q:**  How did they increase the salary? Did they increase the salary since they got the <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. གཞིས་ཀ] A manorial estate.">shiga</span> or how did they do it?   

**A:**  They kept the <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. གཞིས་ཀ] A manorial estate.">shiga</span> and they increased the lease and they paid a special salary. We couldn't handle Kündeling in the law case. <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. སྒོ་མང] One of the large colleges in Drepung Monastery.">Gomang</span> Tratsang would get good income from the monks who collect the donation and offering, Büdü [Tib. འབུལ་སྡུད]. The <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. གྲྭ་ཚང] A &quot;college&quot; within a monastery, for example, in Drepung Monastery there were four main tratsang: Gomang, Loseling, Deyang and Ngagpa. These tratsang were property owning corporate entities and included monks who were organized into residential dormitories called Khamtsen.">tratsang</span> would send Büdü to <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. ཨ་མདོ] One of the three main Tibetan sub-ethnic areas. It is located in the northeast of the Tibetan Plateau mostly in today&#x27;s Qinghai Province. A person from Amdo is called an Amdowa.">Amdo</span> [Tib. ཨམ་མདོ] and there were two sources of donations. One was Soktsang büdü [Tib. སོག་ཚང་འབུལ་སྡུད] and another one was Dzorge [Tib. ?] büdü. When the tratsang send the Büdü, they would send one Geshe or Lama with servants and the assistant monk in charge of offering [Tib. མཆོད་གཡོག]. When they come back, it was really helpful to the Gomang tratsang.   

**Q:**  You mean to say on income right?   

**A:**  Yes.   

**Q:**  There were many <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. གྲྭ་རྒྱུན] Monks who came to Drepung, Ganden and Sera from far distances such as Kham and Amdo.">tragyün</span> who came from the monasteries in the long distance, from <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. ཨ་མདོ] One of the three main Tibetan sub-ethnic areas. It is located in the northeast of the Tibetan Plateau mostly in today&#x27;s Qinghai Province. A person from Amdo is called an Amdowa.">Amdo</span> and Kham and those were like the branch monasteries, right?   

**A:**  Yes, they were kind of belonged to the tratsang.   

**Q:**  So what kind of relationship did they have between the branch monastery and the main monastery?   

**A:**  I don't know about that. There were many well known and holy <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. ཨ་མདོ] One of the three main Tibetan sub-ethnic areas. It is located in the northeast of the Tibetan Plateau mostly in today&#x27;s Qinghai Province. A person from Amdo is called an Amdowa.">Amdo</span> Lamas in <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. སྒོ་མང] One of the large colleges in Drepung Monastery.">Gomang</span> Tratsang. But they didn't have any sources [like monastery]. There was a monastery in Kongpo [Tib. ཀོང་པོ] called Tashi Rabten [Tib. བཀྲ་བཤིས་རབ་བརྟན] which was a small monastery. The monastery had little miser. From Drepung Monastery, they would send a monk called Tashi Rabten Depa [Tib. སྡེ་པ] to that monastery. The Deba would stay in Tashi Rabten for few years and when he would come back he would offer little amount of butter as the income he got from the animals. There wasn't any fix income from Amdo which is written in the books.   

**Q:**  There were Branch Monasteries in <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. ཨ་མདོ] One of the three main Tibetan sub-ethnic areas. It is located in the northeast of the Tibetan Plateau mostly in today&#x27;s Qinghai Province. A person from Amdo is called an Amdowa.">Amdo</span> and Lithang [Tib. ལི་ཐང] and other places, right?   

**A:**  Yes, there were branch monasteries.   

**Q:**  So we know that there wasn't any financial relation between the branch monastery and the <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. སྒོ་མང] One of the large colleges in Drepung Monastery.">Gomang</span> Tratsang. The monks would come to Gomang Tratsang and they would say that our monastery was the branch monastery of the Gomang Tratsang. So what was the reason to become the branch monastery of the Gomang Tratsang?   

**A:**  Probably, this was because the branch monasteries were belonged to <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. སྒོ་མང] One of the large colleges in Drepung Monastery.">Gomang</span> Tratsang from the ancient times [Tib. ཐོབ་ཁུངས]. The well known <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. ཨ་མདོ] One of the three main Tibetan sub-ethnic areas. It is located in the northeast of the Tibetan Plateau mostly in today&#x27;s Qinghai Province. A person from Amdo is called an Amdowa.">Amdo</span> Jayang Shepa [Tib. འཇམ་དབྱང་བཞད་པ] was belonged to Gomang Tratsang. In Lhasa there were the houses called Eastern Jayang, Jayang Shar [Tib. འཇམ་དབྱང་ཤར] and Midddle Jayang, Jayang kyil [Tib. འཇམ་དབྱང་སྐྱིལ ] and Western Jayang, Jayang Nub [Tib. འཇམ་དབྱང་ནུབ]. Jamyang Shepa offered all of these houses to the Gomang Tratsang and he also offered an Shiga in Kyarbo which could produce 1,000 <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. ཁལ] A traditional volume measurement used for measuring grain in traditional Tibetan society. Sizes of this unit varied somewhat, but the official government khe (called mkhar ru or bstan dzin mkha ru) weighed about 28-31 pounds for barley. It was used to convey the size of fields. For example, a field said to be 10 khe in size meant that 10 khe of seed could be sown on that field.">khe</span> of grain in a year for the Gomang Tratsang. Beside that, there wasn't anything that the Amdo offered to the tratsang.   

**Q:**  When did they begin the belonging system, Thobkhung?   

**A:**  I think that began in the early times of the Jekumbum [Tib. རྗེ་སྐུ་འབུམ] which was found by the Lama Tsongkhapa [Tib. ཙོང་ཁ་པ]. When the <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. ཨ་མདོ] One of the three main Tibetan sub-ethnic areas. It is located in the northeast of the Tibetan Plateau mostly in today&#x27;s Qinghai Province. A person from Amdo is called an Amdowa.">Amdo</span> came up, they would supply the <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. གཏོང་སྒོ] A monastic obligation to provide the food and other necessary items served at a monastic prayer assembly meeting or some other rite; this was often a required obligation for monastic officials at the end of their term of office.">tonggo</span> to the <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. སྒོ་མང] One of the large colleges in Drepung Monastery.">Gomang</span> Tratsang and make investment and offer <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. མང་ཇ] The morning tea served to monks from all the monastic colleges at the main prayer assembly hall.">mangja</span> and alms. The year before last year one Amdo Lama came to Gomang Tratsang and he said there aren't assembly mattresses and he offered the mattresses and he offered 1,000 <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. ཁལ] A traditional volume measurement used for measuring grain in traditional Tibetan society. Sizes of this unit varied somewhat, but the official government khe (called mkhar ru or bstan dzin mkha ru) weighed about 28-31 pounds for barley. It was used to convey the size of fields. For example, a field said to be 10 khe in size meant that 10 khe of seed could be sown on that field.">khe</span> of butter.   

**Q:**  Wow! When did he offer that? Was it recently?   

**A:**  It was just few years ago. That was at the time when Panchen Lama passed away. There was one <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. ཨ་མདོ] One of the three main Tibetan sub-ethnic areas. It is located in the northeast of the Tibetan Plateau mostly in today&#x27;s Qinghai Province. A person from Amdo is called an Amdowa.">Amdo</span> Lama called Gungthang Tenpe Drönme [Tib. གུང་ཐང་བསྟན་པའི་སྒྲོན་མེ] and he was from Amdo and his monastery is in Amdo and he is holy [Tib. རྩ་བ་ཆེན་པོ]. The main birth place of Gungthang Rinpoche is in Tselgung Thang [Tib. ཚལ་གུང་ཐང] [located at the east side of Lhasa]. He asked the people whether they could build the monastery in Tshelgung Thang or not. The people said they can't build the monastery. He told them that if you can build a monastery, I would help you. But, they were unable to build the monastery. And he asked them, "do you know what was my birth household?" They said they don't know. He was born in Tselgungthang. When Gungthang Rinpoche went to pilgrimage to Ganden he gave 1,000 <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. ཁལ] A traditional volume measurement used for measuring grain in traditional Tibetan society. Sizes of this unit varied somewhat, but the official government khe (called mkhar ru or bstan dzin mkha ru) weighed about 28-31 pounds for barley. It was used to convey the size of fields. For example, a field said to be 10 khe in size meant that 10 khe of seed could be sown on that field.">khe</span> of butter to the people who were living near the Ganden because there were poor. He said. "you people should divide the butter to all the people in the village equally regardless of age." When he came for the pilgrimage to <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. སྒོ་མང] One of the large colleges in Drepung Monastery.">Gomang</span> Tratsang, he saw that <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. གྲྭ་ཚང] A &quot;college&quot; within a monastery, for example, in Drepung Monastery there were four main tratsang: Gomang, Loseling, Deyang and Ngagpa. These tratsang were property owning corporate entities and included monks who were organized into residential dormitories called Khamtsen.">tratsang</span> didn't have the assembly mattress. So he told them to make the mattress and Gomang Tratsang made the mattress with felt covered with fine woolen material Shema [Tib. ཤད་མ] which is best quality woolen cloth. This was offered by the Amdo Lama Gungthang Tenpe Drönme.   

**Q:**  Nowadays, how many monks are there in Sera?   

**A:**  There are over 400 monks who were regularly admitted.   

**Q:**  So that was as same as Drepung?   

**A:**  Yes, it is same as Drepung. Most of the monks didn't have residence permit [Tib. ཐེམ་ཐོ]. There were 300-400 monks were yet to be admitted. There were many young monks who had already memorized <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. དཔེ་ཆ] Religious books/texts, scriptures.">pecha</span>, but yet to be admitted. Last time, the government's Work Team [Tib. ལས་དོན་རུ་ཁག] came to the monastery and said, "there is no discipline in the monastery and we would make the discipline and we would admit new monks but not too many. We have to report to the superior" They made a great deal on saying that. They said a lot about admitting monks to the monastery but they didn't admit a single monk. After that, the talk about admitting the monks is becoming more and more distant.   

**Q:**  What was the procedures for getting admitted in the <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. ཆོས་ར] The special grove (&quot;dharma grove&quot;) in monasteries where monks formally met to practice debating.">chöra</span> in Sera? In Drepung, if I say I want to get admitted in the chöra, it was not so easy. How about over here?   

**A:**  Here, you would get admitted. In Sera it is a good place to learn the <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. མཚན་ཉིད] Buddhist dialectics. This is taught after the six-year curriculum called düdra.">tsenyi</span> and when you got admitted, the <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. དགེ་རྒན] 1. Teacher in a school. 2. In monastic settings it also refers to an adult monk who acted as a guardian to a younger monk. In such cases, the younger monk typically lived in the gegen&#x27;s apartment (shag). In monasteries, however, it could also mean a real teacher, or the monk who served as the guarantor for a new monk.">gegen</span> would tell you that you should learn the tsenyi. But some of the young monks didn't behave well and wandered around. There was the Tantric ritual [Tib. སྔགས་ཆོག] which need to be memorized. The monks who were memorizing the Tantric ritual do not need to learn tsenyi. In Tibetan Buddhism is divided in two part one is Sutra [Tib. མདོ] which is tsenyi and the other is Tantra. So you can chose whatever you want to learn. If you didn't know the tsenyi then you can tell the leader [Tib. འགོ་ཁྲིད] that I want to learn the tantric ritual, they would agree with that.   

**Q:**  You have to join the <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. ཆོས་ར] The special grove (&quot;dharma grove&quot;) in monasteries where monks formally met to practice debating.">chöra</span> right?   

**A:**  If you got admitted you can join the <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. ཆོས་ར] The special grove (&quot;dharma grove&quot;) in monasteries where monks formally met to practice debating.">chöra</span>. Nowadays, even if you didn't get admitted in the chöra and if you want to debate on <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. མཚན་ཉིད] Buddhist dialectics. This is taught after the six-year curriculum called düdra.">tsenyi</span>, then you can tell the monastic official that I want to join the chöra and they would let you join it. The monks who join the chöra would get little bit wages according to the number of days they joined the chöra. The wages was not high it was just like almost little less than one <span class="tooltip" data-text="[ch. 元] China&#x27;s basic currency unit. A yuan is divided into 100 fen and 10 jiao. It is also known as renminbi or &quot;people&#x27;s currency.&quot;">yuan</span> or few fens. They would make notes everyday for the monks who came to the chöra. In the evening, when you go to receive the teaching from your <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. དགེ་རྒན] 1. Teacher in a school. 2. In monastic settings it also refers to an adult monk who acted as a guardian to a younger monk. In such cases, the younger monk typically lived in the gegen&#x27;s apartment (shag). In monasteries, however, it could also mean a real teacher, or the monk who served as the guarantor for a new monk.">gegen</span>, they would make the note. And they would pay the wages according to the note. If you don't have residential card, then you wouldn't get the wages even though you joined the chöra.   

**Q:**  To get the wages, do the monks have to be regularly admitted or do they have to have the residence permit?   

**A:**  If they didn't have the residence permit to show that they were nomarly admitted, then they would become very poor. There is a very strange system in Sera, if you go to the <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. ཆོས་ར] The special grove (&quot;dharma grove&quot;) in monasteries where monks formally met to practice debating.">chöra</span> or to receive teaching, they would differentiate the monks who have residence permit or not. Actually, they should treat them equally whether they have residence permit or not because the monks who didn't have residence permit are also studying the tsenyis. During the daytime, there are many monks who go to work and the wages would be paid according to the residence permit.   

**Q:**  The monks who have residence permit would get more wages?   

**A:**  Yes, that is very bad. The residence permit is to get the ration grain. The monks who have residence permit and the monks who didn't have residential when they go to work they would go together they would get off from the work at the same time. But, the monks who didn't have the resident card here would suffer a great loss when they differentiate the monks who have residence permit and who have not. We don't know what is the aim of the leader. We have the resident card, but I don't have a job.   

**Q:**  You are belonged to the Nursing Home [Tib. རྒས་གསོ་ཁང] right?   

**A:**  Yes.   

**Q:**  Nowadays, in Drepung they set up a new school and is there any hope that the system of the school would be as same as Sera?   

**A:**  Yes, there is the hope for that. They decided to set up a school. They were saying that they are going to admit new monks and they would give them resident card and they also said they would give the resident card to those who didn't have one. They said like that, but they didn't do it yet.   

**Q:**  Who promised that? Was it the Democratic Mangement Committee [Tib. ཨུ་ཡོན་ལྷན་ཁང] or the Work Team?   

**A:**  The Democratic Mangement Committee and Work team discussed together but the Work Team has the main power. Except 300-400 children got admitted, rest of them were all registered. The Work Team already made the registration and they said, "we are going to set up the school and any one can join the school. If you learn some thing it would help you in the future. If you don't want to come to school no one would call you to the school."   

**Q:**  Did they start the school?   

**A:**  Not yet. The Work Team said they are going to make many classes. In Drepung, they would teach <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. དཔེ་ཆ] Religious books/texts, scriptures.">pecha</span> in the morning and in the afternoon they would let them learn Tibetan writing and reading. I think in Sera, they are going to make classes like Tibetan, Chinese, English and tsenyi. They said they are going to make strict discipline and if you do well, then you would fulfill your parents and <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. དགེ་རྒན] 1. Teacher in a school. 2. In monastic settings it also refers to an adult monk who acted as a guardian to a younger monk. In such cases, the younger monk typically lived in the gegen&#x27;s apartment (shag). In monasteries, however, it could also mean a real teacher, or the monk who served as the guarantor for a new monk.">gegen</span>'s wishes and in the future you would be happy. Otherwise, if you just say that you want to be monk in the monastery and if you didn't study pecha or learn skill, it won't help you. They started registering ten days ago.   

**Q:**  In Drepung, the Work Team came and registered the young monks and they got admitted in school. The Work Team said it is not allowed to admit more new monks, is that right?   

**A:**  Yes, that's right.   

**Q:**  Did they say the same thing in sera?   

**A:**  At the beginning, they said like that. Now we don't know because they hadn't summerize [Tib. སྡོམ་རྒྱག] the number of students in the school. They will count how many students joined the school and then summerize it. They said the monk who didn't come to school or the monks who didn't get admitted in the monastery were not allowed to stay in the monastery. If they didn't get admitted in monastery then they can join the school. This is right, we really need discipline in the monastery.   

**Q:**  Do the monks need to pay the rent?   

**A:**  No, all the monks didn't need to pay the rant.   

**Q:**  If you get retired, do you need to pay the rant?   

**A:**  Yes, I think you have to pay a little. There were not many retired monks.   

**Q:**  For example, the monk who is not retired and he didn't get admitted in monastery and used to be monk and stay in Sera Monastery, did those monks need to pay the rent?   

**A:**  They were considered as retired. Anyhow, the monks who didn't belong to Sera, but if they just stayed in Sera, they would be considered as retired. I think they need to pay the rent. I am not so sure. If they have to pay the rent, it is not high.   

**Q:**  Did the Work Team ask you about monks opinion, right?   

**A:**  Yes.   

**Q:**  So what did the monks say?   

**A:**  It is hard for the monks to tell their real opinion. Some of the monks said, "in the past, there were many monks, but not now. So please let the monks join the monastery and give them the resident card. If they don't have the residence permit, it is hard for them to find the living. If they don't find the living, it is hard for them to practice Dharma [Tib. ཆོས]." Some of them were saying, "the monks didn't have good discipline and going to Lhasa and wearing pants and riding bicycle and the discipline is getting worse."   

**Q:**  Did the Democratic Mangement Committee have the power?   

**A:**  No, the Work Team had the power.   

**Q:**  When the monks were wearing laymen clothe and going every where in Lhasa, did the Democratic Mangement Committee have the power to stop them?   

**A:**  They were talking about that everyday. There are also <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. དགེ་སྐོས] The main disciplinary official in a monastic college (tratsang).">gegö</span> and he was saying that monks were not allowed to ride the bicycle and not allowed to go out to Lhasa. The monks were not allowed to go out late night and not allowed to drink <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. 1. ཆང, 2. བྱང] 1. Tibetan locally brewed barley beer. 2. North; nomad areas north of Lhasa in Nagchuga Prefecture 3. ch. 厂 factory.">chang</span>, smoke cigarette. But, those things were still happening like that.   

**Q:**  Were there any way to stop them?   

**A:**  That was because they couldn't make the discipline strict enough. It was not as same as in the past.   

**Q:**  If the monks were wearing laymen clothe and going to Lhasa with out getting permission, what if the monk got fired from association Kyidug [Tib. སྐྱིད་སྡུག]?   

**A:**  It is okay to fire the monks. The Democratic Mangement Committee and Work Team would scold the <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. དགེ་རྒན] 1. Teacher in a school. 2. In monastic settings it also refers to an adult monk who acted as a guardian to a younger monk. In such cases, the younger monk typically lived in the gegen&#x27;s apartment (shag). In monasteries, however, it could also mean a real teacher, or the monk who served as the guarantor for a new monk.">gegen</span> very much saying, "you people have many <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. དགེ་ཕྲུག] 1. Student. 2. Disciple. 3. Commonly the name for monks living with a gegen or teacher. These are more like wards than real disciples.">gidru</span> whether your parents told you to keep them or your relatives told you to keep them, or you kept the gidru because you are getting many things to eat. Anyway, why didn't you control your gidru. When you keep your gidru you have to know how to control the gidru. Some of the gegens didn't even know where the students have been. If you gegen didn't control the gidru then the Work Team and Democratic Mangement Committee would call you." These things happened because in general, they didn't have good discipline. In the past, at the time of 9200 monks in Sera Jei and Sera Mai [Tib. བྱེས་སྨད], all the monks were under the Tsogchen Shengo.   

**Q:**  In the past, they could whip them right?   

**A:**  In the past I swear they would decide the things by beating them up with switches.   

**Q:**  Nowadays, is it not allowed to beat the monks with switches?   

**A:**  No, it is not allowed to. And not allowed to fine them. In the past, they would fine them and they would beat them in the assembly and they make the person lay down and beat them with switches. Anyhow, in the past all the monks were controlled under two people. [the shengo] Nowadays there is no discipline. So they couldn't control the monks. If all the leaders [Tib. འགོ་ཁྲིད] have solidarity and steadfast that would be good but sometimes they were like that and sometime were not like that. The members of the Democratic Mangement Committee are monks and the director [Ch. zhu ren] is a lay man. They would discuss all the matters when they met together. The director is the most powerful one.   

**Q:**  Nowadays, who is the most powerful one?   

**A:**  The <span class="tooltip" data-text="[ch. 主任] Director of a unit or office.">zhuren</span> is most powerful who is a lay man.   

**Q:**  Is that the lame person?   

**A:**  Yes.   

**Q:**  Did Drepung have the same opinion?   

**A:**  In Drepung, they already set up the school and the student were studying <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. མཚན་ཉིད] Buddhist dialectics. This is taught after the six-year curriculum called düdra.">tsenyi</span> and writing and reading. The student were not allowed to go to school wearing laymen clothes. You have to wear the monks robe. That is the best. If they didn't allow to happen these things in the monastery, then they won't go every where. All of the monks were not like that. Just a few monks were not good. Most of the monks were good and they were studying <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. དཔེ་ཆ] Religious books/texts, scriptures.">pecha</span> really hard. The monks who go to work they would work hard. Nowadays in the park there are 20 monks working in the park. They told the monks who were working in the park, "if you work hard in the park, later even if couldn't pass the exam, we would let you in the monastery." But no one knows what would the Work Team say in the future. You have to memorize 300 pages of pecha and take the test in order to get admitted. Last year and in the year before last year, even when they couldn't memorize 3-4 pages, they returned them back.   

**Q:**  Some of the monks in Drepung have the opinion that the <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. དགེ་རྒན] 1. Teacher in a school. 2.

When they became 15-16 years old, they went to join the demonstration to shout slogan in Lhasa. So some of them got arrested and some of them escaped to India. So the gegen kept some new gidru and they would study and later they also joined the demonstration. Therefore, the gegen were disheartened. Is there the same situation here?   

**A:**  Yes, it is something like that.   

**Q:**  All the <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. དཔེ་ཆ་བ] A monk studying the monastic philosophical curriculum. A scholar monk.">pechawa</span> went to join the demonstration, right?   

**A:**  Few of them went. Depung had more pechawa.   

**Q:**  I was told that the monks who join the demonstration were best <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. དཔེ་ཆ་བ] A monk studying the monastic philosophical curriculum. A scholar monk.">pechawa</span>, right?   

**A:**  Yes, they were good in <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. དཔེ་ཆ] Religious books/texts, scriptures.">pecha</span> and chanting prayers. [Tib. འདོན་ཆ]. At the beginning of the demonstration many monks from Sera jointed it. Last year, and in this year there were not many monks from Sera who joined the demonstration. Even now, there are quite a lot of monks in the jail. The Work Team came and they were mainly talking to the <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. དགེ་རྒན] 1. Teacher in a school. 2. In monastic settings it also refers to an adult monk who acted as a guardian to a younger monk. In such cases, the younger monk typically lived in the gegen&#x27;s apartment (shag). In monasteries, however, it could also mean a real teacher, or the monk who served as the guarantor for a new monk.">gegen</span> and they told the monks not to joint the disturbances. This is the principle.

**A:**  I don't think the <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. དགེ་རྒན] 1. Teacher in a school. 2. In monastic settings it also refers to an adult monk who acted as a guardian to a younger monk. In such cases, the younger monk typically lived in the gegen&#x27;s apartment (shag).

Nowadays, the reason why they think it is better not to join the demonstration, is because in the jail they would get seriously beaten and they would get beaten until they are almost dead. Therefore, the monks were thinking that it is not worthy to join the demonstration.   

**Q:**  Did the Work Team say that if the monks didn't join the demonstration, then they would get more new monks admitted and they would spend more expense?   

**A:**  The Work Team was saying something like that. They didn't say that say if you don't join the demonstration, they would have the monks admitted. They just said, "it is useless for the monks to join the demonstration. In the old society, Sera and the <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. སྡེ་བ་གཞུང] The name of the traditional Tibetan government.">dewashung</span> had a war. At that time, monks of Sera didn't stay still, although the dewashung didn't have the power, but they destroyed the Sera Monastery and many people died and many of them were fired from monastery. Don't you people know about that? If you didn't know about the situation between dewashung and Sera, now the Chinese Government is very powerful, so you cannot raise your hands and over throw it." Actually, the meaning is different, but they are talking like that because they have the power. If we get the independent, we are not saying that we want the whole China. We are not saying that we want to overthrow China. If we gain the independence, it would be beneficial for the Buddhism and also for all sentient beings. More over, we could invite the Dalai Lama [back to Tibet].
