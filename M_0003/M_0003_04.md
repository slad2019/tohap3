**Q:**  We have heard from some people that the reason for the dispute between <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. བླ་རྒྱུད་པ] A term for the common monks in a monastery (in contrast to the scholar monks who were actively studying the Buddhist doctrine).">lagyüba</a> and <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. དཔེ་ཆ་བ] A monk studying the monastic philosophical curriculum. A scholar monk.">pechawa</a> was that they were saying that the pechawa who go to <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. འཇང་དགུན་ཆོས] The special winter debating session for monks that was held annually in the area called Jang.">Jang günchö</a> had a very hard condition, so they need to have a special right [Tib. དམིགས་བསལ་ཐོབ་ཐང] Is this true? if not, there might be other affairs [Tib. གནས་ཚུལ]. Please explain how did it happen.   

**A:**  This was their internal affair. There was nothing to do with the reason for the cause of the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. སྒོ་མང] One of the large colleges in Drepung Monastery.">Gomang</a> Tratsang's case. The cause of it as I said earlier was the attempt to change the location of where salary was paid and it was with regards to the discipline and not to have the good old system get declined [Tib. སྔ་སྲོལ་བཟང་པོ་ཉམས་པ]. At that time, the case was not between the two parties; <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. དཔེ་ཆ་བ] A monk studying the monastic philosophical curriculum. A scholar monk.">pechawa</a> and the lagyüba. It was a general case regarding the two places; <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. སྒོ་མཆོར] The area outside of the monastic assembly hall that is supported by tall pillars.">gomchor</a> [Tib. སྒོ་མཆོར] and the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཆོས་ར] The special grove (&quot;dharma grove&quot;) in monasteries where monks formally met to practice debating.">chöra</a> where the salary should be paid. The reason for paying the salary in the gomchor was because there were many monks with special privileges. These with special privileges could ask for a permission from the new abbot during his 6 years term (they have to only ask once) and from each <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. དགེ་སྐོས] The main disciplinary official in a monastic college (tratsang).">gegö</a> during his 6 months term.   

**Q:**  Please explain clearly how they ask for the permission from the abbot. Could they ask for the permission during 6 years abbot or what?   

**A:**  There were many different types of monks who could ask this permission. One of these were <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. སྡེ་བ་གཞུང] The name of the traditional Tibetan government.">dewashung</a> kudrak and those who have the special privilage who would ask the permission to not have to come to the regular <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཚོགས] 1. A prayer assembly meeting in monasteries when all the monks come to an assembly hall and chant prayers together. 2. An offering made of tsamba, butter and dry cheese in the shape of a cone.">tsog</a> or <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཆོས་ར] The special grove (&quot;dharma grove&quot;) in monasteries where monks formally met to practice debating.">chöra</a> except the special tsog. I will tell you who were the people having special privilage; first is all the enchöndze and the second is the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. དགེ་ཤེས] An advanced degree earned by scholar monks.">geshe</a> who have passed their exams [Tib. དགེ་བཤེས་མཚན་རྟགས་ཐོན་ཟིན]. From the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. བླ་རྒྱུད་པ] A term for the common monks in a monastery (in contrast to the scholar monks who were actively studying the Buddhist doctrine).">lagyüba</a> who don't know <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. མཚན་ཉིད] Buddhist dialectics. This is taught after the six-year curriculum called düdra.">tsenyi</a>, there are the trebön treyog [Tib. གྲལ་དཔོན་གྲལ་གཡོག], these are the 2 senior lagyüba who sit at the head of two rows. Then all the main people who are working in the 16 <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཁང་ཚན] A monastic residential unit in which monks from specific geographic areas lived. These were corporate entities with property and internal officials. Some large khamtsen had smaller subordinate units called mi tshan. Khamtsen were part of tratsang (colleges). For example, Hamdong Khamtsen was part of Gomang College in Drepung Monastery.">khamtsen</a>. In the biggest khamtsen such as Samlo they might have about 20 people and in Hamdong it might involve 25 monks. And in some smaller khamtsen, there might be only 4-5 monks. Khamtsen <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. དགེ་རྒན] 1. Teacher in a school. 2. In monastic settings it also refers to an adult monk who acted as a guardian to a younger monk. In such cases, the younger monk typically lived in the gegen&#x27;s apartment (shag). In monasteries, however, it could also mean a real teacher, or the monk who served as the guarantor for a new monk.">gegen</a> and <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. མི་ཚན] A sub-unit of a khamtsen.">mitsen</a> nyerba have special privileges. Then there are the monks who were called Rakhor Genpa [Tib. ར་འཁོར་རྒན་པ] who look after and do the cleaning in the jikhang of the khamtsen. These above mentioned monks were the ones who ask for the permission.   

**Q:**  To whom did they have to ask for the permission?   

**A:**  They could ask the new abbot only once during his 6 years terms by giving 2 <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཞོ] A unit in the traditional Tibetan currency system. 10 sho equaled to 1 sang and 10 karma equaled one sho.">sho</a> of money to the abbot and the one <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. སྐར་མ] 1. The smallest currency unit (a copper coin) in the traditional Tibetan currency system. Ten karma equaled 1 sho. 2. A work point in post-1959 Tibet. 3. A person&#x27;s name.">karma</a> to the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. གྲྭ་ཚང] A &quot;college&quot; within a monastery, for example, in Drepung Monastery there were four main tratsang: Gomang, Loseling, Deyang and Ngagpa. These tratsang were property owning corporate entities and included monks who were organized into residential dormitories called Khamtsen.">tratsang</a> <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. དགེ་སྐོས] The main disciplinary official in a monastic college (tratsang).">gegö</a> to ask the permission only during his 6 months term. This was the main old custom which also happened just we became the monk and they paid the salary under the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. སྒོ་མཆོར] The area outside of the monastic assembly hall that is supported by tall pillars.">gomchor</a>. In the very early times, they might not have that. When there is alms in the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཚོགས] 1. A prayer assembly meeting in monasteries when all the monks come to an assembly hall and chant prayers together. 2. An offering made of tsamba, butter and dry cheese in the shape of a cone.">tsog</a>, they have to give alot of alms shares and they also serve the mangja. When the salary is going to paid on the next, the monks who have the special privilage would ask for the permission and which would be grantd and then they go to get the salary. If the salary is not paid in the gomchor, the above mentioned monks who have the special privilage to ask the permission will get harmed [Tib. སྐྱོན]. As for how they get harmed, if I tell you in detail, when the salary is given in the gomchor, the names are read out of each monks according to the seniority. So the monks working in the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཁང་ཚན] A monastic residential unit in which monks from specific geographic areas lived. These were corporate entities with property and internal officials. Some large khamtsen had smaller subordinate units called mi tshan. Khamtsen were part of tratsang (colleges). For example, Hamdong Khamtsen was part of Gomang College in Drepung Monastery.">khamtsen</a> etc would not need to lock the door and go to get the salary at once, but they could go according to the senioriry. If the salary is given in the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཆོས་ར] The special grove (&quot;dharma grove&quot;) in monasteries where monks formally met to practice debating.">chöra</a>, nobody would have the privilage and asking the abbot for permission also becomes useless. That's why, they were it is not okay. The gegö and umdze sit there maybe with another and they read the all the names of the monks one after another.   

**Q:**  The monks who have the special privilage would not need to wait for the salary, right?   

**A:**  The privileged ones don't have to come in person and when they read the names, they would read their names and say that they have the extra shares and they can send someone to collect it on behalf of them. otherwise they too will lose that day's salary. And the monks with less high privileges such as the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. དགེ་ཤེས] An advanced degree earned by scholar monks.">geshe</a> and other <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཁང་ཚན] A monastic residential unit in which monks from specific geographic areas lived. These were corporate entities with property and internal officials. Some large khamtsen had smaller subordinate units called mi tshan. Khamtsen were part of tratsang (colleges). For example, Hamdong Khamtsen was part of Gomang College in Drepung Monastery.">khamtsen</a> workers will be given their salary when they come and they can go back as soon as get the salary. They don't have to wait there for a long time. They get it at once. But when the salary is given in the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཆོས་ར] The special grove (&quot;dharma grove&quot;) in monasteries where monks formally met to practice debating.">chöra</a>. They have to wait until the chöra is finished to then get the salary, and in the process must set aside whatever work they were engaged in such as performing rituals, watchmen of jikhang etc. That's how the case started because the old custom was declined.   

**Q:**  How would they give the alms?   

**A:**  The alms is different. It is given in the Dukhang together with tea and they beat gong from the roof. There are all sorts of extra shares in alms and the amount needed to do alms is much more for the same number of monks even it is one tranka. With salary, you only get your share, no extras. In the salary, first the senior monks and the ones with privilege get their salary as their names are read off.   

**Q:**  There was no name list for the common monks, right? Do they have to go in line?   

**A:**  The names of the common monks are also on a list but they would not read it every time and they can get the salary right away by going in line according to the seniority whether the name is read one by one or not. But if they go to the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཆོས་ར] The special grove (&quot;dharma grove&quot;) in monasteries where monks formally met to practice debating.">chöra</a>, it takes a very long time. In <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. སྒོ་མང] One of the large colleges in Drepung Monastery.">Gomang</a> Tratsang, when they would give the grain salary, names of the all the monks regardless of senior and junior are read off one by one and then they have to go one by one and get their share. They were thinking that some one would take double shares. At first, the names of the privileged ones are read off and their replacement [Tib. ཚབ] would take it. After the names of the privileged ones are read off, then the common monks come.   

**Q:**  If the privileged ones didn't send their replacements, what would happened?   

**A:**  They would suffer the loss and wouldn't get the salary.   

**Q:**  Would they read the names when they give the alms?   

**A:**  For alms, there is no reading of name list. Alms are given while the monks are seated in the dukhang.   

**Q:**  Then what about ones who come to get the shares, <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. སྐལ་ལེན] A special right allowing certain monks to take their share of alms outside of the prayer assembly hall. This privilege meant they did not have to attend the prayer session to get their alms.">kelen</a> [Tib. སྐལ་ལེན]?   

**A:**  These people don't go into the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཚོགས] 1. A prayer assembly meeting in monasteries when all the monks come to an assembly hall and chant prayers together. 2. An offering made of tsamba, butter and dry cheese in the shape of a cone.">tsog</a>, The <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. སྐལ་ལེན] A special right allowing certain monks to take their share of alms outside of the prayer assembly hall. This privilege meant they did not have to attend the prayer session to get their alms.">kelen</a> just come to get alms at the courtyard of the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. འདུ་ཁང] An assembly hall in a monastery.">dukhang</a> and then leave.   

**Q:**  Wouldn't they try to get double shares?   

**A:**  There is no way to sneak around for a second alms since they would exit by the east or the west door from where the alms in given. There is no sneaking around since they start only when all the monks are there and then no more can enter the courtyard. Kelen is the same in <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཚོགས་ཆེན] The main assembly hall of a monastery. The assembly hall for the monastery as a whole.">tsogchen</a> and in tratsang. When the monks stand on line to get the alms, sharkag [Tib. བཤར་བཀག], if a monk is too late to stand on the line, he is not allowed to stretch his hand to get the alms because he is too late.   

**Q:**  What is the difference between alms and salary? When they give the salary there is no <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. མང་ཇ] The morning tea served to monks from all the monastic colleges at the main prayer assembly hall.">mangja</a>, right?   

**A:**  Yes.   

**Q:**  Mostly, the salary is money, right?   

**A:**  Yes.   

**Q:**  What is the difference between alms and salary?   

**A:**  There is a great difference between alms and salary. When they give alms, the monks would assemble and they serve tea, they offer butter lamps and <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཁ་བཏགས] A Tibetan ceremonial scarf given to lamas, visitors, etc.">khata</a>, [Tib. སྙན་ཤལ] to the deities and they also submit the request for the reciting prayers, kyabtho [Tib. སྐྱབས་ཐོ] but also there were many extra shares for the monks. In salary, there are no extra shares. Between the salary and the alms, the monks get the same amount, but there is a big difference for the sponsors in spending their money. For the alms, they spend alot of money because there were many extra shares for the privilaged ones. Salary is simple, one just sits under the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. སྒོ་མཆོར] The area outside of the monastic assembly hall that is supported by tall pillars.">gomchor</a> and hands it out, doesn't have to worry about tea and offerings etc.   

**Q:**  In salary are there few people with special privileges?   

**A:**  Yes. In <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. སྒོ་མང] One of the large colleges in Drepung Monastery.">Gomang</a>, these would be the abbot, 4 <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. གྲྭ་ཚང] A &quot;college&quot; within a monastery, for example, in Drepung Monastery there were four main tratsang: Gomang, Loseling, Deyang and Ngagpa. These tratsang were property owning corporate entities and included monks who were organized into residential dormitories called Khamtsen.">tratsang</a> chabu, 1 <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. བླ་བྲང] 1. The property/wealth owning corporate entity of an incarnate lama. 2. The property/wealth owning corporate entity of the Panchen Lama.">labrang</a> chandzö, 1 clerk, <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. དགེ་སྐོས] The main disciplinary official in a monastic college (tratsang).">gegö</a>, umdze and there were many working in the tratsang. These people get extra shares in the alms like some get 2 shares and some even get 6-7- or 10 some.   

**Q:**  Who decides whether the money goes as alms or salary?   

**A:**  When a sponsor gives money, it is up to him whether to give it as alms or as salary. When they say they are going to give alms, they would have to serve tea etc on the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཚོགས] 1. A prayer assembly meeting in monasteries when all the monks come to an assembly hall and chant prayers together. 2. An offering made of tsamba, butter and dry cheese in the shape of a cone.">tsog</a> as I mentioned above. And the sponsor would go around the tsog carrying incense. But they don't need to do that for the salary and they just sit on a stone step and when they read the names, they give the money and that's it.   

**Q:**  Do you have to leave the endowments [Tib. མ་རྩ] for both the salary and the alms?   

**A:**  You leave the endowments for the salary, for alms you don't give endowments. They leave many endowments for the salary to the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. གྲྭ་ཚང] A &quot;college&quot; within a monastery, for example, in Drepung Monastery there were four main tratsang: Gomang, Loseling, Deyang and Ngagpa. These tratsang were property owning corporate entities and included monks who were organized into residential dormitories called Khamtsen.">tratsang</a> chabu, the 2 joint cashiers and the 4 joint cashiers. This is like the proverb, "using the root as the capital and using the leaves for making offerings [Tib. རྩ་བས་རྩ་བྱས། ལོ་མས་མཆོད་པ་འབུལ] they use the interest grain and money loans for salary. If somebody leave an endowment for alms, they would not give it in the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཚོགས] 1. A prayer assembly meeting in monasteries when all the monks come to an assembly hall and chant prayers together. 2. An offering made of tsamba, butter and dry cheese in the shape of a cone.">tsog</a> but they would give it outside and there was also endowments for the rice gruel [Tib. ཐུག་པ་དམ་བཅའ]. During the times I remembered, there weren't many of these. There was just 1-2 persons who left this kind of endowment.   

**Q:**  Who is he?   

**A:**  He was Jiso Tagkharel [Tib. སྟག་ཁ་རལ].   

**Q:**  Mostly, do the sponsors give alms by themselves or they do it through the laji etc ?   

**A:**  The sponsors give alms by themselves. But some of the endowments left for giving the salary on holy days was given on the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཚོགས] 1. A prayer assembly meeting in monasteries when all the monks come to an assembly hall and chant prayers together. 2. An offering made of tsamba, butter and dry cheese in the shape of a cone.">tsog</a> also, but they would not give extra shares.   

**Q:**  The <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. སྤྱི་བསོ] The head managers/stewards of monasteries as a whole, especially the large Gelugpa monasteries like Sera and Drepung.">jiso</a> had many <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. གཞིས་ཀ] A manorial estate.">shiga</a> and they give <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. མང་ཇ] The morning tea served to monks from all the monastic colleges at the main prayer assembly hall.">mangja</a> and those things, but would they give alms?   

**A:**  Yes. They had to give money many times to the monks and they also give grain and butter to the monks. In Drepung, there was no one who had to give more <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. གཏོང་སྒོ] A monastic obligation to provide the food and other necessary items served at a monastic prayer assembly meeting or some other rite; this was often a required obligation for monastic officials at the end of their term of office.">tonggo</a> than the jiso. Jiso collects grain from many <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. མི་སེར] A term that can mean serf/bound subject as well as citizen, depending on context. For example, the miser of a lord would connote the bound subjects of that lord, whereas the miser of Tibet would connote citizens of Tibet.">miser</a> and they leave the endowments to the miser and use them for the monks.   

**Q:**  Is the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. སྤྱི་བསོ] The head managers/stewards of monasteries as a whole, especially the large Gelugpa monasteries like Sera and Drepung.">jiso</a>'s money called alms or salary.   

**A:**  It's all called salary.   

**Q:**  It is hard to know about the customs that we haven't seen it. Was there a trouble regarding <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. འཇང་དགུན་ཆོས] The special winter debating session for monks that was held annually in the area called Jang.">Jang günchö</a>?   

**Q:**  Regarding our law case and when we talk internally, there was no trouble about that. But, I don't know whether they had talkled about this when they reported to the higher ups [Tib. གོང་རིམ]. They have enough endowments for the alms and the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. མང་ཇ] The morning tea served to monks from all the monastic colleges at the main prayer assembly hall.">mangja</a> in the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. འཇང་དགུན་ཆོས] The special winter debating session for monks that was held annually in the area called Jang.">Jang günchö</a> and they have purposely built a house there. After awhile, if they had said that they want something, this we, commom monks wouldn't know. Even they want endowment, the commoon monks didn't have endowments to give them. Maybe the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. གྲྭ་ཚང] A &quot;college&quot; within a monastery, for example, in Drepung Monastery there were four main tratsang: Gomang, Loseling, Deyang and Ngagpa. These tratsang were property owning corporate entities and included monks who were organized into residential dormitories called Khamtsen.">tratsang</a> chabu might have something to give them, but we don't know.   

**Q:**  Do you remember that they had that kind of comment [Tib. བསམ་འཆར] at that time?   

**A:**  In our law case, there was no talk about <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. འཇང] 1. The area called Jang. 2. The special winter debating session for monks that was held annually in Jang.">Jang</a> günchö. Among the three great monastic seats, probably <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. སྒོ་མང] One of the large colleges in Drepung Monastery.">Gomang</a> was especially good to the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. དཔེ་ཆ་བ] A monk studying the monastic philosophical curriculum. A scholar monk.">pechawa</a> because they have a library where 3-4 people were working that lends out whatever <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. དཔེ་ཆ] Religious books/texts, scriptures.">pecha</a> a monks wants free of charge for his entire life. The student and his <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. དགེ་རྒན] 1. Teacher in a school. 2. In monastic settings it also refers to an adult monk who acted as a guardian to a younger monk. In such cases, the younger monk typically lived in the gegen&#x27;s apartment (shag). In monasteries, however, it could also mean a real teacher, or the monk who served as the guarantor for a new monk.">gegen</a> (acting as guarantor) signs out a kind if pledge for the pecha and it is returned to the library when he dies or leaves the monastery. No one in Gomang has to pay a cent for a pecha. And the monks keep about ten some or even 20-30 pecha in the shag. The librarian gets salary and alms to support this. The library gets 20 shares of alms which is for the office. Nowadays, the monks didn't have salary and the alms and buying pecha is very hard for young monks since a single volume [Tib. པུ་ཏི] may cost 50 or 60 yuan.   

**Q:**  Did the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. བློ་གསལ་གླིང] One of the main colleges in Drepung Monastery.">Loseling</a> also have the same library?   

**A:**  I don't know. Probably only <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. སྒོ་མང] One of the large colleges in Drepung Monastery.">Gomang</a> had the library. All the three great monastcic seats had the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. འཇང] 1. The area called Jang. 2. The special winter debating session for monks that was held annually in Jang.">Jang</a> gunchö, but I wouldn't know about their endowments.   

**Q:**  Was there any talk about the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. འཇང] 1. The area called Jang. 2. The special winter debating session for monks that was held annually in Jang.">Jang</a> gunchö before the law case?   

**A:**  Maybe this occurred internally.   

**Q:**  What I heard was that the other <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. གྲྭ་ཚང] A &quot;college&quot; within a monastery, for example, in Drepung Monastery there were four main tratsang: Gomang, Loseling, Deyang and Ngagpa. These tratsang were property owning corporate entities and included monks who were organized into residential dormitories called Khamtsen.">tratsang</a> had left 1-2 <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཆོས་གཤིས] A &quot;religious&quot; estate held by a monastery or lama.">chöshi</a> to be used for the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. གཏོང་སྒོ] A monastic obligation to provide the food and other necessary items served at a monastic prayer assembly meeting or some other rite; this was often a required obligation for monastic officials at the end of their term of office.">tonggo</a> for <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. འཇང] 1. The area called Jang. 2. The special winter debating session for monks that was held annually in Jang.">Jang</a> gunchö, but <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. སྒོ་མང] One of the large colleges in Drepung Monastery.">Gomang</a> didn't have that. So at one time there was an incident [Tib. གནས་ཚུལ] where the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. དཔེ་ཆ་བ] A monk studying the monastic philosophical curriculum. A scholar monk.">pechawa</a> said that they want that and the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཡིག་ཚང] The highest office dealing with monastic and religious affairs in the traditional Tibetan government. It is often called the Ecclesiastic Office. It was headed by 4 fourth rank monk officials called Trunyichemmo. The senior Trunyichemmo was called Ta Lama.">Yigtsang</a> settled the matter and left 1-2 chöshi for Jang gunchö. I don't know when this happened.   

**Q:**  In the early times, they might have reported the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. གྲྭ་ཚང] A &quot;college&quot; within a monastery, for example, in Drepung Monastery there were four main tratsang: Gomang, Loseling, Deyang and Ngagpa. These tratsang were property owning corporate entities and included monks who were organized into residential dormitories called Khamtsen.">tratsang</a>, but I don't know that there were separate <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཆོས་གཤིས] A &quot;religious&quot; estate held by a monastery or lama.">chöshi</a> for that. During Reting Regency, he gave an additional chöshi to <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. སྒོ་མང] One of the large colleges in Drepung Monastery.">Gomang</a> Tratsang. I don't know whether this was for the library.   

**Q:**  Who exactly were enchöndze? All the monastic officials, <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ལས་སྣེ] The general name for all monastic officials.">lene</a> [Tib. ལས་སྣེ] were called enchöndze, right?   

**A:**  Yes.   

**Q:**  You were the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཁང་ཚན] A monastic residential unit in which monks from specific geographic areas lived. These were corporate entities with property and internal officials. Some large khamtsen had smaller subordinate units called mi tshan. Khamtsen were part of tratsang (colleges).

The night before the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. བླ་མ་དམིགས་བརྩེ་མ] The geshe monk who recites the Migtsema prayer.">lama migtsema</a> does a prayer on the roof top and in the morning, he does another prayer which is followed by a young boy yelled the chuke. I heard in Sera its an older monk. The lama migtsema has a lot of work. When the tea is being made, the lama migtsema is in charge of starting the tea. We Drepung monks have a saying that the young boy yelling the chuke would not live long. The reason is that it is said there is snow lion milk in the 4th tea in <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. མང་ཇ] The morning tea served to monks from all the monastic colleges at the main prayer assembly hall.">mangja</a> and we should drink it even it is a small amount. It is said that the diety Tenma Traktsenma [Tib. བསྟན་མ་དྲག་བསྟན་མ] goes to get the snow lion milk for the 4th tea when the young boy yells the chuke, Tenma Tratenma would feel annowed thinking she have to go again to get the snow lion milk. That is why it is said the young boy would not live long. In front of the door of Drepung <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. རུང་ཁང] A monastic kitchen.">rungkhang</a> there is a dry birch tree [Tib. སྒྲོ་སྡོང]. It is said that the deity Tenma Traktenma would tie her deer to this birch tree.   

**Q:**  Now tell us about your work as the grain <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. གཉེར་པ] A steward or manager. In some monasteries, the nyerpa was in charge of storerooms under the authority of a higher manager called a chandzö.">nyerpa</a>, <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. འབྲུ་གཉེར] A steward (nyerpa) in charge of grain.">drunyer</a> [Tib. འབྲུ་གཉེར] and how did you get the job?   

**A:**  <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. སྒོ་མང] One of the large colleges in Drepung Monastery.">Gomang</a> Tratsang had 23 drunyer. These are appointed by the 5 <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཕྱག་སྦུག] A manager (of estates and endowments) of a monastic college or monastic khamtsen.">chabu</a> and they would go to the countryside. As the salary for 1 year, we each get 12 bo [Tib. འབོ] of barley and 5 sang.   

**Q:**  What is your work?   

**A:**  Lending grain to people. When we lend out grain, two <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཕྱག་སྦུག] A manager (of estates and endowments) of a monastic college or monastic khamtsen.">chabu</a> come to take the pledge from the debtor in which it was written about lending the grain before planting and should be repaid in autumn. At this time, since the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. འབྲུ་གཉེར] A steward (nyerpa) in charge of grain.">drunyer</a> is the person in between, we would introduce the chabu regarding who is good to give loans to. Although we didn't have the power, we do that because we have to collect the loans. The lending of grain is to get some income for monks like the proverb, "use the root as the capital and use the leaves for making offerings". We go in fall to collect the loans sometimes far away and sometimes we have to go 5 or 6 times to get the loan back.   

**Q:**  For how many years did you do that?   

**Q:**  I did this for 15 years.   

**Q:**  What was the interest rate?   

**A:**  We <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. སྒོ་མང] One of the large colleges in Drepung Monastery.">Gomang</a> had two kinds of yearly interest; one was 25%, shingandro [Tib. བཞི་ལྔ་འགྲོ] and the other was 20%, ngadrugdro [Tib. ལྔ་དྲུག་འགྲོ]. Usually the lower rate was for our own <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. མི་སེར] A term that can mean serf/bound subject as well as citizen, depending on context. For example, the miser of a lord would connote the bound subjects of that lord, whereas the miser of Tibet would connote citizens of Tibet.">miser</a> and the higher rate was for outsiders.   

**Q:**  Do the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. འབྲུ་གཉེར] A steward (nyerpa) in charge of grain.">drunyer</a> live mostly in the villages?   

**A:**  When we give loans we go with the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཕྱག་སྦུག] A manager (of estates and endowments) of a monastic college or monastic khamtsen.">chabu</a> and return after the loans were given.   

**Q:**  In what season do you go to give loans?   

**A:**  Usually, I go after the tsongjö. I have to be there for about 20 days before planting in the 2nd Tibetan month. In fall, I should be there for 2-3 months in 9-10 lunar month and stay till the threshing work is done.   

**Q:**  Do they divide the places for each <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. འབྲུ་གཉེར] A steward (nyerpa) in charge of grain.">drunyer</a>?   

**A:**  No we don't. When we go, we go together and stay in one house and there were 3 <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. འབྲུ་གཉེར] A steward (nyerpa) in charge of grain.">drunyer</a> in Phembo. The three drunyer eat and work together. When we go to collect the loans, we make copies of the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. གྲྭ་ཚང] A &quot;college&quot; within a monastery, for example, in Drepung Monastery there were four main tratsang: Gomang, Loseling, Deyang and Ngagpa. These tratsang were property owning corporate entities and included monks who were organized into residential dormitories called Khamtsen.">tratsang</a>'s loan agreements which is called, detra [Tib.འདེད་ཁྲ] and we take these with us when we collect. The main agreement is left in the monastery. When we give loans the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཕྱག་སྦུག] A manager (of estates and endowments) of a monastic college or monastic khamtsen.">chabu</a> is with us, but when we go to collect them we are alone.   

**Q:**  Would the 23 <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. འབྲུ་གཉེར] A steward (nyerpa) in charge of grain.">drunyer</a> stay together?   

**A:**  No. They are divided in many places as follows: 5 in Phembo, 2 in Chölung [Tib. ཆོས་ལུང], 1 in Kyarpo [Tib. སྐྱར་པོ] 2 in Tölung Dzem [Tib. stod lung ?] and 2 in Tölung Nyen [Tib. གཉན] etc. My job was in Phembo. There were three of us in Phembo, in Phembo, we had two granary and we were in the largest of the two granary.   

**Q:**  Does the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཕྱག་སྦུག] A manager (of estates and endowments) of a monastic college or monastic khamtsen.">chabu</a> really have to come in spring?   

**A:**  Yes, he does when the loan is given and make the agreement. The <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. འབྲུ་གཉེར] A steward (nyerpa) in charge of grain.">drunyer</a> keep the keys of the granary. The agreements are with the chabu. At the time of lending out, when the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. མི་སེར] A term that can mean serf/bound subject as well as citizen, depending on context. For example, the miser of a lord would connote the bound subjects of that lord, whereas the miser of Tibet would connote citizens of Tibet.">miser</a> hear that <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. སྒོ་མང] One of the large colleges in Drepung Monastery.">Gomang</a> Tratsang has arrives, the miser come forcing us to give loans. We don't have to go to them. But when we have to collect the loans, we have to go to them, since they won't come to us.
