**A:**  At that time, many people were expelled from the monastery.   

**Q:**  What was the reason for this dispute?   

**A:**  I heard that they didn't get along well on handing over the old and the new <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. དགེ་སྐོས] The main disciplinary official in a monastic college (tratsang).">gegö</a> and mainly the old and the new gegö confronted. Some must have backed the old one and some have backed the new one. Many were expelled and among them there was an ex-shengo, <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. སྡེ་ཡངས] One of the colleges in Drepung Monastery.">Deyang</a> chabu called Ringden la [Tib. རིགས་ལྡན་ལགས] who was a <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. སྐུ་དྲག] 1. A member of the lay aristocracy. 2. Title for government lay and monk officials. 3. A name occasionally used for the top leaders/officials in a monastery.">kudrak</a> from Phenpo [Tib. འཕན་པོ], 4 old and new gegö and one of them probably died the next day when they beat him with switches.   

**Q:**  Didn't both of the 2 die?   

**A:**  No, one died and one was among the expelled ones. It was a serious matter. I don't remember in detail.   

**Q:**  What is the difference between laymen's family or housheold and the monk's <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. 1. ཤག, 2. ཞག] 1. The apartment/room of a monk. 2. The butter fat that coagulates on the top of butter-tea when the tea is left to sit for some time. If the tea had been made with a lot of butter, this layer could be thick enough to scoop off and save to later sell or eat separately. The senior monks are usually served tea with a lot of shag.">shag</a> which was also like a household of monks. Are they same or different? Was there a custom where the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. དགེ་རྒན] 1. Teacher in a school. 2. In monastic settings it also refers to an adult monk who acted as a guardian to a younger monk. In such cases, the younger monk typically lived in the gegen&#x27;s apartment (shag). In monasteries, however, it could also mean a real teacher, or the monk who served as the guarantor for a new monk.">gegen</a> would feel [Tib. འདུ་ཤེས] like the father and the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. དགེ་ཕྲུག] 1. Student. 2. Disciple. 3. Commonly the name for monks living with a gegen or teacher. These are more like wards than real disciples.">gidru</a> would feel like children?   

**A:**  If the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. དགེ་རྒན] 1. Teacher in a school. 2. In monastic settings it also refers to an adult monk who acted as a guardian to a younger monk. In such cases, the younger monk typically lived in the gegen&#x27;s apartment (shag). In monasteries, however, it could also mean a real teacher, or the monk who served as the guarantor for a new monk.">gegen</a> have <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. དགེ་ཕྲུག] 1. Student. 2. Disciple. 3. Commonly the name for monks living with a gegen or teacher. These are more like wards than real disciples.">gidru</a> and if it is a big <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཤག་ཚང] 1. The household or family of a monk that consisted of multiple monks. 2. The apartment of a monk household.">shagtsang</a>, then it is just like a household and they would become like a household from generation to generation. But if it is a simple monk [Tib. གྲྭ་པ་གྲྭ་རྐྱང] and if the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. 1. ཤག, 2. ཞག] 1. The apartment/room of a monk. 2. The butter fat that coagulates on the top of butter-tea when the tea is left to sit for some time. If the tea had been made with a lot of butter, this layer could be thick enough to scoop off and save to later sell or eat separately. The senior monks are usually served tea with a lot of shag.">shag</a> is not that big, when the gegen dies, the gidru wouldn't be thrown out right away and they would inherit the gegen's shag. And if there is a bad gidru who violates the discipline of the monastery, the gegen would throw him out. In general, the big shagtsang are exactly like laymen housheolds. In the past, the shagtsang even had their names. Shag, [monk's apartment] in gegenral were scares in the monastery. Hamdong, e.g., had a limit of 1,800 monks, but there were probably 2,000. There were only 29 common houses, jikhang [Tib. སྤྱི་ཁང]. There was no room in the Hamdong jikhang for them, so some had to rent shag from other <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཁང་ཚན] A monastic residential unit in which monks from specific geographic areas lived. These were corporate entities with property and internal officials. Some large khamtsen had smaller subordinate units called mi tshan. Khamtsen were part of tratsang (colleges). For example, Hamdong Khamtsen was part of Gomang College in Drepung Monastery.">khamtsen</a> who had some vacancy and they have to pay the rent. We also have to pay the rent for the shag in one's own khamtsen.   

**Q:**  After <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཡིག་ཚང] The highest office dealing with monastic and religious affairs in the traditional Tibetan government. It is often called the Ecclesiastic Office. It was headed by 4 fourth rank monk officials called Trunyichemmo. The senior Trunyichemmo was called Ta Lama.">Yigtsang</a> settled the law case, some of you still stayed in the monastery, right? I heard that the Dalai Lama gave several thousands of <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. རྡོ་ཚད] A currency unit in traditional Tibet that was equal to 50 ngüsang.">dotse</a> to <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. སྒོ་མང] One of the large colleges in Drepung Monastery.">Gomang</a> Tratsang as a kind of endowment [Tib. ཐེབ་རྩ]. Do you remember that?   

**A:**  Yes some of us were allowed to stay in the monastery. I haven't heard this at all and I have never used it. If it was a regular custom where the Dalai Lama gave something to the great monastic seats, we wouldn't know because we were expelled. The case was settled on the 13th of the 12th lunar month.   

**Q:**  I heard that Kündeling Dzasa was the backer of the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. དཔེ་ཆ་བ] A monk studying the monastic philosophical curriculum. A scholar monk.">pechawa</a>, did anything happen where the pechawa bribed Kündeling Dzasa?   

**A:**  Probably they did.   

**Q:**  There was a talk that they [pechawa] took out <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ད་ཡང; ch. 大洋] A Chinese silver dollar that had the image of Yuan Shikai on its face. It was used by the Chinese government in Tibet in the 1950s because Tibetans did not accept Chinese paper currency.">dayang</a> from the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. གྲྭ་ཚང] A &quot;college&quot; within a monastery, for example, in Drepung Monastery there were four main tratsang: Gomang, Loseling, Deyang and Ngagpa. These tratsang were property owning corporate entities and included monks who were organized into residential dormitories called Khamtsen.">tratsang</a> storage [Tib. བཀར་འཇུག] and bribed him. Did that happen?   

**A:**  I swear by the Buddha statue in the Jokahng [Tib. ཇོ་རི] that there was a danger of doing that because the money storage was right in the room where the umdze, laja and <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཕྱག་སྦུག] A manager (of estates and endowments) of a monastic college or monastic khamtsen.">chabu</a> were working.   

**Q:**  So if these three people worked in unity [Tib. ཁ་སྒྲིལ], they could take out the money, right?   

**A:**  Yes, it is ready to be taken out [Tib. བཏོན་ཆོག་ཆོག]. But, to tell you the truth, I don't know anything about this having occurred. The <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. དཔེ་ཆ་བ] A monk studying the monastic philosophical curriculum. A scholar monk.">pechawa</a>'s main supporters were Drönyerchemmo Phala Thuten Wönden [Tib. ཕ་ལྷ་ཐུབ་བསྟན་འོད་ལྡན] and Kündeling Dzasa who were mahjong playmates.   

**Q:**  Was there any reason for Kündeling having relations with <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. སྒོ་མང] One of the large colleges in Drepung Monastery.">Gomang</a>?   

**A:**  Kündeling was belonged to <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. སྒོ་མང] One of the large colleges in Drepung Monastery.">Gomang</a>, so we used to seek advises from the old Kündeling Dzasa Tempa Wangchug [Tib. བསྟན་པ་དབང་ཕྱུག] on important decisions and he would over see [Tib. ལྟ] the Gomang Tratsang. The new <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. རྫ་ས] 1. A high rank in the Tibetan government. 2. A top manager-like official for the labrang of important incarnate lamas, especially those who in the past had served as regents of Tibet.">dzasa</a> in general would also over see the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. གྲྭ་ཚང] A &quot;college&quot; within a monastery, for example, in Drepung Monastery there were four main tratsang: Gomang, Loseling, Deyang and Ngagpa. These tratsang were property owning corporate entities and included monks who were organized into residential dormitories called Khamtsen.">tratsang</a> though he might not be the first person saying that the salary should be paid in the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཆོས་ར] The special grove (&quot;dharma grove&quot;) in monasteries where monks formally met to practice debating.">chöra</a>, but he and Phala became the back door supporters for the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. དཔེ་ཆ་བ] A monk studying the monastic philosophical curriculum. A scholar monk.">pechawa</a> and then he heard about the salary. That's why we said, "we, the simple monks have been carrying only <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཁ་བཏགས] A Tibetan ceremonial scarf given to lamas, visitors, etc.">khata</a> and we didn't have back door supporters and we didn't bribe the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. སྐུ་དྲག] 1. A member of the lay aristocracy. 2. Title for government lay and monk officials. 3. A name occasionally used for the top leaders/officials in a monastery.">kudrak</a> even a simgle <a href="#" data-tooltip="[ch. 分] 1/100th of a yuan; one cent.">fen</a> by using the public property [Tib. སྤྱི་རྫས]. Some of our people knew <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. དྲུང་ཡིག་ཆེན་མོ] The title of the four heads of the Yigtsang office (Ecclesiastic Office).">Trunyichemmo</a> Bumthang [Tib. འབུམ་ཐང] and we offered a khata Ashe, but he didnt accept the khata and returned it back.   

**Q:**  I heard that Kündeling was backing <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. དཔེ་ཆ་བ] A monk studying the monastic philosophical curriculum. A scholar monk.">pechawa</a> because he was holding a grudge against the common monks because they wanted a <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. གཞིས་ཀ] A manorial estate.">shiga</a> back that had been held by Kündeling and they wanted the shiga to be managed by the tratsang. Is it true ?   

**A:**  I heard that in the very early times, there was a dispute [Tib. ལབ་རྒྱུ] with the common monks in <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. སྒོ་མང] One of the large colleges in Drepung Monastery.">Gomang</a> and at that time, they appointed the additional clerk and Tölung Nyen [Tib. གཉན] Shiga was given then. I don't know whether Kündeling <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. རྫ་ས] 1. A high rank in the Tibetan government. 2. A top manager-like official for the labrang of important incarnate lamas, especially those who in the past had served as regents of Tibet.">dzasa</a> supported or not because I was not there.   

**Q:**  At the time of the dispute, was there any talk about the reason why Kündeling <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. རྫ་ས] 1. A high rank in the Tibetan government. 2. A top manager-like official for the labrang of important incarnate lamas, especially those who in the past had served as regents of Tibet.">dzasa</a> supported the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. དཔེ་ཆ་བ] A monk studying the monastic philosophical curriculum. A scholar monk.">pechawa</a> was because he was holding a grudge?   

**A:**  No. Not at all.   

**Q:**  <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. སྒོ་མང] One of the large colleges in Drepung Monastery.">Gomang</a> Tratsang had a <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. གཞིས་ཀ] A manorial estate.">shiga</a> in Champaling [Tib. བྱམས་པ་གླིང], right?   

**A:**  Yes. This dispute happened in the very early times.   

**Q:**  I heard that Kündeling didn't return this to Gomang.   

**A:**  Yes, you are right. This was called the Champaling salary and at that time, they [Kündeling] had to increase the salary when Gamang said that the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. གྲྭ་ཚང] A &quot;college&quot; within a monastery, for example, in Drepung Monastery there were four main tratsang: Gomang, Loseling, Deyang and Ngagpa. These tratsang were property owning corporate entities and included monks who were organized into residential dormitories called Khamtsen.">tratsang</a> is going to manage the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. གཞིས་ཀ] A manorial estate.">shiga</a>, Kündeling said it will not be okay if the tratsang managed the shiga and they will increase the salary. In the past, the salary was money salary like 3-4 <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཏམ་ཀ] A unit in the traditional Tibetan currency system that was equal to 4 sang.">tranka</a> which was famous in the early times.   

**Q:**  At that time, was Wöser Gyentsen [Tib. འོད་ཟེར་རྒྱལ་མཚན] the Kündeling <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. རྫ་ས] 1. A high rank in the Tibetan government. 2. A top manager-like official for the labrang of important incarnate lamas, especially those who in the past had served as regents of Tibet.">dzasa</a>?   

**A:**  Probably not. This happened during the time of the abbot Wöser Dorje [Tib. འོད་ཟེར་རྡོ་རྗེ] when I became a monk.   

**Q:**  Before that, Wöser Gyentsen was a tsendrön, right?   

**A:**  Yes and he was demoted from the tsendrön because of a dispute during <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. སྟག་བྲག] The regent of Tibet who replaced Reting in 1941 and served until 1950 when the 14th Dalai Lama assumed power.">Taktra</a> Regency. Later, he got the Sitsab Lobsang Tashi [Tib. བློ་བཟང་བཀྲ་ཤིས] as his back door supporter and became tsendrön again and then he became the Kündeling dzasa. The Champaling dispute happened at the time of our sacred [Tib. རྩ་བ་ཆེན་པོ] Mongolian abbot. It was his idea when they started to pay one <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཁལ] A traditional volume measurement used for measuring grain in traditional Tibetan society. Sizes of this unit varied somewhat, but the official government khe (called mkhar ru or bstan dzin mkha ru) weighed about 28-31 pounds for barley. It was used to convey the size of fields. For example, a field said to be 10 khe in size meant that 10 khe of seed could be sown on that field.">khe</a> of grain to the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. སྒོ་མང] One of the large colleges in Drepung Monastery.">Gomang</a> monks. He also made the new rule to have the full day <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཚོགས] 1. A prayer assembly meeting in monasteries when all the monks come to an assembly hall and chant prayers together. 2. An offering made of tsamba, butter and dry cheese in the shape of a cone.">tsog</a> to perform the ritual on the 16 Arhats, Neten Judrug [Tib. གནས་བརྟན་བཅུ་དྲུག] on the 15th of the 4th lunar month where rice gruel <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཐུག་པ] 1. A porridge or gruel-like soup typically made with tsamba, and if available, meat and cheese. 2. Noodle dishes in broth.">thukpa</a> and <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. མང་ཇ] The morning tea served to monks from all the monastic colleges at the main prayer assembly hall.">mangja</a> was served.   

**Q:**  Were you arrested after you became the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. གཉེར་པ] A steward or manager. In some monasteries, the nyerpa was in charge of storerooms under the authority of a higher manager called a chandzö.">nyerpa</a> of Dongkar [Tib. གདོང་དཀར] Dzong?   

**A:**  Yes.   

**Q:**  For how many days did you do the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. གཉེར་པ] A steward or manager. In some monasteries, the nyerpa was in charge of storerooms under the authority of a higher manager called a chandzö.">nyerpa</a>?   

**A:**  I stayed in Dongkar for 7-8 days. The reason for arresting me was because when the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཆུ་བཞི་སྒང་དྲུག] The anti-Chinese Khamba insurgency force in Tibet that began in 1957 in Lhasa and launched an uprising against the Chinese the following year. The name means, &quot;four rivers and six mountain ranges,&quot; and refers to Eastern Tibet.">Chushigandru</a> came to Nyethang [Tib. མཉེས་ཐང], I went there for the greeting [Tib. འཚམས་ཞུ]. For that, I was sentenced to 20 years imprisonment. At that time, they held a meeting in Dongkar and we also prepared 200-300 <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཁལ] A traditional volume measurement used for measuring grain in traditional Tibetan society. Sizes of this unit varied somewhat, but the official government khe (called mkhar ru or bstan dzin mkha ru) weighed about 28-31 pounds for barley. It was used to convey the size of fields. For example, a field said to be 10 khe in size meant that 10 khe of seed could be sown on that field.">khe</a> of grain from Dongkar for their horses fodder and we also gave hay and firewood, 1 load of butter packed in skin and one box of tea. We didnt get a chance to send these. For the greeting we only spend one <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཁ་བཏགས] A Tibetan ceremonial scarf given to lamas, visitors, etc.">khata</a> Ashe. On the day, the Chushigandru came to Dongkar, 5-6 of us, the reprersentatives were sent from Dongar Dzong for the greeting carrying a khata Ashe. Since I was the acting <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. རྫོང་དཔོན] The head of a dzong in the traditional Tibetan government.">dzongpön</a> called dzongtsab [Tib. རྫོང་ཚབ], I had a bigger name.   

**Q:**  At that time, was Dongkar Takog <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. སྐུ་ཞབས] A respectful term of address usually for monks, but also to show respect to a layman.">Kusho</a> Awala [Tib. ? sku zhabs a wa lags] with you in Dongkar?   

**A:**  No, he was on the revolution [Chinese] side. He was the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. རྒྱ་མཚོ] 1. An area in the Tsang region of Central Tibet. 2. Ocean.">gyatso</a> gempo [Tib. བརྒྱ་ཚོ་རྒན་པོ] in charge of sending horse corvees etc.   

**Q:**  He was called Samten La, [Tib. བསམ་གཏན་ལགས], right?   

**A:**  Yes, the eloquent one. When <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཆུ་བཞི་སྒང་དྲུག] The anti-Chinese Khamba insurgency force in Tibet that began in 1957 in Lhasa and launched an uprising against the Chinese the following year. The name means, &quot;four rivers and six mountain ranges,&quot; and refers to Eastern Tibet.">Chushigandru</a> came, there was a <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. གཉེར་པ] A steward or manager. In some monasteries, the nyerpa was in charge of storerooms under the authority of a higher manager called a chandzö.">nyerpa</a> who was a <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. བོད་པ] 1. A person from Central Tibet (tib. དབུས) or sometimes someone from political Tibet in contrast to persons from Kham and Amdo. 2. Böpa is also used nowadays as a general name for all ethnic Tibetans.">böba</a> and an eloquent one and there was one known to be Chamdo magji. I met two of them. They said "when the revolt take place, can you block the motor road in Tölung? We said "we can't block the main motor road which is built by the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. མི་སེར] A term that can mean serf/bound subject as well as citizen, depending on context. For example, the miser of a lord would connote the bound subjects of that lord, whereas the miser of Tibet would connote citizens of Tibet.">miser</a> of the Shun [Tib. ཤུན] [Dongkar]". Then they asked, "can you destroy the small bridges for crossing the streams back and forth? We said "we can destroy them". [laughter] They said "we heard that in Dongkar, there are many people consorting with the Chinese regiment. Who are those people? I said "I've just arrived Dongkar Dzong, but I heard that there are about 4 such people like Samten, Takog [Tib. ?] and Gang Drepog [Tib. sgang ?]. But I have not seen them doing things. Because of this conversation, I got 20 years imprisonment. [laughter]   

**Q:**  When the revolt was taking place. Did you think you could win against the Chinese with all your army at that time?   

**A:**  At this time, I didnt have any idea whether <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཆུ་བཞི་སྒང་དྲུག] The anti-Chinese Khamba insurgency force in Tibet that began in 1957 in Lhasa and launched an uprising against the Chinese the following year. The name means, &quot;four rivers and six mountain ranges,&quot; and refers to Eastern Tibet.">Chushigandru</a> could win or lose. I didn't have any choice but to go to the Chushigandru because I was afraid. It was said that if the leaders didnt help the Chushigandru they would catch them and punish them. On that night, when we came to Nyethang, Chusigandru had seized the guy called Damsim [Tib. དན་གཟིམ] and shakled him and handcuffed him. Among us, there was one called Gang Drepog who was one of the tsodrag. The <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. མི་སེར] A term that can mean serf/bound subject as well as citizen, depending on context. For example, the miser of a lord would connote the bound subjects of that lord, whereas the miser of Tibet would connote citizens of Tibet.">miser</a> also told us, "last night, Damsim was seized, it is not going to be good among you people. So you should be careful because the Chinese are also suspecting people amongst you" When we came back, they didn't seize people, though they had planned to seize Gang Drepog.
