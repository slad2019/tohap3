**Q:**  Is the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཕྱག་སྦུག] A manager (of estates and endowments) of a monastic college or monastic khamtsen.">chabu</a> the highest official?   

**A:**  Yes. The middle one is the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཁང་ཚན] A monastic residential unit in which monks from specific geographic areas lived. These were corporate entities with property and internal officials. Some large khamtsen had smaller subordinate units called mi tshan. Khamtsen were part of tratsang (colleges). For example, Hamdong Khamtsen was part of Gomang College in Drepung Monastery.">khamtsen</a>'s tsondu.   

**Q:**  Which is the lowest official?   

**A:**  The <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཁང་ཚན] A monastic residential unit in which monks from specific geographic areas lived. These were corporate entities with property and internal officials. Some large khamtsen had smaller subordinate units called mi tshan. Khamtsen were part of tratsang (colleges). For example, Hamdong Khamtsen was part of Gomang College in Drepung Monastery.">khamtsen</a> <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. གཉེར་པ] A steward or manager. In some monasteries, the nyerpa was in charge of storerooms under the authority of a higher manager called a chandzö.">nyerpa</a> is the lowest official. Anyone in the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. མི་ཚན] A sub-unit of a khamtsen.">mitsen</a> who knows something about managing the economy could do the nyerpa. After the nyerpa work is done, then one does the khamtsen gegen. Then after the khamtsen gegen one does the khamtsen chandzö and get into the tsondu.   

**Q:**  In some <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཁང་ཚན] A monastic residential unit in which monks from specific geographic areas lived. These were corporate entities with property and internal officials. Some large khamtsen had smaller subordinate units called mi tshan. Khamtsen were part of tratsang (colleges). For example, Hamdong Khamtsen was part of Gomang College in Drepung Monastery.">khamtsen</a> you have to do the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. གཉེར་པ] A steward or manager. In some monasteries, the nyerpa was in charge of storerooms under the authority of a higher manager called a chandzö.">nyerpa</a> in turn with regard to seniority, right?   

**A:**  Yes, it is the same. Every <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. མི་ཚན] A sub-unit of a khamtsen.">mitsen</a> has <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. གཉེར་པ] A steward or manager. In some monasteries, the nyerpa was in charge of storerooms under the authority of a higher manager called a chandzö.">nyerpa</a>. And each monk has to do nyerpa when his turn come around in accordance with seniority. It is an obligation for all the monks called shamtre [Tib. ཤམ་ཁྲལ]. After doing nyerpa, he then has the right to attend the mitsen's <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཚོགས་འདུ] 1. The general name for the various types of Tibetan government assemblies. 2. Any assembly, e.g., the assembly (meeting) of monks in a college.">tsondu</a> and the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. བོད་པ] 1.

**Q:**  Is there a <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. མི་ཚན] A sub-unit of a khamtsen.">mitsen</a> gegen parallel to that of the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཁང་ཚན་དགེ་རྒན] The head official of a khamtsen.">khamtsen gegen</a>?   

**A:**  No. There is just the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. མི་ཚན] A sub-unit of a khamtsen.">mitsen</a> <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. གཉེར་པ] A steward or manager. In some monasteries, the nyerpa was in charge of storerooms under the authority of a higher manager called a chandzö.">nyerpa</a>. There are nine mitsen and two nyerpa in our Hamdong <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཁང་ཚན] A monastic residential unit in which monks from specific geographic areas lived. These were corporate entities with property and internal officials. Some large khamtsen had smaller subordinate units called mi tshan. Khamtsen were part of tratsang (colleges). For example, Hamdong Khamtsen was part of Gomang College in Drepung Monastery.">khamtsen</a>. Every year we chose two nyerpa from the nine mitsen by turns. The mitsen will nominate someone who is appropriate for the job and goes by turn. So the khamtsen nyerpa is selected who is appropriate [Tib. འོས་བབ] but the mitsen nyerpa is selected by seniority.   

**Q:**  How does a monk get the right to be a part of the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཁང་ཚན] A monastic residential unit in which monks from specific geographic areas lived. These were corporate entities with property and internal officials. Some large khamtsen had smaller subordinate units called mi tshan. Khamtsen were part of tratsang (colleges). For example, Hamdong Khamtsen was part of Gomang College in Drepung Monastery.">khamtsen</a> tsondu?   

**A:**  First a monk must do the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. གཉེར་པ] A steward or manager. In some monasteries, the nyerpa was in charge of storerooms under the authority of a higher manager called a chandzö.">nyerpa</a> and then the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཁང་ཚན་དགེ་རྒན] The head official of a khamtsen.">khamtsen gegen</a> and after that he becomes the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཁང་ཚན] A monastic residential unit in which monks from specific geographic areas lived. These were corporate entities with property and internal officials. Some large khamtsen had smaller subordinate units called mi tshan. Khamtsen were part of tratsang (colleges). For example, Hamdong Khamtsen was part of Gomang College in Drepung Monastery.">khamtsen</a> tsondu member.   

**Q:**  Is the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཁང་ཚན་དགེ་རྒན] The head official of a khamtsen.">khamtsen gegen</a> 1 year term?   

**A:**  Yes. But Hamdong and Samlo <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཁང་ཚན་དགེ་རྒན] The head official of a khamtsen.">khamtsen gegen</a> are different from the khamtsen gegen of other <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཁང་ཚན] A monastic residential unit in which monks from specific geographic areas lived. These were corporate entities with property and internal officials. Some large khamtsen had smaller subordinate units called mi tshan. Khamtsen were part of tratsang (colleges). For example, Hamdong Khamtsen was part of Gomang College in Drepung Monastery.">khamtsen</a>. Even their costume is different from that of other khamtsen gegen. At <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. སྐལ་ལེན] A special right allowing certain monks to take their share of alms outside of the prayer assembly hall. This privilege meant they did not have to attend the prayer session to get their alms.">kelen</a> they can get up first and get the alms. Because Hamdong and Samlo khamtsen are the masters of tenure document [Tib. བཀའ་གཏན་ཚིག] they have higher status than the other khamtsen. Hamdong khamtsen was under the Prime Minister, Desi Sanggye Gyatso [Tib. སྡེ་སྲིད་སངས་རྒྱས་རྒྱ་མཚོ] and <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. བསམ་ལྷོ་ཁང་ཚན] The name of a residential unit (khamtsen) in Sera Monastery.">Samlo Khamtsen</a> was under Gushri Tendzin Chögyel [Tib. གོ་ཤྲི་བསྟན་འཛིན་ཆོས་རྒྱལ]. Thus the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. དགེ་རྒན] 1. Teacher in a school. 2. In monastic settings it also refers to an adult monk who acted as a guardian to a younger monk. In such cases, the younger monk typically lived in the gegen&#x27;s apartment (shag). In monasteries, however, it could also mean a real teacher, or the monk who served as the guarantor for a new monk.">gegen</a> of Samlo and Hamdo khamtsen can sit equivalent to the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཚོགས་ཆེན] The main assembly hall of a monastery. The assembly hall for the monastery as a whole.">tsogchen</a> shengo. The shengo can't order these gegen to come to his presence.   

**Q:**  So they had the privilege, right?.   

**A:**  Yes.   

**Q:**  What kind of work does the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཁང་ཚན་དགེ་རྒན] The head official of a khamtsen.">khamtsen gegen</a> do?   

**A:**  The two <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཁང་ཚན་དགེ་རྒན] The head official of a khamtsen.">khamtsen gegen</a> (Hamdong and Samlo) can get many kinds of income every year such as money, grain, etc, but they must pay for the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. རྩམ་པ] The traditional Tibetan staple food that consists of grain that is roasted (popped), usually in heated sand, and then ground into a flour.">tsamba</a> and firewood in the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཁང་ཚན] A monastic residential unit in which monks from specific geographic areas lived. These were corporate entities with property and internal officials. Some large khamtsen had smaller subordinate units called mi tshan. Khamtsen were part of tratsang (colleges). For example, Hamdong Khamtsen was part of Gomang College in Drepung Monastery.">khamtsen</a>. And when there is an argument in the khamtsen, they become disciplinary officer just like the shengo. He often patrols in the alley, sanglam [Tib. སྲང་ལམ] of the monastery with a big stick in his hand and carries a torch [Tib. དཔལ་འབར] and sometimes supervises the monks reciting prayer, kyorta [Tib. སྐྱོར་རྟ] and siting for the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. མཚན་ཉིད] Buddhist dialectics. This is taught after the six-year curriculum called düdra.">tsenyi</a> debate. If they find someone is not concentrating, they beat him with the switches. Only the khamtsen gegen of these two khamtsen have this authority to beat like this right on the spot without discussion. This is a special right.   

**Q:**  In the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. གྲྭ་ཚང] A &quot;college&quot; within a monastery, for example, in Drepung Monastery there were four main tratsang: Gomang, Loseling, Deyang and Ngagpa. These tratsang were property owning corporate entities and included monks who were organized into residential dormitories called Khamtsen.">tratsang</a>, can't the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. དགེ་སྐོས] The main disciplinary official in a monastic college (tratsang).">gegö</a> beat monks?   

**A:**  Yes.   

**Q:**  Can they do so in other <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. གྲྭ་ཚང] A &quot;college&quot; within a monastery, for example, in Drepung Monastery there were four main tratsang: Gomang, Loseling, Deyang and Ngagpa. These tratsang were property owning corporate entities and included monks who were organized into residential dormitories called Khamtsen.">tratsang</a>?   

**A:**  Yes. I don't know about <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. སྡེ་ཡངས] One of the colleges in Drepung Monastery.">Deyang</a> and Ngagba tratsang. In <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. བློ་གསལ་གླིང] One of the main colleges in Drepung Monastery.">Loseling</a> tratsang if there is a quarrel among monks, the monks will be fined in money. But in our <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. སྒོ་མང] One of the large colleges in Drepung Monastery.">Gomang</a> tratsang, in order to punish a monk the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. དགེ་སྐོས] The main disciplinary official in a monastic college (tratsang).">gegö</a> can only beat the monk, not allowed to fine him in money. After the gegö beats the monk with swithes, the matter is resolved. If they need to punish the monks, the gegö makes him do labor such as makes him carry sand from the mountains to the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཆོས་ར] The special grove (&quot;dharma grove&quot;) in monasteries where monks formally met to practice debating.">chöra</a>, or makes him carry water, or make the lid of the cauldron etc.   

**Q:**  It is said that there was a big quarrel between the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. བླ་རྒྱུད་པ] A term for the common monks in a monastery (in contrast to the scholar monks who were actively studying the Buddhist doctrine).">lagyüba</a> and <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. དཔེ་ཆ་བ] A monk studying the monastic philosophical curriculum. A scholar monk.">pechawa</a> in <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. སྒོ་མང] One of the large colleges in Drepung Monastery.">Gomang</a> Tratsang and it was said that you were involved in the incident. Can you tell us in some detail about it, for example, the cause, the process and how the incident was resolved?   

**A:**  At first in <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. སྒོ་མང] One of the large colleges in Drepung Monastery.">Gomang</a>, when the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཆོས་ར] The special grove (&quot;dharma grove&quot;) in monasteries where monks formally met to practice debating.">chöra</a> was convened during the day three times where they do the prayers and the debate. But there were many monks had the privilege and who regularly did not need to attend the chöra. According to the old customs, 1. one such category of monks called enchöndze [Tib. དབེན་ཆོས་མཛད] [monks who are officials of the tratsang] They each can have two servants.   

**Q:**  <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. དབེན་ཆོས་མཛད] A monastic term for higher status monks that included chöndze, abbots, shungshab (monk officials), ex-umdze, ex-jiso, ex-phodrang depa and ex-chandzö.">Enchöndze</a> means the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. གྲྭ་ཚང] A &quot;college&quot; within a monastery, for example, in Drepung Monastery there were four main tratsang: Gomang, Loseling, Deyang and Ngagpa. These tratsang were property owning corporate entities and included monks who were organized into residential dormitories called Khamtsen.">tratsang</a> chöndze, right?   

**A:**  Yes and they were the monks who have special privileges in the tratsang. Some of the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. སྡེ་བ་གཞུང] The name of the traditional Tibetan government.">dewashung</a> shungshab also get the alms share from our tratsang.   

**Q:**  I heard they sit above the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. སྤྲུལ་སྐུ] An incarnate lama.">trüku</a>, right?   

**A:**  All the enchöndze and their two servants have the privilege. And enchöndze is a general name for all those with this special right. A second category was of the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. དགེ་ཤེས] An advanced degree earned by scholar monks.">geshe</a> those who finish geshe exam, called geshe tsentag <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཐོན་ཟིན] The ex-monastic officials who had the title of &quot;thon&quot; by virtue of having completed their monastic job obligations.">thönsin</a> [Tib.དགེ་བཤེས་མཚན་རྟགས་ཐོན་ཟིན]. These were the geshe who passed their exam in the Mönlam Chemmo. It is the senior geshe. The third category of monks were the trepön treyog [Tib. གྲལ་དཔོན་གྲལ་གཡོག]-- these are the senior monks who weren't <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. དཔེ་ཆ་བ] A monk studying the monastic philosophical curriculum. A scholar monk.">pechawa</a> who sit in the front of the rows of monks; the 4th is the servants of the enchöndze; the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཁང་ཚན་དགེ་རྒན] The head official of a khamtsen.">khamtsen gegen</a> of the 16 <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. སྒོ་མང] One of the large colleges in Drepung Monastery.">Gomang</a> Khamtsen and the officials of these 16 have special privileges. In all the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. གྲྭ་ཚང] A &quot;college&quot; within a monastery, for example, in Drepung Monastery there were four main tratsang: Gomang, Loseling, Deyang and Ngagpa. These tratsang were property owning corporate entities and included monks who were organized into residential dormitories called Khamtsen.">tratsang</a> jikhang [Tib. སྤྱི་ཁང] there were the sweepers called Ragor Gemba [Tib. ར་འཁོར་རྒན་པ].   

**Q:**  What is jikhang?   

**A:**  Jikhang means the residence where the monks stay. In most of the 16 <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཁང་ཚན] A monastic residential unit in which monks from specific geographic areas lived. These were corporate entities with property and internal officials. Some large khamtsen had smaller subordinate units called mi tshan. Khamtsen were part of tratsang (colleges). For example, Hamdong Khamtsen was part of Gomang College in Drepung Monastery.">khamtsen</a> there are 4-5 officials who are exempt such as the 2 khamtsen gegen and <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. གཉེར་པ] A steward or manager. In some monasteries, the nyerpa was in charge of storerooms under the authority of a higher manager called a chandzö.">nyerpa</a>. But in Hamdong khamtsen there were about 43 such officials with special privilege. All the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཚོགས་འདུ] 1. The general name for the various types of Tibetan government assemblies. 2. Any assembly, e.g., the assembly (meeting) of monks in a college.">tsondu</a> members have the privilege. These were the 2 khamtsen gegen, 3 <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཇ་མ] The monk(s) in charge of a monastery&#x27;s kitchen.">jama</a> and nyerpa, [Tib. ཇ་བྱེར་གསུམ] 2 shaglhag [Tib. ཤག་ལྷག] who were the in charge of cleaning and renovating the houses of the 29 jikhang, 2 caretakers, <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. དཀོན་གཉེར] The monk caretaker of a chapel/temple.">könyer</a> [Tib. སྐུ་གཉེར] the grain nerpa and his servants, <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. འབྲུ་གཉེར] A steward (nyerpa) in charge of grain.">drunyer</a> ngoyog [Tib. 'bru gnyer ngo g.yog. In Samlo, there were probably about 15-20 such privileged monks. These are the monks who do not have to go to the regular chöra at all. They have special privilege. In my tratsang there was income from two kinds of alms and manja. Alms refers to the tea given to monks and the money given to monks in tsog and there were shares to be given. Salary refers to the money. The monks line up in seniority in front of the Tratsang's main gate, གོམཆོར [Tib. སྒོ་མཆོར] and get the distribution of whatever the salary was that day. The elder monks, the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. དགེ་སྐོས] The main disciplinary official in a monastic college (tratsang).">gegö</a> and umdze call the monk's names in order of seniority, and when their name is called, the monks go and take their salary and leave.   

**Q:**  Are there extra shares in salary?   

**A:**  A little, but not as much as with alms. Some have privilage on getting alms. Thus, for salary, it was okay to go to collect the salary without do not need to go to the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཆོས་ར] The special grove (&quot;dharma grove&quot;) in monasteries where monks formally met to practice debating.">chöra</a>. The fundamental reason for the dispute was regarding the distribution of this salary. A few monks in the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. གྲྭ་ཚང] A &quot;college&quot; within a monastery, for example, in Drepung Monastery there were four main tratsang: Gomang, Loseling, Deyang and Ngagpa. These tratsang were property owning corporate entities and included monks who were organized into residential dormitories called Khamtsen.">tratsang</a> who wanted to reform this distribution. They consulted with each other and made a new rule which said that salary was to be distributed in the chöra [thus all the monks had to be there to receive it] and waiting in line under the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. སྒོ་མཆོར] The area outside of the monastic assembly hall that is supported by tall pillars.">gomchor</a> was to be eliminated. The salary was only for those staying in the chöra. This was the root of the raw case. For example, if there was a <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཁང་ཚན་དགེ་རྒན] The head official of a khamtsen.">khamtsen gegen</a> who was performing a ritual in his <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. 1. ཤག, 2. ཞག] 1. The apartment/room of a monk. 2. The butter fat that coagulates on the top of butter-tea when the tea is left to sit for some time. If the tea had been made with a lot of butter, this layer could be thick enough to scoop off and save to later sell or eat separately. The senior monks are usually served tea with a lot of shag.">shag</a>, then he had to serve tea to the prayers, etc., so if he had to go to the chöra, he had to close the door and go. But if it was at the gomchor, then the monks who worked in the jikhang (such as cleaner, tea provider, etc. could go there to get their salary in groups and some go first and then return and the next groups can go. So it was ready for every body to get the ssalary. Thus, this meant they didn't have to close the jikhang and that there would be monks in it at all times, and thus no danger of things being stolen. And for the persons with privileges, they could send a <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. དགེ་ཕྲུག] 1. Student. 2. Disciple. 3. Commonly the name for monks living with a gegen or teacher. These are more like wards than real disciples.">gidru</a> to collect their salary from the gomchor. On the other hand, when salary was given in the chöra, which took a long time, it was impossible to go there group after groups as every monk except the enchöndze had to personally go to the chöra to get the salary. As for the enchöndze, they get the salary even they didn't go to the chöra. The workers of the 16 <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཁང་ཚན] A monastic residential unit in which monks from specific geographic areas lived. These were corporate entities with property and internal officials. Some large khamtsen had smaller subordinate units called mi tshan. Khamtsen were part of tratsang (colleges). For example, Hamdong Khamtsen was part of Gomang College in Drepung Monastery.">khamtsen</a> and the sweepers in the jikhang, the servants of the enchöndze, <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. དགེ་ཤེས] An advanced degree earned by scholar monks.">geshe</a> tsentag <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཐོན་ཟིན] The ex-monastic officials who had the title of &quot;thon&quot; by virtue of having completed their monastic job obligations.">thönsin</a>, the senior monks of the drepön dreyog, however, had to now go in person. They got no shares if they didn't go. Under the new system, if a privileged monks like enchöndze didn't want to go himself to collect salary, he could take a <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཁ་བཏགས] A Tibetan ceremonial scarf given to lamas, visitors, etc.">khata</a> and a coin of one <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཞོ] A unit in the traditional Tibetan currency system. 10 sho equaled to 1 sang and 10 karma equaled one sho.">sho</a> to the abbot and 8 <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. སྐར་མ] 1. The smallest currency unit (a copper coin) in the traditional Tibetan currency system. Ten karma equaled 1 sho. 2. A work point in post-1959 Tibet. 3. A person&#x27;s name.">karma</a> to the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. དགེ་སྐོས] The main disciplinary official in a monastic college (tratsang).">gegö</a> and ask permission to miss the chöra. It is permissible to ask the abbot once in his 6 years term and the gegö once in his six months term. It was said that this custom of giving salary was demolished and this became the root of the law case. So the majority were the simple <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. བླ་རྒྱུད་པ] A term for the common monks in a monastery (in contrast to the scholar monks who were actively studying the Buddhist doctrine).">lagyüba</a> monks and there were also geshe tsentag thönsin who didn't have the privileges and among the monks who had the privilege, there were also lagyüba and all kind. Then the case started and the monks requested to pay the salary under the gomchor which might have been done many years ago before I was born. There was a famous abbot called Gungru Khenchen Tenpa Chönphel, [Tib. གུང་རུ་མཁན་ཆེན་བསྟན་པ་ཆོས་འཕེལ] who asked for the divination to the deity Gadong Chökyong [Tib. དགའ་གདོང་ཆོས་སྐྱོང] if it was all right to give salary at under the gomchor and Gadong said it is good. Gungru Khenchen Tenpa Chönphel was the former incarnation of the Gungru Khentrü [Tib. མཁན་སྤྲུལ] who gave the Kangyur transmission just before the revolt. Then after that, among the common monks, the monks who had the special privilge reported to the tratsang saying, "please pay the salary under the gomchor as you did before, if you pay the salary in the chöra, the old system of the asking the permission to the gegö will be ignored [Tib. བརྩི་མེད་རེད]. If this system get ignored, for example, there will be no one in the jikhang to guard it, if there would be theft when all the monks went to the chöra, we can't bear the responsibilty and there will no one to perform the ritual in the jikhang which will make the good old system get undermined and the new syetem will become bad".   

**Q:**  Who advocated the new custom and who were the main ones who objected to it?   

**A:**  At the very beginning I didn't know about the event and I wasn't there. When the quarrel became more intense, a meeting was called for all the common monks and they said it is not okay if some one didn't come, so I went to it. There would be about over 300 monks at the meeting even if the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཚོགས་འདུ] 1. The general name for the various types of Tibetan government assemblies. 2. Any assembly, e.g., the assembly (meeting) of monks in a college.">tsondu</a> was an abbreviated one [Tib. སྟབས་བདེ]. I was not at the previous meeetings and I attened the later one. The events of the change were explained and discussed at the meeting. Then I knew about it. I said at the meeting, "Since the case has been started, now we must resolve the matter well and we must make a report [of our concerns] to the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. གྲྭ་ཚང] A &quot;college&quot; within a monastery, for example, in Drepung Monastery there were four main tratsang: Gomang, Loseling, Deyang and Ngagpa. These tratsang were property owning corporate entities and included monks who were organized into residential dormitories called Khamtsen.">tratsang</a> abbot and get it resolved." Usually the matters in the tratsang would be settled by the abbot.   

**Q:**  Did you report orally or in writing?   

**A:**  Verbally. The abbot was very knowledgeable [and a Mongolian] and excellent in <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. མཚན་ཉིད] Buddhist dialectics. This is taught after the six-year curriculum called düdra.">tsenyi</a>. He had no <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. དགེ་ཕྲུག] 1. Student. 2. Disciple. 3. Commonly the name for monks living with a gegen or teacher. These are more like wards than real disciples.">gidru</a> and was a simple monk. He got abbot suddenly when the Dalai Lama approved him. So he merged with two other <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཤག་ཚང] 1. The household or family of a monk that consisted of multiple monks. 2. The apartment of a monk household.">shagtsang</a>: <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཨ་མདོ] One of the three main Tibetan sub-ethnic areas. It is located in the northeast of the Tibetan Plateau mostly in today&#x27;s Qinghai Province. A person from Amdo is called an Amdowa.">Amdo</a> shagtsang, with a monk nicknamed Huhu and one of his countrymen, an Outer Mongol. Huhu became the abbot's <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. བླ་བྲང] 1. The property/wealth owning corporate entity of an incarnate lama. 2. The property/wealth owning corporate entity of the Panchen Lama.">labrang</a> chandzö and the representative when the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཕྱག་སྦུག] A manager (of estates and endowments) of a monastic college or monastic khamtsen.">chabu</a> held the tsondu. At first, this was not a dispute between the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. བླ་རྒྱུད་པ] A term for the common monks in a monastery (in contrast to the scholar monks who were actively studying the Buddhist doctrine).">lagyüba</a> and <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. དཔེ་ཆ་བ] A monk studying the monastic philosophical curriculum. A scholar monk.">pechawa</a>, but these two close shagtsang mates of the abbot acted cunningly [Tib. མགོ་བདེ་པོ] and instigated the abbot and the pechawa. They told the pechawa monks that if the salary were given at <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཆོས་ར] The special grove (&quot;dharma grove&quot;) in monasteries where monks formally met to practice debating.">chöra</a>, [it was good since] more monks would then come to chöra. There were many pechawa studying tsenyi in chöra and if the salary was given in chöra, it would be very convenient for them to take it and do not need to go to the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. སྒོ་མཆོར] The area outside of the monastic assembly hall that is supported by tall pillars.">gomchor</a>. If the salary is paid in the gomchor, there will be less monks in the chöra. So the pechawa should say that the salary should be paid in the chöra, so the pechawa supported the abbot and insisted that the salary should be paid in the chöra.   

**Q:**  What I don't understand well is that if the lagyüpa go to the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཆོས་ར] The special grove (&quot;dharma grove&quot;) in monasteries where monks formally met to practice debating.">chöra</a> to get the salary, do they have to debate <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. མཚན་ཉིད] Buddhist dialectics. This is taught after the six-year curriculum called düdra.">tsenyi</a> or do they just go and sit there?   

**A:**  They don't need to debate <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. མཚན་ཉིད] Buddhist dialectics. This is taught after the six-year curriculum called düdra.">tsenyi</a> in the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཆོས་ར] The special grove (&quot;dharma grove&quot;) in monasteries where monks formally met to practice debating.">chöra</a> because some of them were <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. དགེ་ཤེས] An advanced degree earned by scholar monks.">geshe</a> who have passed the exam and there were some senior ones and others were the monks who were working in the jikhang etc. So if they go to the chöra to get the salary, only the number of the monks in the chöra will increase.   

**Q:**  Who made the new rule?   

**A:**  I am not sure about it but probably the original one was Kündeling Dzasa Wöser Gyentsen [Tib.འོད་ཟེར་རྒྱལ་མཚན].   

**Q:**  What was he then?   

**A:**  He was a monk from this <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. གྲྭ་ཚང] A &quot;college&quot; within a monastery, for example, in Drepung Monastery there were four main tratsang: Gomang, Loseling, Deyang and Ngagpa. These tratsang were property owning corporate entities and included monks who were organized into residential dormitories called Khamtsen.">tratsang</a> and also <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. རྫ་ས] 1. A high rank in the Tibetan government. 2. A top manager-like official for the labrang of important incarnate lamas, especially those who in the past had served as regents of Tibet.">dzasa</a> of Kündeling.   

**Q:**  Did he have relation with the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཡིག་ཚང] The highest office dealing with monastic and religious affairs in the traditional Tibetan government. It is often called the Ecclesiastic Office. It was headed by 4 fourth rank monk officials called Trunyichemmo. The senior Trunyichemmo was called Ta Lama.">Yigtsang</a>?   

**A:**  No. Then many <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. བླ་རྒྱུད་པ] A term for the common monks in a monastery (in contrast to the scholar monks who were actively studying the Buddhist doctrine).">lagyüba</a> went to the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཡིག་ཚང] The highest office dealing with monastic and religious affairs in the traditional Tibetan government. It is often called the Ecclesiastic Office. It was headed by 4 fourth rank monk officials called Trunyichemmo. The senior Trunyichemmo was called Ta Lama.">Yigtsang</a>. I didn't go with them, but on that day they didn't give any answer. I was called to go to the Yigtsang saying that it will be good to have as many monks as they could go, but I didn't go. It was in winter so the Yigtsang was meeting at Potala. Later, they confronted with the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. དཔེ་ཆ་བ] A monk studying the monastic philosophical curriculum. A scholar monk.">pechawa</a> and there were two factions and they didn't get along well no matter they talked many times. At this time, the Dalai Lama's <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. དགེ་ཤེས] An advanced degree earned by scholar monks.">geshe</a> exam, tsentag [Tib. མཚན་རྟགས]] was about to occur and some monks feared that the lagyüba would make a direct face to face appeal [Tib. གདོང་ཞུ] to the Dalai Lama on this occasions.   

**Q:**  Do you remember the year of the tsentag?   

**A:**  It was quite early. Then an elaborated <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཚོགས་འདུ] 1. The general name for the various types of Tibetan government assemblies. 2. Any assembly, e.g., the assembly (meeting) of monks in a college.">tsondu</a> of Drepung laji met and then summoned representatives from both sides and told the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. བླ་རྒྱུད་པ] A term for the common monks in a monastery (in contrast to the scholar monks who were actively studying the Buddhist doctrine).">lagyüba</a> and <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. དཔེ་ཆ་བ] A monk studying the monastic philosophical curriculum. A scholar monk.">pechawa</a> that no disturbance could be allowed to occur at the time of the Dalai Lama's tshentag. I was at this meeting. The representatives of the two sides said that they cannot assure that nothing will happen. This is not the idea of one person, it is of many persons, so we won't know what will happen. The laji said that this answer is unacceptable. And tonight you have to affix your seals on the plege, [Tib. གན་རྒྱ] to guarantee to that effect. This was for both sides. The pechawa, however left when hearing this without fixing seals and I spoke on behalf of the lagyüba saying, "I am sure that the lagyüba would cause no trouble at the ceremony, but we couldn't fix the seal on the pledge. It is the like the saying, "if a beggar made a plege, the owner of the pledge will be the king's hand" [Tib. འབའ་སྤྲང་པོས་བཞག་ཀྱང།འབའ་བདག་རྒྱལ་པོའི་ཕྱག་རེད] One person would not dare to put the seal for many because the case is for many people. I guarantee that nothing will happen at this time of the Dalai Lama's ceremony, but I can not put the seal. I don't have a seal and I can't take the responsibility to borrow a seal from other people "   

**Q:**  At that time, were you the main representative of the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. བླ་རྒྱུད་པ] A term for the common monks in a monastery (in contrast to the scholar monks who were actively studying the Buddhist doctrine).">lagyüba</a>?   

**A:**  Yes I was. And there were about 14-15 monks with me. I might be the one who openly told that to the laji. I told the common monks that they are not allowed to cause any trouble during the ceremony and you have to abide by the rule and nothing happened at the Dalai Lama's ceremony. After the ceremony, the disturbance on the law case started and we went to the Yigtsng and there was discussion up and down and finally the Office for Performing Additional Rituals, Nangsi Shabphar Lekhung, [Tib. སྣང་སྲིད་ཞབས་འཕར་ལས་ཁུངས] mediated the case.   

**Q:**  What did you say when you went to the Yigtsng and did you go inside the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཡིག་ཚང] The highest office dealing with monastic and religious affairs in the traditional Tibetan government. It is often called the Ecclesiastic Office. It was headed by 4 fourth rank monk officials called Trunyichemmo. The senior Trunyichemmo was called Ta Lama.">Yigtsang</a>?   

**A:**  I heard that there were many monks when they went to the Yigtsang.   

**Q:**  You were not there, right?   

**A:**  Yes. I don't know how many people went there.   

**Q:**  How many times did they go?   

**A:**  Probably, it was only once or twice.   

**Q:**  Did they talk to them or did they submit the written petition?   

**A:**  They might have talked. At that time, they didn't submit the petition. And then the big disturbance was about to start because the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. བླ་རྒྱུད་པ] A term for the common monks in a monastery (in contrast to the scholar monks who were actively studying the Buddhist doctrine).">lagyüba</a> and the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. དཔེ་ཆ་བ] A monk studying the monastic philosophical curriculum. A scholar monk.">pechawa</a> confronted. Then we were called to the Nangsi Shabphar Lekhung which is a new office set up on top of the Shingra, [Tib. ཤིང་ར] in the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཇོ་ཁང] A most famous temple in Lhasa that houses a holy statue of the Buddha. It is often used to mean the Tsuglagang Temple of which it is a part.">Jokhang</a> to perform the ritual to avoid the obsticles on the Dalai Lama;s life safety. Nangsi is the name of the hall where the office was held. In <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. སྒོ་མང] One of the large colleges in Drepung Monastery.">Gomang</a>, we had 8 <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཆོས་ར] The special grove (&quot;dharma grove&quot;) in monasteries where monks formally met to practice debating.">chöra</a> in a year; 4 monthly chöra, dachö, [Tib. ཟླ་ཆོས] two 15 days, jonga chöra, [Tib. བཅོ་ལྔ་ཆིས་ར] and two 20 days chöra, nyishu chöra, [Tib. ཉི་ཤུ་ཆོས་ར]. In the beginning, the laji then proposed that the salary for the half of the 8 chöra would be given in the chöra and half in the Gomchor. They said that it is impossible to be satisfied in the law case, but it should be done that both sides would not get embarrassed. We, the common monks said no. There is no custom for this. We want to abide by the old custom. Like this, the laji couldn't settle the case.   

**Q:**  Did the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. དཔེ་ཆ་བ] A monk studying the monastic philosophical curriculum. A scholar monk.">pechawa</a> agree?   

**A:**  I don't know what the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. དཔེ་ཆ་བ] A monk studying the monastic philosophical curriculum. A scholar monk.">pechawa</a> said about this.   

**Q:**  At that time, what was the position of the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཕྱག་སྦུག] A manager (of estates and endowments) of a monastic college or monastic khamtsen.">chabu</a> such as the nicknamed, "the tiger with torn mouth" Takharel, [Tib.སྟག་ཁ་རལ] ?   

**A:**  Takharel was not in Drepung then. There were 2 <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཕྱག་སྦུག] A manager (of estates and endowments) of a monastic college or monastic khamtsen.">chabu</a> who supported the abbot, but most were neutral. In this office, there were 2 <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. དྲུང་རྩིས] The drunyichemmo and the tsipön.">drungtsi</a>; <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. རྣམ་གསལ་གླིང] The family name of a well-known aristocratic lay official.">Namseling</a> and Bumthang [Tib. འབུམ་ཐང] and <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. བླ་ཕྱག] 1. The abbreviation of bla brang phyag mdzod, a major treasury/supply office that was located on the second floor of the Tsuglagang Temple and collected taxes annually from various parts of Tibet. 2. A monastic official/manager who worked for the Labrang of the abbots or incarnate lamas. For example, in Loseling College in Drepung, the Laja worked for the abbot who appointed him.">Laja</a> Dumra, [Tib. ལྡུམ་ར] from the laja office and a representative from each of the three great monastic seats and the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. རྒྱུད་སྟོད] The Upper Tantric Monastic College in Lhasa.">Gyüdö</a> and <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. རྒྱུད་སྨད] The Lower Tantric Monastic College in Lhasa.">Gyümey</a> and also a few other aristocrat. There was much discussion back and forth, and in the end it came up with the same decision as the laji had offered. But, we told the Nangsi Shabphar Lekhung, "although we cannot agree with the desicion to get half of the salary form the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. སྒོ་མཆོར] The area outside of the monastic assembly hall that is supported by tall pillars.">gomchor</a> and the half from the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཆོས་ར] The special grove (&quot;dharma grove&quot;) in monasteries where monks formally met to practice debating.">chöra</a> and we also did not adhere to the jali's order. But this time, since we have recieved the mediation from the the Nangsi Shabphar Lekhung which is responsible with the life safety of the Dalai Lama, as far as we representatives are concerned, we will agree with the mediation, but we don't know in detail whether the common monks will agree or not, anyway we will tell the monks. Then the office issued a huge mediation paper, [Tib. འདུམ་ཁྲ] to each side. We were told to bring the mediation paper after two days.   

**Q:**  Did they issue the mediation paper on that day?   

**A:**  No. Then they told us to come after several days to get the mediation paper and then we went there and the other side was also there. It was all the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. དཔེ་ཆ་བ] A monk studying the monastic philosophical curriculum. A scholar monk.">pechawa</a> who absolutely refused to agree to this mediation from the Nangsi Shabphar Lekhung. When the office was about to issue the mediation paper, we knew about this before, therefore I prepared for the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཁ་བཏགས] A Tibetan ceremonial scarf given to lamas, visitors, etc.">khata</a> and when they called I actually had a khata in my pouch. Then when we went to them, I straightened out my monk's shawl and then put the khata Ashe on the monk's shawl, and we received the written mediation paper on it. Our opponents did not have khata and just revived it on the monk's shawl. They gave the written mediation to each party and we promised to return it to Nangsi Shabphar Lekhung in 3 days. During this time, all the pechawa looked at it and we also looked at it. Then we gave it to the 16 <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཁང་ཚན] A monastic residential unit in which monks from specific geographic areas lived. These were corporate entities with property and internal officials. Some large khamtsen had smaller subordinate units called mi tshan. Khamtsen were part of tratsang (colleges). For example, Hamdong Khamtsen was part of Gomang College in Drepung Monastery.">khamtsen</a> and telling them to read it and not to keep it too long, since it has to go around. At the same time, the senior monks had meetings and discussed about it. While doing so there was a lot of discussions, some said yes and some said no, but in due course, we decided to agree to listen to the written mediation.   

**Q:**  How many senior monks were there when you brought and discussed about the paper to the monastery?   

**A:**  Basically about 4-5 seniors.   

**Q:**  You were the main leader, right?   

**A:**  Yes.   

**Q:**  How many people went with you to the Nangsi Shabphar Lekhung?   

**A:**  An <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཨ་མདོ] One of the three main Tibetan sub-ethnic areas. It is located in the northeast of the Tibetan Plateau mostly in today&#x27;s Qinghai Province. A person from Amdo is called an Amdowa.">Amdo</a> called Chönphel Tsültrem [Tib.ཆོས་འཕེལ་ཚུལ་ཁྲིམས] who was among the volunteers almost as same as me. I spoke more frankly, [Tib. གསངས་པོ] than him, but he was braver than me. We were the two main heads of the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. བླ་རྒྱུད་པ] A term for the common monks in a monastery (in contrast to the scholar monks who were actively studying the Buddhist doctrine).">lagyüba</a> faction.   

**Q:**  How old were you then?   

**A:**  I must be about 40 years old. I was imprisoned when I was 42. We brought the mediation paper back to the Nangsi Shabphar Lekhung in the afternoon after two days ready to affix our seals. We said, although agreeing to this will harm the discipline of the monastery, due to the Dalai Lama's office we agree. So we gave the agreement back on the 3rd day after the initial meeting saying we agree to its terms. They said "thank you. This is good. If the monks agree to get along, that is happiness among the monks." and took it from us. After us the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. དཔེ་ཆ་བ] A monk studying the monastic philosophical curriculum. A scholar monk.">pechawa</a> came and said we will not accept the mediation at all.   

**Q:**  Who were the main leaders of the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. དཔེ་ཆ་བ] A monk studying the monastic philosophical curriculum. A scholar monk.">pechawa</a>?   

**A:**  There were the following people; karam kyorpon, [Tib. bka' ram skyor dpopn], <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. བླ་བྲང] 1. The property/wealth owning corporate entity of an incarnate lama. 2. The property/wealth owning corporate entity of the Panchen Lama.">labrang</a> chandzö Huhu, the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཕྱག་སྦུག] A manager (of estates and endowments) of a monastic college or monastic khamtsen.">chabu</a> Samlo Dreba Dorje [Tib. བགྲེས་པ་རྡོར་རྗེ] and Shongpai Yeshe [Tib. གཞོང་པའ྄ི་ཡེ་ཤེས], etc. Those were the main ones.   

**Q:**  What was the abbot's name?   

**A:**  His name was Kelsang Legden [Tib.སྐལ་བཟང་ལེགས་ལྡན]. He was a Outter Mongolian.   

**Q:**  At that time, was there any idea by the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. དཔེ་ཆ་བ] A monk studying the monastic philosophical curriculum. A scholar monk.">pechawa</a> that they could get more salary if few monks went to <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཆོས་ར] The special grove (&quot;dharma grove&quot;) in monasteries where monks formally met to practice debating.">chöra</a>?   

**A:**  No. There was no difference with respect to the amount of salary they would get. Now our dispute was becoming bad like a bitter and volatile chang. Since the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. དཔེ་ཆ་བ] A monk studying the monastic philosophical curriculum. A scholar monk.">pechawa</a> refused to agree to even the mediation. Now we went back to the monastery and we thought we should have new discussions as a result of their refusal. So far we went through all kinds of official channels even carrying a <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཁ་བཏགས] A Tibetan ceremonial scarf given to lamas, visitors, etc.">khata</a>, but to no avail. Now we have to make things come to a conclusion. The main backstage supporters of the pechawa were: Kündeling Dzasa Wöser Gyaltsen, Tsipön <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. རྣམ་གསལ་གླིང] The family name of a well-known aristocratic lay official.">Namseling</a> and Drönyer <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཆེན་མོ] 1. Abbr. of the name of the Dalai Lama&#x27;s Lord Chamberlain (Drönyerchemmo). 2. Title for the highest status craftsmen in traditional Tibet.">chemmo</a> Phala Thuten Wönden [Tib.ཐུབ་བསྟན་འོད་ལྡན] were mahjong playmates, but we didn't have any such behind the scenes supporters. We had no backers. We were just plain monks. Now we thought we have to take a risky course of action, [Tib. ཡ་ཡུད] but the above mentioned people who were behind the pechawa sensed they were not going to succeed and then suddenly they asked the Dalai Lama to do the divination about this case. First they told the Dalai lama that the salary used to be at Gomchor now they are giving at <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཆོས་ར] The special grove (&quot;dharma grove&quot;) in monasteries where monks formally met to practice debating.">chöra</a> and this bring more monks to chöra so please do the divination as to where the salary should be paid. The Dalai lama divination said, "If it is benefiting for the livelihood of the simple monks who is abiding by their vows and being contented with inferior food, monk's robe and housing and liked to meditate, you can do what you are doing now" [Tib. འཕགས་པའི་རིགས་བཞི་ལ་ཆོག་ཤེས་པའི་གྲྭ་རྐྱང་ཆོས་ལ་ཚུལ་བཞིན་སྤྱོད་པ་རྣམས་ཀྱི་ཆོས་རྒྱུན་འཚོ་བར་ཕན་སླེབས་ཡོད་ན་ད་ལྟའི་ད་ག་བྱས་ན་འགྲིག་གི་རེད] and he told them to perform many shabetn. They explained this to the Dalai lama very beautifully, but then later I exposed this.   

**Q:**  Is there one <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཆོས་ར] The special grove (&quot;dharma grove&quot;) in monasteries where monks formally met to practice debating.">chöra</a>?   

**A:**  No there are two. A winter and summer place.   

**Q:**  Was their objective to have all 3,000 monks to come to the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཆོས་ར] The special grove (&quot;dharma grove&quot;) in monasteries where monks formally met to practice debating.">chöra</a> at one time.   

**A:**  No, that is not their objective. We, the common monks want the old rule because we have lots of monks with special privilegses. They can request for the permission to the abbot only once in his 6 years term and once to the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. དགེ་སྐོས] The main disciplinary official in a monastic college (tratsang).">gegö</a> in his 6 months term to miss the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཆོས་ར] The special grove (&quot;dharma grove&quot;) in monasteries where monks formally met to practice debating.">chöra</a> by paying 2 <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཞོ] A unit in the traditional Tibetan currency system. 10 sho equaled to 1 sang and 10 karma equaled one sho.">sho</a> or 5 karma. But under the new system this will be eliminated, therefore, we want the salary to be paid in the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. སྒོ་མཆོར] The area outside of the monastic assembly hall that is supported by tall pillars.">gomchor</a>. As for the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. དཔེ་ཆ་བ] A monk studying the monastic philosophical curriculum. A scholar monk.">pechawa</a>, the outward reason they gave for the change is that there will be more monks in the chöra, but that is not true. The only benefit is that they don't have to come to the gomchor to get the salary after the chöra is over.   

**Q:**  Wouldn't it be easy to give salary to the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. དཔེ་ཆ་བ] A monk studying the monastic philosophical curriculum. A scholar monk.">pechawa</a> in <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཆོས་ར] The special grove (&quot;dharma grove&quot;) in monasteries where monks formally met to practice debating.">chöra</a> and the others in the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. སྒོ་མཆོར] The area outside of the monastic assembly hall that is supported by tall pillars.">gomchor</a>?   

**A:**  No, then it would become two unreasonable systems and it wouldn't work.   

**Q:**  If you do this, would there be the danger that some monks would get double salary?   

**A:**  Yes, there could be. Some would go to the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཆོས་ར] The special grove (&quot;dharma grove&quot;) in monasteries where monks formally met to practice debating.">chöra</a> to collect the salary and then run to <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. སྒོ་མཆོར] The area outside of the monastic assembly hall that is supported by tall pillars.">gomchor</a> to collect it again and it is hard to guess because there were many monks. Even the mediator didn't tell us to do that. Actaully, there is nothing to benefit the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. དཔེ་ཆ་བ] A monk studying the monastic philosophical curriculum. A scholar monk.">pechawa</a> on their study etc if the salary is paid in the chöra. The only benefit was that they didn't have to go to gomchor to collect the salary after the chöra.   

**Q:**  In case, it was decided to pay the salary in the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཆོས་ར] The special grove (&quot;dharma grove&quot;) in monasteries where monks formally met to practice debating.">chöra</a>, would all the common monks including the monks having the privilege and seniors have to go to the chöra to get the salary and stay there till the chöra is over?   

**A:**  Yes. All have to go to the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཆོས་ར] The special grove (&quot;dharma grove&quot;) in monasteries where monks formally met to practice debating.">chöra</a> and then come back home. If you didn't go, there is no salary. The enchöndze could get the salary share no matter the salary is paid from any where.   

**Q:**  How long do monks have to stay in the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཆོས་ར] The special grove (&quot;dharma grove&quot;) in monasteries where monks formally met to practice debating.">chöra</a>?   

**A:**  Some are long some are short. The <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཆོས་ར] The special grove (&quot;dharma grove&quot;) in monasteries where monks formally met to practice debating.">chöra</a> started at 3 a.m morning, afternoon and evening and the salary is always given at the midday chöra. Kündeling Dzasa was the backer of the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. དཔེ་ཆ་བ] A monk studying the monastic philosophical curriculum. A scholar monk.">pechawa</a> and he was involved in the case and he told that it will be good to pay the salary in the chöra. Before the Nangsi Shabphar Lekhung called both sides, they were called by <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. རྣམ་གསལ་གླིང] The family name of a well-known aristocratic lay official.">Namseling</a> to his house in Lhasa and he went through the motions of mediating amd he called the reprersentatives of <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. སྒོ་མང] One of the large colleges in Drepung Monastery.">Gomang</a> Tratsang to his house located near Ramoche. There were about 60-70 representatives at that time. There were representatives of enchöndze and from the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. དགེ་ཤེས] An advanced degree earned by scholar monks.">geshe</a> who finished their exam and from the 16 <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཁང་ཚན] A monastic residential unit in which monks from specific geographic areas lived. These were corporate entities with property and internal officials. Some large khamtsen had smaller subordinate units called mi tshan. Khamtsen were part of tratsang (colleges). For example, Hamdong Khamtsen was part of Gomang College in Drepung Monastery.">khamtsen</a>, from the senior monks and from the two sides. We sat on carpets set up around the room. And tea was served. Then Namseling sat in the middle on a bed frame, [Tib. སྒྲོམ] and first he spoke beautifully and then at a certain point, he talked about asking the divination and then about taming, [Tib. གཅུན] the common monks. And he spoke in a way that hurt feelings of the common monks. Then he read the Dalai Lama's divination. He read it, and told us, "you people know how to read. Then take it and read". But nobody took it from him.   

**Q:**  Did you know about the divination in advance?   

**A:**  No we didn't. Only that day. <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. རྣམ་གསལ་གླིང] The family name of a well-known aristocratic lay official.">Namseling</a> said, this is Dalai Lama's divination, will you obey him or not? At the same time, he put the divination on the table by his left hand. Among the representative, some spoke about short parts of the early history but no one talked openly about the real issue, [Tib. དམར་དམར་དིང་དིང].   

**Q:**  It was difficult to go against the Dalai Lama's order, right?   

**A:**  Yes. When everyone finished talking, I was sitting right at the end of the row and then I spoke, "I am something to report to your Highness Kungö, [Tib. མི་དབང་ཆེན་མོ]. This case of the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. སྒོ་མང] One of the large colleges in Drepung Monastery.">Gomang</a> Tratsang, in the eyes of some one who is not acquainted with it, it looks like beggars not friendly over eating food. But that is not what it is. According to the discipline of the great monastic seats, Everyone from top to bottom, top-shengo, middle-abbot and gegö-- all talk about the continuation of the old good system of rules and discipline and not to have the new system become bad, [Tib. སྔ་སྲོལ་བཟང་པོ་མ་ཉམས་པ། ཕྱི་སྲོལ་ངན་པ་མ་ཆགས་པ]. The principle of the discipline of the great monastic seats is, "It's better to scatter the monasteries of the 4 directions, than to deteriorate the discipline of the great monastic seats" [Tib.གདན་སའི་སྒྲིགས་ལམ་ཉམ་བ་ལས། མཐའ་བཞི་དགོན་སྡེ་འཐོར་བ་དགའ] "It's better to be born as butcher of the three worlds than destroy a little of the golden discipline". [Tib. སྒྲིག་ལམ་གསེར་ཙམ་ཉམས་པ་ལས། སྟོང་གསུམ་ཤན་པར་སྐྱེས་པ་དགའ] But now our Gomang Tratsang's good old discipline has been declined. Giving salary at <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. སྒོ་མཆོར] The area outside of the monastic assembly hall that is supported by tall pillars.">gomchor</a> was originated by Gungru Khenchen Temba Chönpel according to the divination of the deity Ratö Chökyong. That is what I believe it is. The one who wanted the salary at <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཆོས་ར] The special grove (&quot;dharma grove&quot;) in monasteries where monks formally met to practice debating.">chöra</a> was the one who violated the order and insulted the lama and the deity Gadong Chögyong. So today, your highness told us whether we will obey the Dalai Lama's order or not. If anyone in the 13 areas of Tibet populated with 10,000 household, [Tib. ཁྲི་སྐོར་བཅུ་གསུམ]] thinks rationally, nobody can dare not obeying the Dala lama. Anyone born in the religious land Tibet, he must obey the Dalai Lama. Today we are not obeying Dalai lama 's divination because this divination is not done according to the Buddhist custom, but according to the Brahmin custom, [Tib. ཕྱི་རོལ་མུ་སྟེགས་པ]. The law case arose in the 11th month last year, but the divination was done just in the 5th month of this year. That is why I say it is not according to Buddhist custom but Brahmin custom. Whether we are laymen or simple monk, the usual procedure is to have the divination done first and do the job later. We Buddhist don't have the custom od doing the work and ask for the divination. Furthermore, the one who asked Dalai Lama's divination is not because he believes in him and respects him, but is to trick, [Tib. དབུ་འཁོར་ཞུ] the Dalai Lama and also for the purpose of suppressing us". When I said this, everyone kept quiet. No one said a word. So I said, "Today I stop here." And then as soon as I said this, <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. རྣམ་གསལ་གླིང] The family name of a well-known aristocratic lay official.">Namseling</a> his face became so red and said nothing for awhile and nobody said anything. And then finally Namseling, said, "Today I have this much to say, if it's okay or not, give me your reply day after tomorrow." Then everyone kept silent and went away. The next day, I didn't go personally, but we sent someone telling him [Namseling] they do not agree.   

**Q:**  How many people were there when you discussed about what <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. རྣམ་གསལ་གླིང] The family name of a well-known aristocratic lay official.">Namseling</a> said?   

**A:**  There were 6-7 monks in Lhasa including me and then we discussed it on that night and sent the reply on the next day.   

**Q:**  Did people try to persuade you to agree?   

**A:**  No, after that the Nangsi Shabphar Lekhung did the mediation unsuccessfully and <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. རྣམ་གསལ་གླིང] The family name of a well-known aristocratic lay official.">Namseling</a>'s was unsuccessful and then the people concerned with this case worried that we will kill the abbot. Like in the past the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. སེ་ར་བྱེས] The Jey (Je) College of Sera Monastery.">Sera Jey</a> abbot was murdered. And in fact, the common monks were implying to kill the abbot. And at that time the abbot was staying in Lhasa. He didn't dare to stay in the monastery.   

**Q:**  Among the common monks, was there a plan to kill the abbot ?   

**A:**  Among the common monks there was no plan at that time; but later there was a plan. At that time, the Great Autumn Retreat, tonchö <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཆེན་མོ] 1. Abbr. of the name of the Dalai Lama&#x27;s Lord Chamberlain (Drönyerchemmo). 2. Title for the highest status craftsmen in traditional Tibet.">chenmo</a>, [Tib. སྟོན་ཆོས་ཆེན་མོ] was about to occur (on 3rd of 8th month). It was about one month. During the monthly <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཆོས་ར] The special grove (&quot;dharma grove&quot;) in monasteries where monks formally met to practice debating.">chöra</a>, dachö the abbot couldn't come since he ran away and dared not return. At this point, karam kyorpön and <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཕྱག་མཛོད] A senior manager/treasurer of an aristocratic or monastic estate, or the senior manager/treasurer of an aristocratic family or a monastic unit. Generally chandzö handled both internal and external issues and were considered higher in power and status than nyerpa (stewards), who typically only handled the storerooms.">chandzö</a> Huhu and chandzö Samlo dreba called 16 <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཁང་ཚན] A monastic residential unit in which monks from specific geographic areas lived. These were corporate entities with property and internal officials. Some large khamtsen had smaller subordinate units called mi tshan. Khamtsen were part of tratsang (colleges). For example, Hamdong Khamtsen was part of Gomang College in Drepung Monastery.">khamtsen</a> to have a meeting at <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. སྒོ་མང] One of the large colleges in Drepung Monastery.">Gomang</a> Khangsar in Lhasa. They said, "it is necessary for the abbot do return to monastery for chöra but on the other hand it is a danger to his life. "What should be done?" The 16 khamtsen leaders met and these three put this question before them. I was there also with a few monks from the common monks. I said, "the abbot should be invited. Without the abbot, we can't have chöra in the great monastic seat. If he comes back to monastery and Samlo Dreba asked us what to do about the danger to his life, we cannot guarantee whether or not there will be danger to his life. We the common monks, we guarantee we are not taking up arrow, spear, knife to harm him. The saying that the abbots life will be in no danger, does this mean that the abbot is still be alive for ever ". [laughter] Then we left and the 16 khamtsen meeting ended. This meeting took place in Lhasa. Then we all went back to the monastery. Then, the 30th day of the 10th month was the anniversary of the 13th Dalai Lama's death. On that day, in the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. གྲྭ་ཚང] A &quot;college&quot; within a monastery, for example, in Drepung Monastery there were four main tratsang: Gomang, Loseling, Deyang and Ngagpa. These tratsang were property owning corporate entities and included monks who were organized into residential dormitories called Khamtsen.">tratsang</a> there is a lot of salary given by the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཕྱག་སྦུག] A manager (of estates and endowments) of a monastic college or monastic khamtsen.">chabu</a>, <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. གཉེར་ཚང] 1. Storehouse. 2. Steward, person in charge of a storehouse. 3. A monastic official in charge of storerooms.">nyertsang</a> and three ngünyer. So we had discussion 2 days before the salary and decided to go to the houses of the people who give the salary and request them to pay the salary at the Gomchor. It will not be okay if any of you pay the salary in the chöra. At the same time, we told the common monks that nobody is allowed to go to the chöra to get the salary. Monks have to go to chöra, but not on the particular day when salary is given. If you are in chöra when salary is given, then nobody is allowed to take it and you should come back to gomchor. If we wait at Gomchor and they don't give us salary, then it is a different situation. Then on the 30th, all the salary was given at the Gomchor as usual. Later on, all the persons who gave salary found it was difficult to decide where to give. Then we, the common monks had a new meeting to talk about future plans. Up to now everything has gone fine, no big problems [like fights], but from now on, we must have a clear goal and achieve this goal, we must be united as one man and we should put the seal on the pledge by passing the seal around, [Tib. ཐེལ་རྩེ་ལག་སྐོར]. So if anyone disagrees, then say frankly. Up to know, whatever we did, we did not get the results. We took <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཁ་བཏགས] A Tibetan ceremonial scarf given to lamas, visitors, etc.">khata</a> in our hands and got no results to settle the issue. And among our own party, there are all kinds of people. It is possible someone will tell our secrets to other people, but that doesn't matter, after all this is the business of many people and can't keep it secret. From now on we must be united as one and then we put seal on the plan.   

**Q:**  How many people at that time?   

**A:**  About 300 people. Then in <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. གྲྭ་ཚང] A &quot;college&quot; within a monastery, for example, in Drepung Monastery there were four main tratsang: Gomang, Loseling, Deyang and Ngagpa. These tratsang were property owning corporate entities and included monks who were organized into residential dormitories called Khamtsen.">tratsang</a>'s standing committee there were nine people: 5 <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཕྱག་སྦུག] A manager (of estates and endowments) of a monastic college or monastic khamtsen.">chabu</a> or the bugpa laja, [Tib. སྦུག་པ་བླ་པྱག], 2 clerk, 2 uchö. From among these 2 were abbot's <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཤག་ཚང] 1. The household or family of a monk that consisted of multiple monks. 2. The apartment of a monk household.">shagtsang</a> and 1 was tratsang umdze. They are the ones who always met together. Then my partner, Chapai Tsültrim [Tib. ཆ་པའི་འཚུལ་ཁྲིམ] proposed that we catch all three [abbot's shagtsang] and beat them severely with switches. And then throw them out of the monk's order, [Tib. སྐྱིད་སྦུག་ཕུད]. I said that is not right. We do not have the right to beat them or kick them out. This is not right. We have something else (problems) to tell them. We will go to <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. སྒོ་མང] One of the large colleges in Drepung Monastery.">Gomang</a> Tratsang's Rabsel, [Tib. རབ་གསལ] [the room with big windows] where the 9 people are having a meeting. We go there and talk with them and if they acknowledge their mistakes, that is okay, if not we will throw them out of the window of Rabsel. This is my plan. That day we went in and our common monks were packed in everywhere, about 100-200 of our monks.   

**Q:**  At that time, had the abbot come?   

**A:**  Yes. Just before that, the common monks said they wanted to kill the Mongolian abbot. And they said that Mongolian abbot was no good as was the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. སེ་ར་བྱེས] The Je College in Sera Monastery.">Sera Je</a> Mongolian abbot. Everyone was saying the same thing.
