Probably, one <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. ཏམ་ཀ] A unit in the traditional Tibetan currency system that was equal to 4 sang.">tranka</span> was enough to register their name and they were in the tobtsang. Then there were fines if you fail to show up at jump practices and compeitions and the leader would get this for his use. Then sometimes they pool money from each dobdo for the jump or other things.

So one of the main reasons for their elimination was their fighting at jumping place. Later, I heard that there were fights when they jump and there wasn'r any killing. When the Dali Lama was giving audience when he was taking his Pharhin, [Tib. ཕར་ཕྱིན] Grade, some <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. ལྡབ་ལྡོབ] A mildly deviant type of fighting or &quot;punk&quot; monk who engaged in fighting and other unusual behaviors for monks in traditional Tibet&#x27;s large monasteries.">dobdo</span> came in their dobdo's dress and the Dali Lama asked what kind of clothes are those. And he was told about dobdo and they have <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. ལྟོ་ཚང] 1. The club of the Dobdos. 2. A group of people eating together.">tobtsang</span> etc. So the Dali Lama said that the monks wearing all kinds of clothes like these is not good and if they jump and do those things, this will harm the Buddhism, so we have to stop this. And that is how it occurred.   

**Q:**  Did the laji stop this or the <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. ཡིག་ཚང] The highest office dealing with monastic and religious affairs in the traditional Tibetan government. It is often called the Ecclesiastic Office. It was headed by 4 fourth rank monk officials called Trunyichemmo. The senior Trunyichemmo was called Ta Lama.">Yigtsang</span>?

**Q:**  When was this in reference to 1959?   

**A:**  I think it was 6-7 years before it.   

**Q:**  At that time, had the Chinese arrived?   

**A:**  Probably, there were <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. ལྡབ་ལྡོབ] A mildly deviant type of fighting or &quot;punk&quot; monk who engaged in fighting and other unusual behaviors for monks in traditional Tibet&#x27;s large monasteries.">dobdo</span> just after the Chinese arrival.

**A:**  Yes they did, but secretly. They didn't dare to set up the organization conspiciously. In the <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. ལས་སྣེ] The general name for all monastic officials.">lene</span> also knew that there was the <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. ལྡབ་ལྡོབ] A mildly deviant type of fighting or &quot;punk&quot; monk who engaged in fighting and other unusual behaviors for monks in traditional Tibet&#x27;s large monasteries.">dobdo</span> organization and they would go to the parks to jump in grous.   

**Q:**  You were <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. འབྲུ་གཉེར] A steward (nyerpa) in charge of grain.">drunyer</span> for 15 years, were there small incidents or law cases like the family got extinct or exhausted [Tib. སྟོངས]? Please tell us.   

**A:**  There were several household that became exhausted. If a household became exhausted, then according to the custom called "joined chains "jagthag langdrel" [Tib. ལྕགས་ཐག་ལག་སྦྲེལ], if a family became exhausted, then their debt gets divided between the other families under the same <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. དཔོན་པོ, མངའ་བདག] 1. A manorial estate holder. 2. Chief of an area.">lord</span> who took the loans at the same time. Usually if a person takes a loan, he has to have a guarantor. But in the villages, we made the pledge for all of the <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. མི་སེར] A term that can mean serf/bound subject as well as citizen, depending on context. For example, the miser of a lord would connote the bound subjects of that lord, whereas the miser of Tibet would connote citizens of Tibet.">miser</span> under the same lord in the sort where all were made responsible for the other's loans (as guarators). There may by 40-50 households under one seal of the joint pledge all acting as guarantor of the other. So if one ran away, then the debt is divided among the others. The new debt and the old is divided among the others.   

**Q:**  If 30 out of 50 families take loan, then the loan pledge is jointly put for the 30 households in one gengya, right?   

**A:**  So if some one became exhausted, then just those 30 are responsible.   

**Q:**  Who would put the seal on it? Was it the <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. རྒན་བོ] A village headman. Such headmen were responsible for organizing the different households to pay the village&#x27;s taxes in-kind and labor. They also played a role in settling minor disputes and were the link between the village and the higher authorities. In some areas they were elected by the village households, while in others the position was hereditary or appointed.">gembo</span>?   

**A:**  Whoever among the debtors in the joined pledge can put the seal.   

**Q:**  Was it an iron seal?   

**A:**  Yes, when they come to take loans they bring their seal.   

**A:**  Can this be done by one's own <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. མི་སེར] A term that can mean serf/bound subject as well as citizen, depending on context. For example, the miser of a lord would connote the bound subjects of that lord, whereas the miser of Tibet would connote citizens of Tibet.">miser</span> only?   

**A:**  No, it can be of anyone's <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. མི་སེར] A term that can mean serf/bound subject as well as citizen, depending on context. For example, the miser of a lord would connote the bound subjects of that lord, whereas the miser of Tibet would connote citizens of Tibet.">miser</span>. But it has to be only one <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. དཔོན་པོ, མངའ་བདག] 1. A manorial estate holder. 2. Chief of an area.">lord</span>'s miser on the joint pledge who were from the same place. If one individual come for loans from other places then he must have a guarantor. Sometimes there are 3 or 4 people who come to take joint loan and the jagthag langdrel is done. Usually, jagthag langdrel is done above three persons.   

**Q:**    

**Q:**  Where is the authority to do this come from? Was this written on the document?   

**A:**  It became kind of custom from the early times.   

**Q:**  Can the other people in the jagthag langdrel say "no,I won't pay for the other persons"?   

**A:**  No, once it was an old custom they, they have to pay.   

**Q:**  Does this include both old and new loans?   

**A:**  Yes yes.   

**Q:**  If the old loan is like sevaral thousands of <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. ཁལ] A traditional volume measurement used for measuring grain in traditional Tibetan society. Sizes of this unit varied somewhat, but the official government khe (called mkhar ru or bstan dzin mkha ru) weighed about 28-31 pounds for barley. It was used to convey the size of fields. For example, a field said to be 10 khe in size meant that 10 khe of seed could be sown on that field.">khe</span>, was it still divided?   

**A:**  Yes it is. But this doesn't happen often. There were just a few households who became exhausted. Mostly when it happened, we divide the debt. But if someone takes over the land and the house of the exhausted family, then the new person gets the land, the tax and the outstanding debts and he have to pay it.   

**Q:**  Did this happen during your time?   

**A:**  Yes, there were few household became exhausted.   

**Q:**  Did you divide the loan or you handed over the loan to the person who got the land?   

**A:**  Mostly, the loan was divided and there were also some loans handed over to the person who got the land.   

**Q:**  During your <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. འབྲུ་གཉེར] A steward (nyerpa) in charge of grain.">drunyer</span> terms, did some person insist saying I can't give back the loan and caused trouble for you?   

**Q:**  Some person do insist saying I can't give back the loan because they didn't really have the means to pay it and they do not request to do the domthag chö for the remaining loan. But if some one shows his back, [Tib. སྒལ་པ་བསྟན] which means act rebellious and refuse to pay the loan, since we are from one of the big <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. གྲྭ་ཚང] A &quot;college&quot; within a monastery, for example, in Drepung Monastery there were four main tratsang: Gomang, Loseling, Deyang and Ngagpa. These tratsang were property owning corporate entities and included monks who were organized into residential dormitories called Khamtsen.">tratsang</span>, we can beat them up. In my time, I didn't beat people much and I have had experience of telling one household,"unless you pay the debt well, I will tie you to a pillar in the house and leave you there". I've also tied him to the pillar in the house a little bit, but then the <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. མི་སེར] A term that can mean serf/bound subject as well as citizen, depending on context. For example, the miser of a lord would connote the bound subjects of that lord, whereas the miser of Tibet would connote citizens of Tibet.">miser</span> neighbors would come and plead to let him go saying, he'll pay the debt. And then I've let them go.   

**Q:**  Had anyone really showed his back and refused to pay the loan in your time?   

**A:**  Yes.   

**Q:**  Are there fights between different lenders over who will get the loan paid first?   

**A:**  No, I haven't had that happened between <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. བློ་གསལ་གླིང] One of the main colleges in Drepung Monastery.">Loseling</span> and Gomang.   

**Q:**  What about the dzugshing disputes?   

**A:**  Yes there were, but I have not had any of these.   

**Q:**  Was your <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. 1. ཤག, 2. ཞག] 1. The apartment/room of a monk. 2. The butter fat that coagulates on the top of butter-tea when the tea is left to sit for some time. If the tea had been made with a lot of butter, this layer could be thick enough to scoop off and save to later sell or eat separately. The senior monks are usually served tea with a lot of shag.">shag</span> the same size as now when you were small?   

**A:**  No it was very small. About half size of my present shag. Only a size of one pillar. Outside of that, there was a kitchen and room was inside the kitchen.   

**Q:**  Was there any special reason for making all the 3 sons monks?   

**A:**  No special reason. We had a big family and there were many children from the same father. And my father made all the sons monks and it was all done at one time. There were three daughters and later he made two daughters nuns, leaving one to get <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. མག་པ] A groom who moved matrilocally at marriage to the household of his bride and became part of her household. In Tibet, the normal custom was the opposite, i.e., women moved to the households of their husband at marriage.">magba</span>, but she died early. There was also an elder brother who had a wife and a daughter and that daughter took a magba and she held the family.   

**Q:**  By making three of you monks, there wasn't any help for the household, right?   

**A:**  Yes. Not at all. They helped us out with enough <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. རྩམ་པ] The traditional Tibetan staple food that consists of grain that is roasted (popped), usually in sand, and then ground into a flour.">tsampa</span> in the shag.   

**Q:**  So your household's living condition was okay, right?

A scholar monk.">pechawa</span>, right? When you were sitting in chöra, what do you do? Did you just sit there idle? [TN Note: the following part is not in the tape]   

**A:**  I just sat there. I didn't understand anything.   

**Q:**  Were there special seating arrangements?   

**A:**  Each grade had its own place. There were 16 grade. After this, there were joint prayers and at this time all sat together and did the prayers.   

**Q:**  What grain salary did you get in <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. སྒོ་མང] One of the large colleges in Drepung Monastery.">Gomang</span>?   

**A:**  From Trasang: in the early times we got 1 <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. ཁལ] A traditional volume measurement used for measuring grain in traditional Tibetan society. Sizes of this unit varied somewhat, but the official government khe (called mkhar ru or bstan dzin mkha ru) weighed about 28-31 pounds for barley. It was used to convey the size of fields. For example, a field said to be 10 khe in size meant that 10 khe of seed could be sown on that field.">khe</span> (later 3 khe)--no special time to give it, usually they tried to give it at a time when there were fewer monks in the monastery. Really, It's terrible. The power over this is the chabu. We got paid in grain, we didn't have to go get it from shiga. From Jiso: we get 2 khe, but these were smaller khe consisting of 13 <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. བྲེ] A unit of traditional volume measurement [a container] in Tibet, 20 of which typically equaled one khe or bo [also a container], although in some areas there were only 16 dre in one khe.">dre</span> and a handful each (instead of 20 dre). This was given at a set time in Spring and Fall. From Rigdra [Tib. རིགས་གྲྭ] : In the past they gave roasted barley. Later they started to give tsamba. There was no set amount, some years were bigger than others. In a big Rigdra, they would give 3 ladlefulls, at smaller ones only 2 ladlefulls. This was given in the 7th lunar month. Just after the Opera Festival, <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. ཞོ་སྟོན] The &quot;Yogurt&quot; Festival held in Lhasa to celebrate the end of the monks&#x27; summer retreat in the middle of the 5th lunar month (usually August). It was a time when Tibetan operas were performed.">Shotön</span> [Tib. ཞོ་སྟོན]. They also give the monks salt and soda [Tib. བུལ་ཏོག]. Somtimes, 4 dre and sometimes only 2-3 dre. It was different every year. At this time, we also get tea in the tshog. Although I don't go.   

**Q:**  Did you get any salary directly from the <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. གཞིས་ཀ] A manorial estate.">shiga</span> that was lent out as bowma?   

**A:**  No. In <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. སྒོ་མང] One of the large colleges in Drepung Monastery.">Gomang</span> we didn't.   

**Q:**  Can a monk survive on this salary alone?   

**A:**  It would be very hard. So some go to village, or hold <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. རྫོང] A district in the traditional Tibetan governmental structure. This large administrative unit was headed by one or two district heads (tib. dzongpön [རྫོང་དཔོན]) appointed by the Tibetan government. Typically there was one lay official and one monk official who were jointly sent from Lhasa for three year terms. They were responsible for collecting taxes and adjudicating disputes in their district. These dzong were equivalent to counties (ch. 县) in the current Chinese system of administration.">dzong</span> or some work on <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. གཞིས་ཀ] A manorial estate.">shiga</span>, some do business. The poorest monks carry goods on their backs and go to sell them to the villagers. Some work as coolies between the monastery and Lhasa. In general the monks income was poor. But Mönlam Prayer Festival is our best hope. It is like our Fall harvest.
