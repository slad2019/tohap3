**A:**  I was born right here in Thambag [Tib. དན་འབག]. This house in which we are talking is the same one that I grew up in.   

**Q:**  Your house is great! It might not be like this in the past, right?   

**A:**  Yes, I renovated it. I became a monk at age 5. My <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. གྲྭ་ཚང] A &quot;college&quot; within a monastery, for example, in Drepung Monastery there were four main tratsang: Gomang, Loseling, Deyang and Ngagpa. These tratsang were property owning corporate entities and included monks who were organized into residential dormitories called Khamtsen.">tratsang</a> was <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. སྡེ་ཡངས] One of the colleges in Drepung Monastery.">Deyang</a>. My <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. དགེ་རྒན] 1. Teacher in a school. 2. In monastic settings it also refers to an adult monk who acted as a guardian to a younger monk. In such cases, the younger monk typically lived in the gegen&#x27;s apartment (shag). In monasteries, however, it could also mean a real teacher, or the monk who served as the guarantor for a new monk.">gegen</a> was from a big shagtsang. He was the abbot of Deyang Tratsang and we call him Khen Rimpoche [Tib. མཁན་རིན་པོ་ཆེ]. His name was Shenyen Tsöndrü la [Tib. བཤེས་གཉེན་བརྩོན་འགྲུས]. I stayed there for awhile and then the eldest <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. དགེ་ཕྲུག] 1. Student. 2. Disciple. 3. Commonly the name for monks living with a gegen or teacher. These are more like wards than real disciples.">gidru</a> got separated. Then I became the abbot's servant, <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. གསོལ་དཔོན] A lama or abbot&#x27;s servant.">söpön</a> [Tib. གསོལ་དཔོན].   

**Q:**  How many people were there in your <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. 1. ཤག, 2. ཞག] 1. The apartment/room of a monk. 2. The butter fat that coagulates on the top of butter-tea when the tea is left to sit for some time. If the tea had been made with a lot of butter, this layer could be thick enough to scoop off and save to later sell or eat separately. The senior monks are usually served tea with a lot of shag.">shag</a> at first?   

**A:**  There were 6 people including the abbot.   

**Q:**  Was the abbot your relative.   

**A:**  Oh yes. He was from Thambag. He was from the family Sharkor [Tib. ཤར་སྐོར]. He was the abbot for about 11 and half years and he died just at the end of his 12 years term when he got a stroke. That was the year when his turn for giving the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. གཏོང་སྒོ] A monastic obligation to provide the food and other necessary items served at a monastic prayer assembly meeting or some other rite; this was often a required obligation for monastic officials at the end of their term of office.">tonggo</a> for the Lama Rigdra [Tib. བླ་མ་རིགས་གྲྭ], but he died before he did this and we weren't able to handle it. In the Rigdra, for 16 days you have to serve the assembly tea, <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. མང་ཇ] The morning tea served to monks from all the monastic colleges at the main prayer assembly hall.">mangja</a> [Tib. མང་ཇ]. This was done by collecting the things from the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. མི་སེར] A term that can mean serf/bound subject as well as citizen, depending on context. For example, the miser of a lord would connote the bound subjects of that lord, whereas the miser of Tibet would connote citizens of Tibet.">miser</a> and giving it to the commom monks. At that time, the 5 <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. དགེ་ཕྲུག] 1. Student. 2. Disciple. 3. Commonly the name for monks living with a gegen or teacher. These are more like wards than real disciples.">gidru</a> said that we are unable to give the Rigdra tonggo. So the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. གྲྭ་ཚང] A &quot;college&quot; within a monastery, for example, in Drepung Monastery there were four main tratsang: Gomang, Loseling, Deyang and Ngagpa. These tratsang were property owning corporate entities and included monks who were organized into residential dormitories called Khamtsen.">tratsang</a> took care of it and gave the tonggo for the Rigdra. Then after the Rigdra, we 5 gidru were given shares of the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཤག་ཚང] 1. The household or family of a monk that consisted of multiple monks. 2. The apartment of a monk household.">shagtsang</a>'s things and we stayed separated into our own shag.   

**Q:**  Where you a <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. དཔེ་ཆ་བ] A monk studying the monastic philosophical curriculum. A scholar monk.">pechawa</a> or <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. བླ་རྒྱུད་པ] A term for the common monks in a monastery (in contrast to the scholar monks who were actively studying the Buddhist doctrine).">lagyüba</a>?   

**A:**  I was a lagyüba. At that time, I was 16 years old. Then I did the post of chandeba [Tib. ཇ་འདེད་པ] at Mönlam for 4 years age the 16-20. [This is reserved for Deyang monks]. I had to go with and supervise the Olo who serve tea at Mönlam. I carried a stick then and had to say, "come quickly." The chandeba is the person who drives the Olo who serve the tea to the monks. I did this for 4 years.   

**Q:**  How did you get the post?   

**A:**  I had to ask for it. I had to ask the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. སྡེ་ཡངས] One of the colleges in Drepung Monastery.">Deyang</a> Nyertsang for this job Then after a few years I got the post of assistant <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. དགེ་སྐོས] The main disciplinary official in a monastic college (tratsang).">gegö</a>, <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. དགེ་གཡོག] Monk assistant to the disciplinary official (gegö) in monasteries.">geyog</a> and did it for 2 years. I was about 25-26 when I did that job.   

**Q:**  Did you have to ask for the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. དགེ་གཡོག] Monk assistant to the disciplinary official (gegö) in monasteries.">geyog</a> post also?   

**A:**  Oh. Yes, you had to ask by finding a backer [Tib. མགོ་འདྲེན].   

**Q:**  Do you still have your <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. དགེ་གཡོག] Monk assistant to the disciplinary official (gegö) in monasteries.">geyog</a> dress and ornaments?   

**A:**  No, these were all robbed [Tib. འཕྲོག]. (in 1959). They even robbed my food cleaver. While we were kept in the Drepung stone floor making us to put our hands our heads, the soldiers searched all our rooms for things. I did the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. དགེ་གཡོག] Monk assistant to the disciplinary official (gegö) in monasteries.">geyog</a> for 2 years. The first year I was the servant for the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཕྱག་དམ་པ] The powerful assistant to the Shengo during the Mönlam Chemmo Prayer Festival.">chagdamba</a> [Tib. ཕྱག་དམ་པ] and the second year I was assigned to the northern area of the middle circle, <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. བར་སྐོར] The inner circumambulation road that goes around the Tsuglagang (Jokhang) Temple in Lhasa. This circular road was a main market area.">Barkor</a> Changa [Tib. bar skopr byang ma] in the Jokhang. It was the area around the Tara Temple, Drölma Lhakhang [Tib. སྒྲོལ་མ་ལྷ་ཁང].   

**Q:**  What was your work there?   

**A:**  Geyog were posted at different places to keep order at the Mönlam. This was the year [1958?] when the Dalai Lama came to Mönlam [Tib. ཚོགས་ཕེབས] for his Geshe exam [Tib. མཚན་རྟགས]. It was a very elaborate ceremony on the Mönlam and the government gave the tönchen [Tib. སྟོན་ཆེན] where a very large pile of fried cookies was placed in the courtyard and let the people grab it. Then in betweeen the Mönlam and Tsomgö the revolt took placer.   

**Q:**  After your <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. དགེ་རྒན] 1. Teacher in a school. 2. In monastic settings it also refers to an adult monk who acted as a guardian to a younger monk. In such cases, the younger monk typically lived in the gegen&#x27;s apartment (shag). In monasteries, however, it could also mean a real teacher, or the monk who served as the guarantor for a new monk.">gegen</a> died, did you stay alone in your <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. 1. ཤག, 2. ཞག] 1. The apartment/room of a monk. 2. The butter fat that coagulates on the top of butter-tea when the tea is left to sit for some time. If the tea had been made with a lot of butter, this layer could be thick enough to scoop off and save to later sell or eat separately. The senior monks are usually served tea with a lot of shag.">shag</a>?   

**A:**  The abbot lived in the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. བླ་བྲང] 1. The property/wealth owning corporate entity of an incarnate lama. 2. The property/wealth owning corporate entity of the Panchen Lama.">labrang</a>, so we didn't have place to stay there and we had to hand over the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. 1. ཤག, 2. ཞག] 1. The apartment/room of a monk. 2. The butter fat that coagulates on the top of butter-tea when the tea is left to sit for some time. If the tea had been made with a lot of butter, this layer could be thick enough to scoop off and save to later sell or eat separately. The senior monks are usually served tea with a lot of shag.">shag</a> and move to new ones since the new abbot would use it.   

**Q:**  Did you have the other <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. དགེ་ཕྲུག] 1. Student. 2. Disciple. 3. Commonly the name for monks living with a gegen or teacher. These are more like wards than real disciples.">gidru</a> in the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. 1. ཤག, 2. ཞག] 1. The apartment/room of a monk. 2. The butter fat that coagulates on the top of butter-tea when the tea is left to sit for some time. If the tea had been made with a lot of butter, this layer could be thick enough to scoop off and save to later sell or eat separately. The senior monks are usually served tea with a lot of shag.">shag</a>?   

**A:**  Each <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. དགེ་ཕྲུག] 1. Student. 2. Disciple. 3. Commonly the name for monks living with a gegen or teacher. These are more like wards than real disciples.">gidru</a> lived in his own shag.   

**Q:**  How did you earn your livelihood at this time?   

**A:**  In the past, there was no problem because there were quite a lot of people giving gye/phog. No problem at all. In those days I was just alone so even if I only had a little <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. རྩམ་པ] The traditional Tibetan staple food that consists of grain that is roasted (popped), usually in heated sand, and then ground into a flour.">tsamba</a>, it didn't bother me because I will get <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. རྩམ་པ] The traditional Tibetan staple food that consists of grain that is roasted (popped), usually in sand, and then ground into a flour.">tsampa</a> on the next day and the day after. I didn't need to worry. Now if I have to worry of being short of tsamba, I have to worry about ones kids, wife and so forth it is much harder. I was alone, so I only had to worry about the each day as it came.   

**Q:**  What did you do when you were in the monastery in the day time?   

**A:**  I was a long-horn [Tib. དུང་ཆེན] player. Since I wasn't a <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. དཔེ་ཆ་བ] A monk studying the monastic philosophical curriculum. A scholar monk.">pechawa</a>, I had to do a horn blower. Later I became a long horn gegen. They gave me 13 young monks to train. We would go to a place just outside of Drepung under the huge boulder taking our beddings there and would study the long horn there for about 1-2 months. We had to sleep under that boulder during the several months of training. Then after teaching the horn, <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. གྲྭ་ཚང] A &quot;college&quot; within a monastery, for example, in Drepung Monastery there were four main tratsang: Gomang, Loseling, Deyang and Ngagpa. These tratsang were property owning corporate entities and included monks who were organized into residential dormitories called Khamtsen.">tratsang</a> abbot, umdze and <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཕྱག་སྦུག] A manager (of estates and endowments) of a monastic college or monastic khamtsen.">chabu</a> would be invited to test the trainees. A tent would be pitched up and they would test us. The trainees would have to take the test by blowing the horn accordance with the drum beating and the cymbal and also along with the words in the prayers.   

**Q:**  How old were you at that time?   

**A:**  I was about 15-16. It was after the abbot died, and during the time I did the chandeba.   

**Q:**  Playing the long horn must have been very hard? I also heard that your teeth would also go off.   

**A:**  Yes it was. One had to practice blowing with great force and strength in ones lips. You have to make your upper lip hard. They do this by stuffing the end of the horn with a rolled up monk's shawl and then you close your eyes and blow as hard as you can [into the closed horn]. Then at the height of blowing, someone pulls the plug out and the suction pulls off a piece of your upper lip the same size as the air-slit of the horn mouthpiece and one becomes hare lips. This is then soaked with hot, boiling thuka for some days and it hardens. That is how we do it. Once the lips become hard they never get soft again. My upper lip is hare lips still like this-it never healed and went back to normal. Learning to play the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. རྒྱ་གླིང] A clarinet type of wind instrument played by monks in religious services.">gyaling</a> [Tib. རྒྱ་གླིང] instrument was also very difficult.   

**Q:**  TT. When we <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. གར་ཕྲུག་པ] The ceremonial dance troupe of the Dalai and Panchen Lamas. Young boys were conscripted via a corvée levy from serf/miser peasant families who were compensated for the loss of their son by a reduction in their other taxes. Such boys left their families and moved either to Lhasa or Shigatse.">gadrukpa</a> play the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. རྒྱ་གླིང] A clarinet type of wind instrument played by monks in religious services.">gyaling</a>, we didn't need to blow the way called damgyag] [Tib. ?], but you had to do that, right?   

**A:**  Yes. This was the circulation of air [Tib. ཕུ་སྐོར] we practiced when blowing. The inhaling of air was done through the nose while the exhaling was done through the mouth at the same time. One has to play the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. རྒྱ་གླིང] A clarinet type of wind instrument played by monks in religious services.">gyaling</a> keeping it horizontal. They teach this by putting thorns under your armpits so that if they begin to drop their elbows, they get stuck by the thorns. A weight, usually a small bag of <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. རྩམ་པ] The traditional Tibetan staple food that consists of grain that is roasted (popped), usually in heated sand, and then ground into a flour.">tsamba</a> which we usually take to the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཚོགས] 1. A prayer assembly meeting in monasteries when all the monks come to an assembly hall and chant prayers together. 2. An offering made of tsamba, butter and dry cheese in the shape of a cone.">tsog</a> [Tib. ཚོགས་ཁུག], was placed at the other end of the gyaling to strengthen you to be able to keep the gyaling horizontaly. Thus, the trainee was told to practice walking around from the place called Jirisur [Tib. spyi ri zur ?] for a long distances like that with the thorn under their arms blowing until they reached the place where the cow dung seller called Ochorama [Tib. ཨོ་ཇོ་ར་མ] comes driving yaks with cow dung loads and sell the cow dung in small bags and this cow dung was known to be very blessed and sacred [Tib. བྱིན་རླབས་ཆེན་པོ] because it was said that at the time of Tsongkhapa [Tib. ཙོང་ཁ་པ], a piece of cow <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. གུང] A high title in the Tibetan government.">gung</a> could boil a kettle of tea. Now this place is where they park vehicles. Since I didn't know <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. དཔེ་ཆ] Religious books/texts, scriptures.">pecha</a>, this was the only I had to go. The long horn and the gyaling players have to learn kind of notes of the music [Tib. རོལ་ཚིག] which was written in the printing script, ujen [Tib. དབུ་ཅན]. Se we had to learn ujen well even we were lagyüba. I still have all the notes which I have handed over to the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. སྡེ་ཡངས] One of the colleges in Drepung Monastery.">Deyang</a> horn players. In Deyang, on the 5th, there were 5 <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. གྲྭ་ཇ] The prayer session sponsored by the tratsang (college) at which tea was served to its monks who attended.">traja</a> where they recite the prayers to propitiate the protectve deities, gangso [Tib. བསྐངས་གསོ]. This is a real test for the long horn and gyaling blowers, since the whole assembly was mainly blowing these instruments which had to be kept in strict time with the drums and cymbals and prayer words as they were lead by the umdze. The musicians had to be good at the prayers also to do this well, although they were poor with religious studies like debating.   

**Q:**  How long did you have to study to learn?   

**A:**  About two months. It started after <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཚོགས་མཆོད] The large religious prayer festival held in Lhasa in the 2nd Tibetan lunar month.">Tshongjö</a>, when the days are a bit longer.   

**Q:**  Did you get extra gye/phog for this?   

**A:**  No. This was a tax or obligation of the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. བླ་རྒྱུད་པ] A term for the common monks in a monastery (in contrast to the scholar monks who were actively studying the Buddhist doctrine).">lagyüba</a> which was called <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. གཞོན་ཁྲལ] The work obligations all young monks have to do for the monastery (it literally means &quot;youth tax&quot;).">shöndre</a> or shamthotre [Tib. ཤམ་ཐབས་ཁྲལ].   

**Q:**  What other kinds of <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. གཞོན་ཁྲལ] The work obligations all young monks have to do for the monastery (it literally means &quot;youth tax&quot;).">shöndre</a> were there?   

**A:**  Aside from this, there was not much shöndre. If there was construction work to do in the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. གྲྭ་ཚང] A &quot;college&quot; within a monastery, for example, in Drepung Monastery there were four main tratsang: Gomang, Loseling, Deyang and Ngagpa. These tratsang were property owning corporate entities and included monks who were organized into residential dormitories called Khamtsen.">tratsang</a>, then we young monks were sent and also when they renovate Tsuglagang.   

**Q:**  If you go to build house, would you get food?   

**A:**  We got food but not wages.   

**Q:**  What about sweeping and serving tea?   

**A:**  The sweeping was done by the sweepers [Tib. གད་པ]. The ones who served tea were <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཐབ་གཡོག] Monks or laymen who work as servants/manual laborers in kitchens (normally monastic kitchens).">thabyog</a>, not monks.   

**Q:**  If the monks went for building houses in the monastery as <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. གཞོན་ཁྲལ] The work obligations all young monks have to do for the monastery (it literally means &quot;youth tax&quot;).">shöndre</a>, was food given?   

**A:**  Yes, but no other wages.   

**Q:**  Were you a <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ལྡབ་ལྡོབ] A mildly deviant type of fighting or &quot;punk&quot; monk who engaged in fighting and other unusual behaviors for monks in traditional Tibet&#x27;s large monasteries.">dobdo</a> when you were young?   

**A:**  Yes, I was a <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ལྡབ་ལྡོབ] A mildly deviant type of fighting or &quot;punk&quot; monk who engaged in fighting and other unusual behaviors for monks in traditional Tibet&#x27;s large monasteries.">dobdo</a>. When I was <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. དགེ་གཡོག] Monk assistant to the disciplinary official (gegö) in monasteries.">geyog</a>, I was nicknamed "big eyes" [Tib. མིག་ཆེན] and I was feared. [laughter] At Mönlam the monks from Sera were the worst behaved. They would spit, or jeer or fight, but I used to keep them under control. They didn't even dare to utter a word, When people said migchen was coming the Sera monks became afraid and keep quiet during Mönlam. At the Mönlam, all the places like the courtyard [Tib. འཁྱམ་ར] and Dawog [Tib. མདའ་འོག] were packed with monks. I was assigned to the worst [most unruly] place in the Mönlam known as Sera Dabla, this was the worst place of any. It was where the Sera dobdo sat and it was wild and unruly, but I didn't problem because it seems that I was destined to tame them [Tib. འདུལ་སྐལ]. For about 1 year after the revolt I stayed in the monastery, then my mother said, there is no point staying there so come back home I need help. I took all my things and returned here to Thambag. We were badly off and were short of <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. རྩམ་པ] The traditional Tibetan staple food that consists of grain that is roasted (popped), usually in heated sand, and then ground into a flour.">tsamba</a>. She had to exchange all the things at home with <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. རྩམ་པ] The traditional Tibetan staple food that consists of grain that is roasted (popped), usually in sand, and then ground into a flour.">tsampa</a> like <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཕྱུ་པ] The traditional Tibetan men and women&#x27;s dress. It is like a robe that is tied at the waist. Both men and women wear such dresses, although they differ slightly in color and in style.">chupa</a> made from woolen cloth [Tib. སྤུ་ཕྲུག] was exchanged for a <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཁལ] A traditional volume measurement used for measuring grain in traditional Tibetan society. Sizes of this unit varied somewhat, but the official government khe (called mkhar ru or bstan dzin mkha ru) weighed about 28-31 pounds for barley. It was used to convey the size of fields. For example, a field said to be 10 khe in size meant that 10 khe of seed could be sown on that field.">khe</a> of tsamba because she didn't have tsampa to eat and had nothing left.   

**Q:**  When you were the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. དགེ་གཡོག] Monk assistant to the disciplinary official (gegö) in monasteries.">geyog</a> when did the revolt take place?   

**A:**  In my second year, I wasn't able to do the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཚོགས་མཆོད] The large religious prayer festival held in Lhasa in the 2nd Tibetan lunar month.">Tshongjö</a> because of the revolt.   

**Q:**  If the revolt hadn't took place, would you have stayed as <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. དགེ་གཡོག] Monk assistant to the disciplinary official (gegö) in monasteries.">geyog</a>?   

**A:**  Sure.   

**Q:**  Is the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. དགེ་གཡོག] Monk assistant to the disciplinary official (gegö) in monasteries.">geyog</a> work only at Mönlam and <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཚོགས་མཆོད] The large religious prayer festival held in Lhasa in the 2nd Tibetan lunar month.">Tshongjö</a>?   

**A:**  Yes, only then. The rest of the time you are a regular "common" monk [Tib. གྲྭ་དམངས].   

**Q:**  And during Mönlam and <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཚོགས་མཆོད] The large religious prayer festival held in Lhasa in the 2nd Tibetan lunar month.">Tshongjö</a> time what did you do from morning until evening?   

**A:**  It was to enforce discipline to the monks in the assembly. Particularly to prevent and stop fighting and doing bad things. We each had our own spots to look after. There were 19 <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. དགེ་གཡོག] Monk assistant to the disciplinary official (gegö) in monasteries.">geyog</a> and 1 shanggo shingnyer [Tib. ཞང་གོ་ཤིང་གཉེར]. All were posted at different sites in Mönlam.   

**Q:**  At that time, there was the shanggo shingnyer nicknamed, "Crow" [Tib. ཕོ་རོག་ལགས], right?   

**Q:**  When I was the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. དགེ་གཡོག] Monk assistant to the disciplinary official (gegö) in monasteries.">geyog</a>, Crow was not there. The shanggo shingnyer at the time was the pockmarked and bearded called Dragpai Barstag [Tib. གྲགས་པའི་སྦར་ཚག]   

**Q:**  Is he still alive in Drepung?   

**A:**  No.   

**Q:**  Well, what do you do in the morning as a <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. དགེ་གཡོག] Monk assistant to the disciplinary official (gegö) in monasteries.">geyog</a>?   

**A:**  In the morning, first thing that happened was the Ragyaba [Tib. རགས་རྒྱབ་པ], the untouchable caste of people who carry the bodies of the beggars to the skyburial would give us the signal to wake us up [Tib. ལངས་བརྡ]. The Ragyabba are the ones that make the fire in the Mönlam.   

**Q:**  How do they give the signal?   

**A:**  They knock on the door of our <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. དགེ་གཡོག] Monk assistant to the disciplinary official (gegö) in monasteries.">geyog</a> office, geyog gang [Tib. སྒང]. Then the shango shingnyer checks his watch to see if it is time for the Tshogchen <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཆུ་སྐད] The stylized yelling of young monks from a monastic roof that announces to the monastic community that there will be a distribution of alms in the prayer assembly that day.">chuke</a> [Tib. ཆུ་སྐད] which is a call for <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཚོགས] 1. A prayer assembly meeting in monasteries when all the monks come to an assembly hall and chant prayers together. 2.

After this, the monks entered the assembly hall for the morning tsog [Tib. ཞོགས་ཚོགས] at the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཇོ་ཁང] A most famous temple in Lhasa that houses a holy statue of the Buddha. It is often used to mean the Tsuglagang Temple of which it is a part.">Jokhang</a> and the geyog maintained order, each of us in our spots like 2 geyog at the gate of the khyamra and 2 geyog at the north gate as the monks entered the tsog to see that the monks file in and sit down without shoving and pushing. Each monk has his own seating space and were not allowed to sit on their own wish. When all were seated, then the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཚོགས་ཆེན] The main assembly hall of a monastery. The assembly hall for the monastery as a whole.">tshogchen</a> shengo was invited to the assembly hall. We have to go to the shengo room and participate in the shengo entrance procession. The geyog do this. We go to get them [shengo] and then accompany them in. As soon as the shengo are in and seated upstairs, then the tea is served by the tea servers, Olo immediately. It was as if the shengo bring them in. The main person in charge of whether the tea and butter is okay or not is the shanggo shingnyer. He does this together with the representative, the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. རྩེ་དྲུང] A monk official in the Tibetan government.">tsidrung</a> body guard of the Dalai Lama, <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. གཟིམ་འགག] 1.

The Dalai Lama&#x27;s Simgag were called Tse Simgag (tib. རྩེ་གཟིམ་འགག) and the Regent&#x27;s Simgag were called Shöl Simgag (tib. ཞོལ་གཟིམ་འགག). They were not real bodyguards, but functioned more as disciplinarians at meetings and ceremonies. They carried only leather whips. The Silön and Kashag&#x27;s Simgag were all lower-level lay officials. They were called either Simgag or Gagpa (tib. འགག་པ).">simgag</a> [Tib. གཟིམ་འགག] and the representative of Tashi Khangsar [Tib. བཀྲ་ཤིས་ཁང་གསར] who were responsible for how much ingredients to put into the tea. There are also 2 ja ma.   

**Q:**  Who was Tashi Khangsar?   

**A:**  He was the government's representative.   

**Q:**  Do you know who was the Tashi Khangsar then?   

**A:**  His house was in Thambag which is toppled.   

**Q:**  Tashi Khangsar was not belonged to Drepung, right?   

**A:**  Yes, it was set up by the government and he was a <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. རྩེ་དྲུང] A monk official in the Tibetan government.">tsidrung</a> [wrong, he comes from Namgyal [Tib. རྣམ་རྒྱལ] Tratsang and there was one called Drönyerla [Tib. མགྲོན་གཉེར་ལགས] who died. His family is called Shagshö [Tib. ཤག་ཤོད] in Thambag [Tib. དན་འབག] and the children are still there. After the entrance of the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཚོགས་ཆེན] The main assembly hall of a monastery. The assembly hall for the monastery as a whole.">tshogchen</a> shengo, then the first, the second and third stages of tea were served in order and we <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. དགེ་གཡོག] Monk assistant to the disciplinary official (gegö) in monasteries.">geyog</a> stayed at our own posts. Sometimes, when we have some lama sponsors, we go to accompany them also clearing the way for them and leading them to their seats. The lamas would give us a present/tip for this.   

**Q:**  Does the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. དགེ་གཡོག] Monk assistant to the disciplinary official (gegö) in monasteries.">geyog</a> have the power to decide legal cases [pass sentences] [Tib. ཁྲིམས་ཐག་གཅོད]?   

**A:**  No he does not. That is the authority of the shengo. But if there is a fight where we are, then we have the power to beat them. We have the right to beat people. If we kill someone through beating we pay only 1 chegye [Tib. ཕྱེད་བརྒྱད] which is 7 and the half <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. སྐར་མ] 1. The smallest currency unit (a copper coin) in the traditional Tibetan currency system. Ten karma equaled 1 sho. 2. A work point in post-1959 Tibet. 3. A person&#x27;s name.">karma</a> or three khagang.   

**Q:**  Has this ever happened?   

**A:**  Such a thing never happened. No. We each carry a big stick/pole that we use to hit the monks, the end of which is white [peeled off]. If you hit a monk with the white part, that is nothing [since that is thinner in diameter]. But if you turn it around and hit them with the other [thick] side, this is considered illegal and we have to pay 1 <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. སྐར་མ] 1. The smallest currency unit (a copper coin) in the traditional Tibetan currency system. Ten karma equaled 1 sho. 2. A work point in post-1959 Tibet. 3. A person&#x27;s name.">karma</a> as the fine for hitting with the wrong side. The reason for this is that the pealed off part was the top of the pole hence lighter and thinner and the unpealed part was the bottom of the pole and was thicker and heavier and the beating would cause deadly consequences.   

**Q:**  Who makes the stick?   

**A:**  We have to make it by ourselves.   

**Q:**  It comes from the Mönlam firewood?   

**A:**  No, we were not allowd to do that. We have to go and steal it from someone's tree orchard or cut it off from nearby orchard and we peel them ourselves. Sometimes, we ask the owners to give us poles free.   

**Q:**  There is a difference in the diameter of the poles the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. དགེ་གཡོག] Monk assistant to the disciplinary official (gegö) in monasteries.">geyog</a> carry, right?   

**A:**  Yes. The new ones carry the thickest poles, maybe 1.5-2 inches in diameter, while the elder <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. དགེ་གཡོག] Monk assistant to the disciplinary official (gegö) in monasteries.">geyog</a> carry thinner ones. But both were thick enough. If the Mönlam starts on the 3rd, then we have to depart on the 2nd since we first have to go to the Potala for an audience with the Dalai Lama. We have to hand over our vows to the Dalai Lama. During the Mönlam, we geyog have no vows during Mönlam. What we dressed during the Mönlam, was the dress of a monk who lost is celibacy [Tib. སྦར་གོག་གི་ཆས]: 1. The edge of the lower garment [Tib. ཤམ་ཐབས] was sewn differently from normal monks 2. The water container, chablu [Tib. ཆབ་བླུག] had a dog nose design [Tib. ཁྱི་སྣ] made of leather and it was not worn in the front as normal but at the side. 3. The shawals didn't have a usual red patch at the end, but instead had a black patch. 4. We wore swords, which was forbidden for normal monks. We usually wore huge swords. These swords we borrowed from big <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. བླ་བྲང] 1. The property/wealth owning corporate entity of an incarnate lama. 2. The property/wealth owning corporate entity of the Panchen Lama.">labrang</a> and khamba traders. The lamas who lent you swords you would clear the way for them in Mönlam. These borrowed swords were studded with huge corals and turquoise. The handles were carved with gold and silver.   

**Q:**  If something comes up during Mönlam and <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཚོགས་མཆོད] The large religious prayer festival held in Lhasa in the 2nd Tibetan lunar month.">Tshongjö</a> like a fight, e.g., can you settle it right there or do you have to discuss it with the shanggo shingnyer in the evening?   

**A:**  We settle it right there, in cases where someone was doing something wrong in front of us.   

**Q:**  During your 2 years as <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. དགེ་གཡོག] Monk assistant to the disciplinary official (gegö) in monasteries.">geyog</a>, did you experience personally a case of monks misbehaving leading to a beating?   

**A:**  Yes.   

**Q:**  Please tell us.   

**A:**  I was in Dayabwok [Tib. མདའ་གཡབ་འོག] [the wild and raucus place]. This place was usually where the monks who refused to obey laws sat. I was seated in the stage with my pole while they were serving <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཐུག་པ] 1. A porridge or gruel-like soup typically made with tsamba, and if available, meat and cheese. 2. Noodle dishes in broth.">thukpa</a>. The Olo were serving thukpa at the upper part and the lower past was yet to be served. The monks were supposed to be seated. Then 2 Sera <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ལྡབ་ལྡོབ] A mildly deviant type of fighting or &quot;punk&quot; monk who engaged in fighting and other unusual behaviors for monks in traditional Tibet&#x27;s large monasteries.">dobdo</a> got up and came walking towards me. They looked fierce and carried faulse keys hanging from their waist. They came straight toward me. I was afraid, but it would not be okay if I didn't beat them and if I beat them and they attacked me I would lose my face among the monks. This would have been disgraceful.   

**Q:**  Which <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. གྲྭ་ཚང] A &quot;college&quot; within a monastery, for example, in Drepung Monastery there were four main tratsang: Gomang, Loseling, Deyang and Ngagpa. These tratsang were property owning corporate entities and included monks who were organized into residential dormitories called Khamtsen.">tratsang</a> do the two <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ལྡབ་ལྡོབ] A mildly deviant type of fighting or &quot;punk&quot; monk who engaged in fighting and other unusual behaviors for monks in traditional Tibet&#x27;s large monasteries.">dobdo</a> belonged to?   

**A:**  They were from Sera. I thought that something wrong is going to happened and I stood there by erecting my stick on the floor. Then they came near by me. So I got up and hit the first one on the back side of his neck with my stick and knocked him right off his feet. Then I hit the second one on the back side of his neck and knocked him over too. Both fell to the ground. Then I took off my shawal and left it with a monk and I hit and poked with the stick on all their joints with the stick until they weren't moving around. If they moved, I was ready to use my sword. But they were not moving and they had to be carried out on a kind of stretcher made from monks shawl.   

**Q:**  They couldn't stand up, right?   

**A:**  Yes.   

**Q:**  There was no risk since at most for killing it was only 1 chegye.   

**A:**  Right. And then at the time when all got up in line to get the alms then someone came to get their alms share.   

**Q:**  Did you know them?   

**A:**  I didn't know them. But they were from Sera.   

**Q:**  Was this in the first or second year?   

**A:**  This was in my first year. I didn't have to pay any fine for beating them. When the Mönlam and <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཚོགས་མཆོད] The large religious prayer festival held in Lhasa in the 2nd Tibetan lunar month.">Tsongjö</a> were over, one day I went to Sera for the pilgrimage putting my regular sword into the back side of my vest and I met the two of them there. This time, they shook my hands and invited me to their <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. 1. ཤག, 2. ཞག] 1. The apartment/room of a monk. 2. The butter fat that coagulates on the top of butter-tea when the tea is left to sit for some time. If the tea had been made with a lot of butter, this layer could be thick enough to scoop off and save to later sell or eat separately. The senior monks are usually served tea with a lot of shag.">shag</a> and they served me tea and the rice gruel and we enjoyed eating together and became good friends. [laughter]   

**Q:**  Since then you might have become pretty famous, right?   

**Q:**  Since then nobody provoked me.   

**Q:**  What did you have to do to when you first join the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ལྡབ་ལྡོབ] A mildly deviant type of fighting or &quot;punk&quot; monk who engaged in fighting and other unusual behaviors for monks in traditional Tibet&#x27;s large monasteries.">dobdo</a> tobtsang?   

**A:**  When I became a member of <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ལྡབ་ལྡོབ] A mildly deviant type of fighting or &quot;punk&quot; monk who engaged in fighting and other unusual behaviors for monks in traditional Tibet&#x27;s large monasteries.">dobdo</a> <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ལྟོ་ཚང] 1. The club of the Dobdos. 2. A group of people eating together.">tobtsang</a>, there was no competition where the main game is jump, <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཕྱོགས་རྒྱག] A kind of monks&#x27; competitive &quot;sports&quot; event (mostly jumping and throwing) done by dobdo monks.">chogyag</a> [Tib. ཕྱོགས་རྒྱག]. Dobdo tobtsang were primarily formed to have the chogyag where Drepung and Sera would compete. In the former tobtsang, there were the dobdo like Tengye [Tib. བསྟན་རྒྱས] and Rinchen Könjog [Tib. རིན་ཆེན་དཀོན་ཅོག] and <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. སྡེ་ཡངས] One of the colleges in Drepung Monastery.">Deyang</a> and Sera Ngagpa [Tib. སྔགས་པ] did the chogyag in the place called Digthang [Tib. སྡིག་ཐང]. And they beat Sera Ngagba badly where the Deyang won 11 events out of 12 and the Ngagpa won 1 event out of 12 events. This was called Kethagyag [Tib. སྐེ་ཐག་རྒྱག] which means putting rope on the neck. If one party won all the events, then it is called Shapayog [Tib. ཤྭ་ལྤགས་གཡོགས] which means put on deer skin and it is also regarded as a bad omen. Therefore, both those tobtsang were disbanded. We set up the new tobtsang and I joined the new tobtsang and Sera also set up a new tobtsang and then we would have to challenge each other. The Sera Ngagba's <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. རྒན་འགོ] The head of the dobdo&#x27;s organization when they did &quot;sports&quot; competitions.">gengo</a> was the nicknamed "assembly bowl" Tshophor [Tib. ཚོགས་ཕོར]. Our previous tobtsang gengo was Richen Könchog [Tib. རིན་ཆེན་དཀོན་ཅོག] He is still alive.   

**Q:**  Trindor: I heard that he got attacked because he had been the shidü.   

**A:**  He got attacked because he didn't behave well. He was lucky because except for the revolution, he would have been whipped and expelled from <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. སྐྱིད་སྡུག] An association, club.">kyidu</a> for doing a terrible job as shidü of Sangphu [Tib. གསང་ཕུ] <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. སྡེ་ཡངས] One of the colleges in Drepung Monastery.">Deyang</a> Shiga. This was one of our best <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. གཞིས་ཀ] A manorial estate.">shiga</a> and he managed things so badly that when the planting season came, there was no seed there to plant and he was also carrying a gun unnecessarily though he was supposed to be a monk. He exhausted all the wealth of the shiga by gambling called <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. སྦག་ཆེན] A form of mahjong in which the tiles have circles (like a domino tile) and each of 4 persons are dealt a fixed hand and play it out until the end.">bagchen</a> [Tib. སྦག་ཆེན] and playing the game called thubeju and the game where three dices were played in the porcelain cups.   

**Q:**  When you joined the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ལྟོ་ཚང] 1. The club of the Dobdos. 2. A group of people eating together.">tobtsang</a>, was a recommendation needed?   

**A:**  No. We consulted one another to form the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ལྟོ་ཚང] 1. The club of the Dobdos. 2. A group of people eating together.">tobtsang</a>. If anybody refused to join, we used to force them. Sometimes we would provoke them by giving them a thrashing to make them join voluntarily. We needed a lot of <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ལྡབ་ལྡོབ] A mildly deviant type of fighting or &quot;punk&quot; monk who engaged in fighting and other unusual behaviors for monks in traditional Tibet&#x27;s large monasteries.">dobdo</a>. A tobtsang usually consisted of 20-30 members. Some of them would dress like dobdo, but do not dare to join the tobtsang.   

**Q:**  Was there any head?   

**A:**  Yes. There was a <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. རྒན་འགོ] The head of the dobdo&#x27;s organization when they did &quot;sports&quot; competitions.">gengo</a>. Once the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ལྟོ་ཚང] 1. The club of the Dobdos. 2. A group of people eating together.">tobtsang</a> was formed, the members began training where the gengo would come together. Early in the morning during the three coldest period each of nine days [Tib. དགུ་འགྲིམ], the jumpers had to go to the big gorge called Tagtsang [Tib. སྟག་ཚང] where a stream of water flow down from a horn drain. The jumpers stood naked under the cold water and let it run on their chest from this horn drain. The two temples were also placed under the stream of water and the joints behind the knee and arms also. When all this was finished, we started throwing stones from the boulder. This treatment was to break ones nerves on the surface of skin.   

**Q:**  Did you hold the stones in your hands or just in your fingers?   

**A:**  We hold it this way, the double stones, <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. མས་རྡོ] A stone throwing distance competition that was one of the events in the dobdo monk&#x27;s chogyag sports competition. The stone weighed a little less than a pound and was held behind one&#x27;s back with two fingers and the thumb before throwing.

The single stone, <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. རྐྱངས་རྡོ] A stone throwing distance competition that was one of the events in the dobdo monk&#x27;s chogyag sports competition. The stone weighed a little less than a pound and was held with 2 fingers and the thumb in front. The dobdo ran from half way up the ramp and then threw it at the end of the platform.">kyangdo</a> [Tib. རྐྱང་རྡོ] and double stone, mendo were thrown with three fingers also.   

**Q:**  Was the stone so big?   

**A:**  Yes, but thicker and square in shape. The <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. རྐྱངས་རྡོ] A stone throwing distance competition that was one of the events in the dobdo monk&#x27;s chogyag sports competition. The stone weighed a little less than a pound and was held with 2 fingers and the thumb in front. The dobdo ran from half way up the ramp and then threw it at the end of the platform.">kyangdo</a> stones were thrown with the body bent down.   

**Q:**  How much does the stone weigh?   

**A:**  It weighed about 2 gyama. And there were also different sizes.   

**Q:**  How many events were there for throwing stones?   

**A:**  There was a pair of single stones, <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. རྐྱངས་རྡོ] A stone throwing distance competition that was one of the events in the dobdo monk&#x27;s chogyag sports competition. The stone weighed a little less than a pound and was held with 2 fingers and the thumb in front.

The stone weighed a little less than a pound and was held behind one&#x27;s back with two fingers and the thumb before throwing. The dobdo ran from half way up the ramp and then threw it at the end of the platform.">mendo</a>, a pair of bottom stones, kubdo [Tib. རྐུབ་རྡོ] which is thrown from under the bottom. A pair of back stones, <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. རྒྱབ་རྡོ] A sports competition of dobdo monks that involved throwing a large stone backwards over their heads to see who threw it the furthest.">gyabdo</a> [Tib. རྒྱབ་རྡོ] which is a back throw done with your back facing the jumping pit. Your body made a sommersault as you throw the stone. When the sommersault was completed, you have to end up standing erect in the jump pit. The training included 12 male sport events [Tib. ཕོ་རྩལ་སྣེ་ཁ་བཅུ་གཉིས] including both the jump and throwing. There were 4 throwing stones, a pair of single stones, kyangdo, a pair of double stones, mendo, a pair of bottom stones, kubdo and a pair of back stones, gyabdo. There were also 4 jumping events, but these were all the same style. The pit was as high as a single story house.   

**Q:**  Trindor: I heard that the pit at Sera is still in existence.   

**A:**  This is higher than the one at Sera. The pit in Drepung was located at a gorge called "Namthang kug [Tib. གནམ་ཐང་ཁུག྄] where there is a white stupa. This is the same place where the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཚོགས་ཆེན] The main assembly hall of a monastery. The assembly hall for the monastery as a whole.">tsogchen</a> umdze and tsogchen shengo trained their voices and there is a water spring called Chumigbug [Tib. ཆུ་མིག་སྦུག]. The umdze would drink water to be full from this spring and lay down on the boulder face down and then he would vomit out the water and then pratcice the umdze voice.   

**Q:**  Was there a good sunshine there?   

**A:**  Yes. The shengo would also practice his voice because he had to give the assembly speech [Tib. ཚོགས་གཏམ].   

**Q:**  Was the abbot alive when you joined the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ལྟོ་ཚང] 1. The club of the Dobdos. 2. A group of people eating together.">tobtsang</a>?   

**A:**  No, he was dead earlier, otherwise he wouldn't have allowed me to do this and even if I didn't learn <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. དཔེ་ཆ] Religious books/texts, scriptures.">pecha</a>, I would have to wear the lower garment longer [like the pechawa].   

**Q:**  Just before the revolt, the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ལྡབ་ལྡོབ] A mildly deviant type of fighting or &quot;punk&quot; monk who engaged in fighting and other unusual behaviors for monks in traditional Tibet&#x27;s large monasteries.">dobdo</a> tobtsang was eliminated, right?   

**A:**  Yes.   

**Q:**  How did they eliminate it? I heard that it was done by the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. རྒྱལ་རོང] A Khamtsen in Drepung Monastery.">Gyerong</a> [Tib. རྒྱལ་རོང] abbot. Was it true? Did the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. གྲྭ་ཚང] A &quot;college&quot; within a monastery, for example, in Drepung Monastery there were four main tratsang: Gomang, Loseling, Deyang and Ngagpa. These tratsang were property owning corporate entities and included monks who were organized into residential dormitories called Khamtsen.">tratsang</a> eliminate it or the laji?   

**A:**  The laji eliminated it.   

**Q:**  Was there important cause like fighting etc?   

**A:**  There wasn't any big trouble, but it was about to have a fight. So it was eliminated to prevent the fight.   

**Q:**  I heard that <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. སྡེ་ཡངས] One of the colleges in Drepung Monastery.">Deyang</a> and Ngagpa did the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཕྱོགས་རྒྱག] A kind of monks&#x27; competitive &quot;sports&quot; event (mostly jumping and throwing) done by dobdo monks.">chogyag</a> and then they fought, wasn't it?   

**A:**  No, it wasn't. When we lost contest against Sera Ngagba, we challenged for another <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཕྱོགས་རྒྱག] A kind of monks&#x27; competitive &quot;sports&quot; event (mostly jumping and throwing) done by dobdo monks.">chogyag</a>, but they told us the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ལྟོ་ཚང] 1. The club of the Dobdos. 2. A group of people eating together.">tobtsang</a> is getting disbanded, so they will not do the chogyag. We also disbanded the tobtsang and gave our things to the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. གྲྭ་ཚང] A &quot;college&quot; within a monastery, for example, in Drepung Monastery there were four main tratsang: Gomang, Loseling, Deyang and Ngagpa. These tratsang were property owning corporate entities and included monks who were organized into residential dormitories called Khamtsen.">tratsang</a>, sold some and offered the money as alms to the monks and we also offered a copper water container on which the names of the donators were engraved.   

**Q:**  When was this, one-year or half a year before the revolt?   

**A:**  About a year, then the revolt started.   

**Q:**  Did the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཡིག་ཚང] The highest office dealing with monastic and religious affairs in the traditional Tibetan government. It is often called the Ecclesiastic Office. It was headed by 4 fourth rank monk officials called Trunyichemmo. The senior Trunyichemmo was called Ta Lama.">Yigtsang</a> meddle into this matter?   

**A:**  No it was done by the Drepung <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. བླ་སྤྱི] The highest administrative council in large monasteries, like Drepung. It consisted of the Abbots, the Tshogchen Umdze, the Shengo and the Jiso. In Drepung it also included ex-abbots.">Laji</a> alone.   

**Q:**  During the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. བཀྲ་ཤིས་ཕྱོགས་རྒྱག] A sports competition (Chogyag) involving running and throwing events between dobdos from one dobdo organization in a monastery.">Tashi Chogyag</a>, [Tib. བཀྲ་ཤིས་ཕྱོགས་རྒྱག] did fighting take place?   

**A:**  No this was a friendly contest-no winners or losers.   

**Q:**  There was no fight in this, right?   

**A:**  Yes.   

**Q:**  There would be fighting when they challenge and compete, right?   

**A:**  Yes.   

**Q:**  Have you ever taken part in any of these competitions?   

**A:**  We challenged Sera Ngagba for another match but they refused.   

**Q:**  Where did the money to buy <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ལྟོ་ཚང] 1. The club of the Dobdos. 2. A group of people eating together.">tobtsang</a> possessions come from?   

**A:**  Partly it was collected from the members and partly from the sponsors. Our sponsor was the gambler nicknamed "ghoast khushu" Drekhushu [Tib. འདྲེ་ཁུ་ཤུག [laughter].   

**A:**  TT. He was the famouse one wearing a golden ear ring, living in the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. བར་སྐོར] The inner circumambulation road that goes around the Tsuglagang (Jokhang) Temple in Lhasa. This circular road was a main market area.">Barkor</a> Street.   

**A:**  We would invite him when there were important events going on. He would come riding a red horse with silver rein and the straps going under the tail. And the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ལྡབ་ལྡོབ] A mildly deviant type of fighting or &quot;punk&quot; monk who engaged in fighting and other unusual behaviors for monks in traditional Tibet&#x27;s large monasteries.">dobdo</a> would go to the recieve him in the stone floor. He would smoke and wear a pair of spectacles. He was a great person and used to be a <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. སྡེ་ཡངས] One of the colleges in Drepung Monastery.">Deyang</a> monk and he likes the dobdo. There were other sponsors too such as <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. སྐུ་དྲག] 1. A member of the lay aristocracy. 2. Title for government lay and monk officials. 3. A name occasionally used for the top leaders/officials in a monastery.">kudrak</a> of the dewashung. They gave everything the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ལྟོ་ཚང] 1. The club of the Dobdos. 2.

Originally, when the Deyang did the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཕྱོགས་རྒྱག] A kind of monks&#x27; competitive &quot;sports&quot; event (mostly jumping and throwing) done by dobdo monks.">chogyag</a>, Chöndzin la [Tib. ཆོས་འཛིན་ལགས] from Thamba Simkhang [Tib. དན་འབག་གཟིམ་ཁང] was a key sponsor for our tobtsang. He was the chief, margenba [Tib. མ་རྒན་པ] when they won and put the neck rope on Sera Ngagba in the chogyag.   

**Q:**  TT. Chöndzin la is now with the Dalai Lama. When the gambler Drekhushu was your sponsor would he give you everything you need?   

**A:**  Yes, he would and he would ask us what difficulties we have. If we tell them that we didn't have enough to spend he would help.   

**Q:**  Was he rich then?   

**A:**  Yes. At that time, we also had sponsors in Lhasa like <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. སྐུ་དྲག] 1. A member of the lay aristocracy. 2. Title for government lay and monk officials. 3. A name occasionally used for the top leaders/officials in a monastery.">kudrak</a> and Thambag Simkhang was also our sponsor.   

**Q:**  Are there still some family members of Drekhushu?   

**A:**  Probably not.   

**A:**  He lived in the three storied building near the long prayer pole Ganden Thangnyöl [Tib. དགའ་ལྡན་ཐང་སྙོལ], [in the Barkor] right?   

**A:**  Yes.   

**Q:**  What about the fighting and contest when serving rice gruel <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཐུག་པ] 1. A porridge or gruel-like soup typically made with tsamba, and if available, meat and cheese. 2. Noodle dishes in broth.">thukpa</a>?   

**A:**  This was a terrible contest to get the first place among the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཐུག་པ] 1. A porridge or gruel-like soup typically made with tsamba, and if available, meat and cheese. 2. Noodle dishes in broth.">thukpa</a> servers. To get hit on the head with a ladle and bleeding was a common occurrence.   

**Q:**  The fight was between the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཨ་མདོ] One of the three main Tibetan sub-ethnic areas. It is located in the northeast of the Tibetan Plateau mostly in today&#x27;s Qinghai Province. A person from Amdo is called an Amdowa.">Amdo</a> and the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. བོད་པ] 1. A person from Central Tibet (tib. དབུས) or sometimes someone from political Tibet in contrast to persons from Kham and Amdo. 2. Böpa is also used nowadays as a general name for all ethnic Tibetans.">böba</a>, right?   

**A:**  The fight was worse in <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. སྒོ་མང] One of the large colleges in Drepung Monastery.">Gomang</a> though there were fightings in <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. བློ་གསལ་གླིང] One of the main colleges in Drepung Monastery.">Loseling</a> and the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. སྡེ་ཡངས] One of the colleges in Drepung Monastery.">Deyang</a> also. In Gomang, there were <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཨ་མདོ] One of the three main Tibetan sub-ethnic areas. It is located in the northeast of the Tibetan Plateau mostly in today&#x27;s Qinghai Province. A person from Amdo is called an Amdowa.">Amdo</a>, Mongolians and <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. བོད་པ] 1. A person from Central Tibet (tib. དབུས) or sometimes someone from political Tibet in contrast to persons from Kham and Amdo. 2. Böpa is also used nowadays as a general name for all ethnic Tibetans.">böba</a>. So they had loyalty to one's ethnic group and fought when competing to get the first place and even would also kill each other. When the servers lined up one after another, usually they never slowed up from running in from the kitchen at full speed carrying their buckets of thugba in front taking a little amount of <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཐུག་པ] 1. A porridge or gruel-like soup typically made with tsamba, and if available, meat and cheese. 2. Noodle dishes in broth.">thukpa</a> in in the bucket. * At the cauldrons where the thukpa was made, <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཐབ་གཡོག] Monks or laymen who work as servants/manual laborers in kitchens (normally monastic kitchens).">thabyog</a> stood on four sides to try to control the ladeling of the thukba. But none of the runners paid attention to that and in the end the thabyog completly lost control of the process. The <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཆབ་རིལ] The Chabril&#x27;s main work was overseeing serving the traja. He was also the servant of the gegö and khempo. It had a middle status of the types of lene. The chabril was also the one responsible for beating the gong at the tsog and chöra. The chabril got an extra share of gye in the tratsang.">chabril</a> would beat the thukpa servers hard but to no avail because ethnic groups like böba, Amdo, Mongolian and the monks in the Gungru [khamtsen] would ganging up in the contest.   

**Q:**  When they were going in line to serve the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཐུག་པ] 1. A porridge or gruel-like soup typically made with tsamba, and if available, meat and cheese. 2. Noodle dishes in broth.">thukpa</a>, they would push each other with their shoulders, right?   

**A:**  Yes. Each runner banged into the one ahead of him in the queue at full speed and the thukba would splash high into the air with the sound "<a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. 1. ཤག, 2. ཞག] 1. The apartment/room of a monk. 2. The butter fat that coagulates on the top of butter-tea when the tea is left to sit for some time. If the tea had been made with a lot of butter, this layer could be thick enough to scoop off and save to later sell or eat separately. The senior monks are usually served tea with a lot of shag.">shag</a> shag" and the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཐུག་པ] 1. A porridge or gruel-like soup typically made with tsamba, and if available, meat and cheese. 2. Noodle dishes in broth.">thukpa</a> would splash on the religious decorations. The pushing and bumping among the servers became intense and more thukba was spilled and waisted than eaten when they push each othere and fall down.   

**Q:**  Is it that there were more <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ལྡབ་ལྡོབ] A mildly deviant type of fighting or &quot;punk&quot; monk who engaged in fighting and other unusual behaviors for monks in traditional Tibet&#x27;s large monasteries.">dobdo</a> in <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. སྒོ་མང] One of the large colleges in Drepung Monastery.">Gomang</a>?   

**A:**  No, its that there were monks from different region with different ethnic loyalties. In <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. སྡེ་ཡངས] One of the colleges in Drepung Monastery.">Deyang</a> there is not the fighting to be first and no fighting in the front row, but there was otherwise lot of pushing. However, the pushing and bumping was not done in front of the places where the abbot, the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. དགེ་སྐོས] The main disciplinary official in a monastic college (tratsang).">gegö</a> and the umdze were seated. They would push when they came to the east and the west sides. And they would even pour the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཐུག་པ] 1. A porridge or gruel-like soup typically made with tsamba, and if available, meat and cheese. 2. Noodle dishes in broth.">thukpa</a> from the container into their bowl which is placed on the cloak, but nobody would say anything. They are in such a hurry that they scoop out their own thukba and take just a little bit in the sola and run to get the first place.   

**Q:**  Was the post of chandeba one you had to request?   

**A:**  Yes.   

**Q:**  How did you get the idea for this and who did you ask?   

**A:**  The authority for appointing chandeba rested in the hands of the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. སྡེ་ཡངས] One of the colleges in Drepung Monastery.">Deyang</a> Nyertsang. Only Deyang can be chandeba. People liked this job because you got a double share in the Mönlam where the alms were big amount. To get the post of chandeba, you only had to give a <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཏམ་ཀ] A unit in the traditional Tibetan currency system that was equal to 4 sang. Also a silver coin.">trangga</a> garbo and a <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཁ་བཏགས] A Tibetan ceremonial scarf given to lamas, visitors, etc.">khata</a> to the Deyang Nyertsang. But to ask the shengo for the post of <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. དགེ་གཡོག] Monk assistant to the disciplinary official (gegö) in monasteries.">geyog</a> was really difficult. First when the new shengo was appointed, the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ལྡབ་ལྡོབ] A mildly deviant type of fighting or &quot;punk&quot; monk who engaged in fighting and other unusual behaviors for monks in traditional Tibet&#x27;s large monasteries.">dobdo</a> who were looking for the post would give khata as congratulations for his appointment. This was simply to get some direct contact with the shengo. When the actual asking for the post came, we had to find people to do the good office to the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཞལ་ངོ] 1. a junior officer in the traditional Tibetan Army in charge of a unit of 25 soldiers (same as dingpön). 2. the two head disciplinary officials for all of Drepung monastery and for the Mönlam Prayer Festival.">sheyngo</a> on our behalf to ask for the job.   

**Q:**  Was it hard to get this job?   

**A:**  It was very hard. There were so many <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ལྡབ་ལྡོབ] A mildly deviant type of fighting or &quot;punk&quot; monk who engaged in fighting and other unusual behaviors for monks in traditional Tibet&#x27;s large monasteries.">dobdo</a> in Drepung, but only 19 <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. དགེ་གཡོག] Monk assistant to the disciplinary official (gegö) in monasteries.">geyog</a> would be appointed.   

**Q:**  How many <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ལྡབ་ལྡོབ] A mildly deviant type of fighting or &quot;punk&quot; monk who engaged in fighting and other unusual behaviors for monks in traditional Tibet&#x27;s large monasteries.">dobdo</a> would ask for <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. དགེ་གཡོག] Monk assistant to the disciplinary official (gegö) in monasteries.">geyog</a>?   

**Q:**  There would be at least 30-40 <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ལྡབ་ལྡོབ] A mildly deviant type of fighting or &quot;punk&quot; monk who engaged in fighting and other unusual behaviors for monks in traditional Tibet&#x27;s large monasteries.">dobdo</a> who would bring their backers stronger than one another.   

**Q:**  One reason for asking for <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. དགེ་གཡོག] Monk assistant to the disciplinary official (gegö) in monasteries.">geyog</a> might be for the fame and the income was good, right??   

**A:**  Yes. Among the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ལྡབ་ལྡོབ] A mildly deviant type of fighting or &quot;punk&quot; monk who engaged in fighting and other unusual behaviors for monks in traditional Tibet&#x27;s large monasteries.">dobdo</a>, the post of <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. དགེ་གཡོག] Monk assistant to the disciplinary official (gegö) in monasteries.">geyog</a> was regarded like a model [Tib. མིག་དཔེ] among the dobdo and if a dobdo did not become a geyog, the name "geyog" would seem meaningless. Also later on, an ex-geyog was treated with respect. In mordern times, the geyog is like the Public Security [Ch. gong an] personal. [laughter]   

**Q:**  When you lived separately, did you attend the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཚོགས] 1. A prayer assembly meeting in monasteries when all the monks come to an assembly hall and chant prayers together. 2. An offering made of tsamba, butter and dry cheese in the shape of a cone.">tsog</a> where there was <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. མང་ཇ] The morning tea served to monks from all the monastic colleges at the main prayer assembly hall.">mangja</a> and tea in the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཁང་ཚན] A monastic residential unit in which monks from specific geographic areas lived. These were corporate entities with property and internal officials. Some large khamtsen had smaller subordinate units called mi tshan. Khamtsen were part of tratsang (colleges). For example, Hamdong Khamtsen was part of Gomang College in Drepung Monastery.">khamtsen</a>, <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཚོམ་ཇ] The name of the khamtsen&#x27;s prayer assembly meetings at which tea was served.">tsomja</a> [Tib. ཚོམས་ཇ] after becoming a teacher of 3 students learning the big horn [Tib. དུང་ཆེན] and living separately?   

**A:**  Only when there were alms. [laughter]   

**Q:**  What about <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. གྲྭ་ཇ] The prayer session sponsored by the tratsang (college) at which tea was served to its monks who attended.">traja</a>?   

**A:**  If there was alms I go, if not I don't.   

**Q:**  While you were a <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ལྡབ་ལྡོབ] A mildly deviant type of fighting or &quot;punk&quot; monk who engaged in fighting and other unusual behaviors for monks in traditional Tibet&#x27;s large monasteries.">dobdo</a> did you go out as a hired-servant for the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. སྐུ་དྲག] 1. A member of the lay aristocracy. 2. Title for government lay and monk officials. 3. A name occasionally used for the top leaders/officials in a monastery.">kudrak</a> or doing tailoring and harvesting etc?   

**A:**  No.   

**Q:**  Did your family have to bring you <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. རྩམ་པ] The traditional Tibetan staple food that consists of grain that is roasted (popped), usually in heated sand, and then ground into a flour.">tsamba</a>?   

**A:**  No. We received 4 <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཁལ] A traditional volume measurement used for measuring grain in traditional Tibetan society. Sizes of this unit varied somewhat, but the official government khe (called mkhar ru or bstan dzin mkha ru) weighed about 28-31 pounds for barley. It was used to convey the size of fields. For example, a field said to be 10 khe in size meant that 10 khe of seed could be sown on that field.">khe</a> of barley and 2 khe of peas of the best quality from our <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. གྲྭ་ཚང] A &quot;college&quot; within a monastery, for example, in Drepung Monastery there were four main tratsang: Gomang, Loseling, Deyang and Ngagpa. These tratsang were property owning corporate entities and included monks who were organized into residential dormitories called Khamtsen.">tratsang</a> in one year. Besides, another 3 junbo [Tib. བཅུ་འབོ] which is equal to one and half khe of grain were given to each monk by the Jiso. In addition, at <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཚོག] 1. An offering made of tsamba, butter and dry cheese in the shape of a cone. 2. A prayer assembly meeting in monasteries when all the monks come to an assembly hall and chant prayers together.">tshog</a> rice gruel <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཐུག་པ] 1. A porridge or gruel-like soup typically made with tsamba, and if available, meat and cheese. 2. Noodle dishes in broth.">thukpa</a>, rice mixed with melted butter, dresi [Tib. འབྲས་སིལ] and the sweet potatoes mixed with melted butter, droma markhu [Tib. གྲོམ་མ་མར་ཁུ] and tea were always served. So we had an abundance of food. We couldn't finish eating, in fact.   

**Q:**  When they gave these, you would go, right?   

**A:**  Yes, if not, I don't go. [laughter]   

**Q:**  If you didn't go to <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཚོག] 1. An offering made of tsamba, butter and dry cheese in the shape of a cone. 2. A prayer assembly meeting in monasteries when all the monks come to an assembly hall and chant prayers together.">tshog</a> what did you do the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. 1. ཤག, 2. ཞག] 1. The apartment/room of a monk. 2. The butter fat that coagulates on the top of butter-tea when the tea is left to sit for some time. If the tea had been made with a lot of butter, this layer could be thick enough to scoop off and save to later sell or eat separately. The senior monks are usually served tea with a lot of shag.">shag</a>?   

**A:**  I would just fool around [Tib. ཕར་ཤང་ཐབ྄] in the gorge outside the circumambulation road. If the pattrol comes, they would catch us. And we would also carry horn and <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. རྒྱ་གླིང] A clarinet type of wind instrument played by monks in religious services.">gyaling</a> and pratcice them.   

**Q:**  Would you play cards?   

**A:**  Sometimes, we would play dice and bagchen.   

**Q:**  Did you have to do any other <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. གཞོན་ཁྲལ] The work obligations all young monks have to do for the monastery (it literally means &quot;youth tax&quot;).">shöndre</a> like <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཁང་ཚན་དགེ་རྒན] The head official of a khamtsen.">khamtsen gegen</a> other than playing the big horn?   

**A:**  The turn to become the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. སྡེ་ཡངས] One of the colleges in Drepung Monastery.">Deyang</a> <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. དགེ་སྐོས] The main disciplinary official in a monastic college (tratsang).">gegö</a> would come according to the time of giving the tonggo. When the turn comes, the gegö had to give 6 traja.   

**Q:**  Did your turn come for becoming a <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. དགེ་སྐོས] The main disciplinary official in a monastic college (tratsang).">gegö</a>?   

**A:**  When my turn was about to come, the revolt took place. If the revolt hadn't come, I was in line to become <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. སྡེ་ཡངས] One of the colleges in Drepung Monastery.">Deyang</a> gegö.   

**Q:**  Did you have to be the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཁང་ཚན་དགེ་རྒན] The head official of a khamtsen.">khamtsen gegen</a>?   

**A:**  <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. སྡེ་ཡངས] One of the colleges in Drepung Monastery.">Deyang</a> had no <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཁང་ཚན] A monastic residential unit in which monks from specific geographic areas lived. These were corporate entities with property and internal officials. Some large khamtsen had smaller subordinate units called mi tshan. Khamtsen were part of tratsang (colleges). For example, Hamdong Khamtsen was part of Gomang College in Drepung Monastery.">khamtsen</a>, so no gegen. We would be attached to Hamdong and Samlo Khamtsen.   

**Q:**  Where did the money come from for serving 6 <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. གྲྭ་ཇ] The prayer session sponsored by the tratsang (college) at which tea was served to its monks who attended.">traja</a> if your turn comes?   

**A:**  We had to go look for sponsors.
