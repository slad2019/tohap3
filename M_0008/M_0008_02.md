**A:**  My parents had 8 children.   

**Q:**  Were you farmers?   

**A:**  No, my father was a kind of in charge of the Dalai Lama's stable, Chibyog Chenmo [Tib. ཆིབས་གཡོག་ཆེན་མོ]. When the main riding horses needs a change of shoes, the stable boy would come to call him and he did this, but he didn't need to shoe the other horses and he gets tips from the gag.   

**Q:**  How many people were there in your family?   

**A:**  There were ten; eight children and two parents. The eldest and youngest were girls, the six in between were boys.   

**Q:**  Where you the eldest boy?   

**A:**  The eldest died, I was the 2nd eldest.   

**A:**  A woman speaking: The eldest daughter was the lady of the household called Kokhang [Tib. ཀོ་ཁང] in Lhasa.   

**Q:**  Were you belonged to Drepung as their <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. མི་སེར] A term that can mean serf/bound subject as well as citizen, depending on context. For example, the miser of a lord would connote the bound subjects of that lord, whereas the miser of Tibet would connote citizens of Tibet.">miser</a> [Tib. མི་ཁུངས]?   

**A:**  No. Our <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. དཔོན་པོ, མངའ་བདག] 1. A manorial estate holder. 2. Chief of an area.">lord</a> [Tib. དཔོན་པོ] was Kündeling [Tib. ཀུན་བདེ་གླིང].   

**Q:**  How did your parents make you to become a monk?   

**A:**  We had to pay <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. མི་བོགས] A status wherein a peasant &quot;leased&quot; his/her &quot;freedom&quot; from his/her lord to live and work where he/she wanted. The peasants with human lease status still belonged to their lord and were required to pay an annual fee (&quot;human lease fee&quot;) to their lord. The children of human lease peasants inherited this status from parents of the same sex (i.e. sons of a male belonged to their father&#x27;s lord).">mibo</a> every year to Kündeling, so my parents asked permission from them to make me a monk and then made me a monk.   

**Q:**  What was the aim in making you a monk?   

**A:**  At that time, the parents would try their best to make sons monks. We had 6 sons, only one became a layman to look after the family. The other 5 were made monks. I became a <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. སྡེ་ཡངས] One of the colleges in Drepung Monastery.">Deyang</a> monk because traditionally Thambag [Tib. དན་འབག] village was belonged to Deyang.   

**A:**  Woman speaking: Probably, it is considered much more beneficial for the next life if you are a monk in this life.   

**Q:**  Who made your 1st monk's robes?   

**A:**  My parents. They made my complete set of monk's robe. My late mother made me a monk in the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. 1. ཤག, 2. ཞག] 1. The apartment/room of a monk. 2. The butter fat that coagulates on the top of butter-tea when the tea is left to sit for some time. If the tea had been made with a lot of butter, this layer could be thick enough to scoop off and save to later sell or eat separately. The senior monks are usually served tea with a lot of shag.">shag</a> of my maternal uncle who was her younger brother. He became my gegen.   

**Q:**  He was not the abbot, right?   

**A:**  Yes. His name is Gyentsen Künga [Tib. རྒྱལ་མཚན་ཀུན་དགའ], he is still living at Nam [Tib. གནམ] village. Now he is in his 80s.   

**Q:**  How old are you?   

**A:**  I'm 58, born [in 1933] in the Dog Year.

In monastic settings it also refers to an adult monk who acted as a guardian to a younger monk. In such cases, the younger monk typically lived in the gegen&#x27;s apartment (shag). In monasteries, however, it could also mean a real teacher, or the monk who served as the guarantor for a new monk.">gegen</a> was the food giving gegen, toter gegen [Tib. ལྟོ་སྟེར་དགེ་རྒན], right?   

**A:**  Yes, my maternal uncle was the one what you call the toter <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. དགེ་རྒན] 1. Teacher in a school. 2. In monastic settings it also refers to an adult monk who acted as a guardian to a younger monk. In such cases, the younger monk typically lived in the gegen&#x27;s apartment (shag). In monasteries, however, it could also mean a real teacher, or the monk who served as the guarantor for a new monk.">gegen</a> or the one who took me to abbot to cut the tuft of hair that is left on the shaved head for becoming a monk [Tib. སྐྲ་ཕུད་ཕུལ].   

**Q:**  How long did you live with your uncle?   

**A:**  Probably, I lived with my uncle for 7-8 years. My maternal uncle became the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཕྱག་དམ་པ] The powerful assistant to the Shengo during the Mönlam Chemmo Prayer Festival.">chagdamba</a> [Tib. ཕྱག་དམ་པ] who is the position next to the shengo. His colleague at the time was Chagdamba Ugyan la [Tib. ཨོ་རྒྱན་ལགས]. The infamous thief Kangtsug [Tib. རྐང་བཙུགས] was caught by them. Later, my uncle became some kind of in charge of the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. མི་སེར] A term that can mean serf/bound subject as well as citizen, depending on context. For example, the miser of a lord would connote the bound subjects of that lord, whereas the miser of Tibet would connote citizens of Tibet.">miser</a>, miser gopa, [Tib. མི་སེར་འགོ་པ] at Nam Village where there were many miser of the Lama Rigdra [Tib. བླ་མ་རིགས་གྲྭ] consisted of 6 abbots.   

**Q:**  At that time, did you go with him?   

**A:**  No. I stayed in the monastery. After that, my <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. དགེ་རྒན] 1. Teacher in a school. 2. In monastic settings it also refers to an adult monk who acted as a guardian to a younger monk. In such cases, the younger monk typically lived in the gegen&#x27;s apartment (shag). In monasteries, however, it could also mean a real teacher, or the monk who served as the guarantor for a new monk.">gegen</a> lost his celibacy and took a wife. Because of this, we three young <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. དགེ་ཕྲུག] 1. Student. 2. Disciple. 3. Commonly the name for monks living with a gegen or teacher. These are more like wards than real disciples.">gidru</a> were left in the monastery with no gegen. Seeing this that we had no gegen to teach us or look after our livelihood, my father came and took the three of us to the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. སྡེ་ཡངས] One of the colleges in Drepung Monastery.">Deyang</a> abbot and asked him to take us as gidru. He was related to my family and agreed to accept us. This is how we came to the labrang. The abbot was a learned geshe.   

**Q:**  Was the abbot a <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. སྤྲུལ་སྐུ] An incarnate lama.">trüku</a>?   

**A:**  No, he was a learned geshe.   

**Q:**  When your <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. དགེ་རྒན] 1. Teacher in a school. 2. In monastic settings it also refers to an adult monk who acted as a guardian to a younger monk.

The senior monks are usually served tea with a lot of shag.">shag</a> in Drepung?   

**A:**  There were three of us, the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. དགེ་ཕྲུག] 1. Student. 2. Disciple. 3. Commonly the name for monks living with a gegen or teacher. These are more like wards than real disciples.">gidru</a>. Myself and two elder brothers. Seeing there was no one taking care of us, at seeing this, my father asked the abbot to accept us three for his gidru and he agreed. When the abbot died, we gave back our other <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. 1. ཤག, 2. ཞག] 1. The apartment/room of a monk. 2. The butter fat that coagulates on the top of butter-tea when the tea is left to sit for some time.

The property/wealth owning corporate entity of an incarnate lama. 2. The property/wealth owning corporate entity of the Panchen Lama.">labrang</a> quarters in Deyang.   

**Q:**  How many years did you live with the abbot?   

**A:**  Probabaly, I lived with the abbot for about 10 years.   

**Q:**  What were your daily duties at that time?   

**A:**  I just acted as a servant for the abbot. He taught us daily 4 words from the scriptures, which we had to learn by heart or we wouldn't get the pag. [laughter] I had a hard time since I wasn't so smart. My two elder brothers did well, but I couldn't do this learning business.   

**Q:**  What did you do when your former <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. དགེ་རྒན] 1. Teacher in a school. 2. In monastic settings it also refers to an adult monk who acted as a guardian to a younger monk. In such cases, the younger monk typically lived in the gegen&#x27;s apartment (shag). In monasteries, however, it could also mean a real teacher, or the monk who served as the guarantor for a new monk.">gegen</a> was absent?   

**A:**  Nothing, When alms were distributed, we went to <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཚོག] 1. An offering made of tsamba, butter and dry cheese in the shape of a cone. 2. A prayer assembly meeting in monasteries when all the monks come to an assembly hall and chant prayers together.">tshog</a> otherwise we played and roamed around [Tib. འཁྲབ].   

**Q:**  In day time, did you have something to play in the monastery?   

**A:**  We played around like small kids.   

**Q:**  The <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. དགེ་སྐོས] The main disciplinary official in a monastic college (tratsang).">gegö</a> didn't scold you when you were playing around?   

**A:**  No. They are only interested in what you do during the tsog.   

**Q:**  After becoming a <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. དགེ་ཕྲུག] 1. Student. 2. Disciple. 3. Commonly the name for monks living with a gegen or teacher. These are more like wards than real disciples.">gidru</a> of the abbot did you start studies?   

**A:**  Yes. I started with the Tibetan alphabet. My two older brothers did well and knew more when we joined the abbot's <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. 1. ཤག, 2. ཞག] 1. The apartment/room of a monk. 2. The butter fat that coagulates on the top of butter-tea when the tea is left to sit for some time. If the tea had been made with a lot of butter, this layer could be thick enough to scoop off and save to later sell or eat separately. The senior monks are usually served tea with a lot of shag.">shag</a>, but I had to start with ka kha. But in the end I got a little command of reading but not much else.   

**Q:**  What daily work did you do for the abbot?   

**A:**  We did cleaning of rooms, making water offerings. The floor especially had to be cleaned by stepping on a piece of cloth, dogchi [Tib. རྡོག་འཕྱིད] until you could see your face in it.   

**Q:**  What your other daily duties or work?   

**A:**  When there is <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཚོགས] 1. A prayer assembly meeting in monasteries when all the monks come to an assembly hall and chant prayers together. 2. An offering made of tsamba, butter and dry cheese in the shape of a cone.">tsog</a> we go to the tsog. Then we had to make food for the abbot. Apart from these, since it was a big <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. བླ་བྲང] 1. The property/wealth owning corporate entity of an incarnate lama. 2. The property/wealth owning corporate entity of the Panchen Lama.">labrang</a>, there were many additional duties they came up, e.g. we acted as receivers when visitors came to see the abbot, serving food etc.   

**Q:**  At that time, was the abbot the incumbent?   

**A:**  Yes. His name is Shenyen Tsöndrü [Tib. བཤེས་གཉེན་བརྩོན་འགྲུས]. He was a great scholar with big eyebrows raised up like this.   

**Q:**  Did you turn over all your alms to the abbot?   

**A:**  Sure. We kept nothing for ourselves.   

**Q:**  So you were sharing the same livelihood, right?   

**A:**  Yes, the abbot took care of our living like food and clothes.   

**Q:**  Did you have to go to <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཚོགས] 1. A prayer assembly meeting in monasteries when all the monks come to an assembly hall and chant prayers together. 2. An offering made of tsamba, butter and dry cheese in the shape of a cone.">tsog</a> to get your alms, or were they brought to you at the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. བླ་བྲང] 1. The property/wealth owning corporate entity of an incarnate lama. 2. The property/wealth owning corporate entity of the Panchen Lama.">labrang</a>?   

**A:**  We had to go. We got the abbot's share and another <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. དགེ་ཕྲུག] 1. Student. 2. Disciple. 3. Commonly the name for monks living with a gegen or teacher. These are more like wards than real disciples.">gidru</a>'s share for his servant, <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. གསོལ་དཔོན] A lama or abbot&#x27;s servant.">söpön</a> [Tib. གསོལ་དཔོན] but we ourselves had to go.   

**Q:**  In <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. སྡེ་ཡངས] One of the colleges in Drepung Monastery.">Deyang</a>, did you have the custom of getting the alms shares called <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. སྐལ་ལེན] A special right allowing certain monks to take their share of alms outside of the prayer assembly hall. This privilege meant they did not have to attend the prayer session to get their alms.">kelen</a> [Tib. སྐལ་ལེན]?   

**A:**  Yes, we had that.   

**Q:**  How did you do that?   

**Q:**  Those monks who were not able to attend the assemblies yet wanted to get their share of alms, could do so. But this had to be done through the permission of the gegö. That is kelen. They waited for their alms at the place outside the main gate of the assembly hall, <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. སྒོ་མཆོར] The area outside of the monastic assembly hall that is supported by tall pillars.">gomchor</a> [Tib. སྒོ་འཕྱོར]. They didn't need to wear their cloak and after the alms were given to the common monks and the they get the shares. Once they got their share they returned home.   

**Q:**  Could you do the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. སྐལ་ལེན] A special right allowing certain monks to take their share of alms outside of the prayer assembly hall. This privilege meant they did not have to attend the prayer session to get their alms.">kelen</a>?   

**A:**  No. <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. སྐལ་ལེན] A special right allowing certain monks to take their share of alms outside of the prayer assembly hall. This privilege meant they did not have to attend the prayer session to get their alms.">kelen</a> had to inform their reasons for being absent from <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཚོགས] 1. A prayer assembly meeting in monasteries when all the monks come to an assembly hall and chant prayers together. 2. An offering made of tsamba, butter and dry cheese in the shape of a cone.">tsog</a> and after being permitted as one, they could send some one as the replacement [Tib. ཚབ] to get their shares on the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. སྒོ་མཆོར] The area outside of the monastic assembly hall that is supported by tall pillars.">gomchor</a> and the distributor would give them their alms according to his list of kelen that had been made previously.   

**Q:**  Do some monks have the special privilage to get the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. སྐལ་ལེན] A special right allowing certain monks to take their share of alms outside of the prayer assembly hall. This privilege meant they did not have to attend the prayer session to get their alms.">kelen</a> without asking for the permission?   

**A:**  No. There was no one <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. སྡེ་ཡངས] One of the colleges in Drepung Monastery.">Deyang</a> who can get the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. སྐལ་ལེན] A special right allowing certain monks to take their share of alms outside of the prayer assembly hall. This privilege meant they did not have to attend the prayer session to get their alms.">kelen</a> without asking for the permission. The ex-monastic officials who had the "thon" [Tib. ཐོན] could receive their alms shares from the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. སྒོ་མཆོར] The area outside of the monastic assembly hall that is supported by tall pillars.">gomchor</a> as the kelen. They read a list of their names.   

**Q:**  I had heard alot about the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཐོན] In monasteries, a title for monks who have finished their monastic job obligations (tib. ཐོན་ཟིན).">thön</a>, but I don't understand clearly, so how could they get the thön?   

**A:**  For example, after they finish doing the shengo they get the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཐོན] In monasteries, a title for monks who have finished their monastic job obligations (tib. ཐོན་ཟིན).">thön</a> which is also called thönsin [Tib. ཐོན་ཟིན] of the ex-shengo and there were also the similar thönsin for the ex-umdze and the ex-chatsü [Tib. བྱ་ཚུལ] and there was also thönsin for the chöndze. They could only got the alms shares, but no shares of tea and the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཐུག་པ] 1. A porridge or gruel-like soup typically made with tsamba, and if available, meat and cheese. 2. Noodle dishes in broth.">thukpa</a>. The abbot was special and got not only money and grain at <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. 1. ཤག, 2. ཞག] 1. The apartment/room of a monk. 2. The butter fat that coagulates on the top of butter-tea when the tea is left to sit for some time. If the tea had been made with a lot of butter, this layer could be thick enough to scoop off and save to later sell or eat separately. The senior monks are usually served tea with a lot of shag.">shag</a> but also they brought his tea and thukpa there which is called tsabsig [Tib. ཚྭ་གཟིགས]. The first serving goes for the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཚོགས] 1. A prayer assembly meeting in monasteries when all the monks come to an assembly hall and chant prayers together. 2. An offering made of tsamba, butter and dry cheese in the shape of a cone.">tsog</a> and the second serving was given to the abbot.   

**Q:**  After the death of the abbot, did you three <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. དགེ་ཕྲུག] 1. Student. 2. Disciple. 3. Commonly the name for monks living with a gegen or teacher. These are more like wards than real disciples.">gidru</a> live separately?   

**A:**  Yes.   

**Q:**  What share of the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. 1. ཤག, 2. ཞག] 1. The apartment/room of a monk. 2. The butter fat that coagulates on the top of butter-tea when the tea is left to sit for some time. If the tea had been made with a lot of butter, this layer could be thick enough to scoop off and save to later sell or eat separately. The senior monks are usually served tea with a lot of shag.">shag</a> were you given?   

**A:**  The abbot's possessions such as carpets, beddings, cupboards, tables etc. were divided among us three students.   

**Q:**  Did you divide the things?   

**A:**  The <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. གྲྭ་ཚང] A &quot;college&quot; within a monastery, for example, in Drepung Monastery there were four main tratsang: Gomang, Loseling, Deyang and Ngagpa. These tratsang were property owning corporate entities and included monks who were organized into residential dormitories called Khamtsen.">tratsang</a> divided for us and the tratsang also gave the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. གཏོང་སྒོ] A monastic obligation to provide the food and other necessary items served at a monastic prayer assembly meeting or some other rite; this was often a required obligation for monastic officials at the end of their term of office.">tonggo</a> for the Lama Rigdra [Tib. བླ་མ་རིགས་གྲྭ] which was obliged for the late abbot to give and then the tratsang divided the remaining things among the gidru.   

**Q:**  What share did you receive?   

**A:**  I received 1 cupboard, one table, one small statue and some foodstuffs such as <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. རྩམ་པ] The traditional Tibetan staple food that consists of grain that is roasted (popped), usually in heated sand, and then ground into a flour.">tsamba</a> and tea bricks and butter. Of course private robes, both old and new, which were made for us by the abbot, we each kept. the abbot's own clothes were offered to the new abbot.   

**Q:**  When you separated, what plans did you have for your future?   

**A:**  I was only 15-16 at that time and didn't think much about the future. For a time I lived as a <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ལྡབ་ལྡོབ] A mildly deviant type of fighting or &quot;punk&quot; monk who engaged in fighting and other unusual behaviors for monks in traditional Tibet&#x27;s large monasteries.">dobdo</a> and later became one of <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. སྡེ་ཡངས] One of the colleges in Drepung Monastery.">Deyang</a>'s 12 chandeba [Tib. ཇ་འདེད་པ].   

**Q:**  Who appointed you chandeba?   

**A:**  The Nyertsang.   

**Q:**  Was this your own idea or that of your parents?   

**A:**  My own. My parents wouldn't be bothered with such dealings. And in any case my father had already died.   

**Q:**  What interested you in becoming a <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ལྡབ་ལྡོབ] A mildly deviant type of fighting or &quot;punk&quot; monk who engaged in fighting and other unusual behaviors for monks in traditional Tibet&#x27;s large monasteries.">dobdo</a>?   

**A:**  Mainly because I hated to study <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. དཔེ་ཆ] Religious books/texts, scriptures.">pecha</a> and when I saw pecha, I see it like kind of darkness and I was happy to be a dobdo. I misbehaved badly then-I smoked and drank chang. But these were done only behind the back of the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. གྲྭ་ཚང] A &quot;college&quot; within a monastery, for example, in Drepung Monastery there were four main tratsang: Gomang, Loseling, Deyang and Ngagpa. These tratsang were property owning corporate entities and included monks who were organized into residential dormitories called Khamtsen.">tratsang</a> authorities such as the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. དགེ་སྐོས] The main disciplinary official in a monastic college (tratsang).">gegö</a>, the shengo and abbot I would burn <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. རྩམ་པ] The traditional Tibetan staple food that consists of grain that is roasted (popped), usually in sand, and then ground into a flour.">tsampa</a> in a clay pot near the window of the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. 1. ཤག, 2. ཞག] 1. The apartment/room of a monk. 2. The butter fat that coagulates on the top of butter-tea when the tea is left to sit for some time. If the tea had been made with a lot of butter, this layer could be thick enough to scoop off and save to later sell or eat separately. The senior monks are usually served tea with a lot of shag.">shag</a> when I smoke. After I came out of the monastery I didn't smoke and drink chang. Dobdo has a separate shag and courtyard and as one passed by this courtyard, you could smell the aroma of cigarettes. [laughter]   

**Q:**  Did you play dice?   

**A:**  Yes, but not in our shag. We went far away outside the circumambulation road beyond the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. སྒོ་མང] One of the large colleges in Drepung Monastery.">Gomang</a> orchard [Tib. ལྕང་གསེབ]. The big boulder on the other side was the place where we practice big horn and <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. རྒྱ་གླིང] A clarinet type of wind instrument played by monks in religious services.">gyaling</a> [Tib. དུང་པ་རྒྱ་གླིང] and there were earthern brick platforms [Tib. ས་ཁྲི] where we sit.   

**Q:**  What did you eat for your daily meals when you lived with your uncle? Mostly was it <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. རྩམ་པ] The traditional Tibetan staple food that consists of grain that is roasted (popped), usually in sand, and then ground into a flour.">tsampa</a>?   

**A:**  Our staple food was <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. རྩམ་པ] The traditional Tibetan staple food that consists of grain that is roasted (popped), usually in heated sand, and then ground into a flour.">tsamba</a>. We used to have tsamba in the morning. When there were <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཚོགས] 1. A prayer assembly meeting in monasteries when all the monks come to an assembly hall and chant prayers together. 2. An offering made of tsamba, butter and dry cheese in the shape of a cone.">tsog</a>, we used to eat the tsamba with the grease on the butter tea [Tib. ཞག་སྤགས] served there.

**Q:**  Did you have to go to the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. སྐུ་རིམ] A religious prayer service for monks.">kurim</a>?   

**A:**  Yes. I was very happy to go there because we had to chant the Drölma [Tib. སྒྲོལ་མ] prayer of the Tara. I knew how to recite the Drölma.   

**Q:**  Was anything served at <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. སྐུ་རིམ] A religious prayer service for monks.">kurim</a> like tea?

The senior monks are usually served tea with a lot of shag.">shag</a>, were your meals cooked separately or the same as his?   

**A:**  First it was cooked together but later it was separate since uncle left to be the shidü.   

**Q:**  When you lived with the abbot, were the meals the same or different?   

**A:**  For the abbot we had to make his tea and food separate and clean. But we had anything we liked, because he never interfered with our meals and the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཤག་ཚང] 1. The household or family of a monk that consisted of multiple monks. 2. The apartment of a monk household.">shagtsang</a> was rich then.   

**Q:**  After working as chandeba, did you become a long horn and <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. རྒྱ་གླིང] A clarinet type of wind instrument played by monks in religious services.">gyaling</a> blower?   

**A:**  Yes, my pratcice to be a long horn and <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. རྒྱ་གླིང] A clarinet type of wind instrument played by monks in religious services.">gyaling</a> player had already started when I was the chandeba.   

**Q:**  How many times in a month did you have to blow the horn?   

**A:**  There was no time limit. It depended on the frequency of the prayer chantings. Whenever a prayer chanting took place, the blowers would be ordered to play. This included rituals outside of the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. གྲྭ་ཚང] A &quot;college&quot; within a monastery, for example, in Drepung Monastery there were four main tratsang: Gomang, Loseling, Deyang and Ngagpa. These tratsang were property owning corporate entities and included monks who were organized into residential dormitories called Khamtsen.">tratsang</a> as well. We had to go to play the horn and the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. རྒྱ་གླིང] A clarinet type of wind instrument played by monks in religious services.">gyaling</a> when they perform rituals for the oracles; Tenmai Simkhang [Tib. བསྟན་མའི་གཟིམ་ཁང], Pushar [Tib. ཕུ་ཤར] and Pari Gonshar [Tib. བྲག་རི་དགོན་གསར ]) etc. The most important occasion was on the 10th of the 5th lunar month [Tib. ཚེས་བཅུ] which was a festival for the Samye when all the oracles go there. At occasions when the oracles are in trance, the horn and gyaling blowers were also considered important and given the blessing <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. 1. ཆང, 2. བྱང] 1. Tibetan locally brewed barley beer. 2. North; nomad areas north of Lhasa in Nagchuga Prefecture 3. ch. 厂 factory.">chang</a> from the oracle's own bowl because those oracles such as Pushar, Thambak Shanggo [Tib. dan 'bnag zhang go] Goshar Tsenkhang [Tib. སྒོ་ཤར་བཙན་ཁང] etc would not go into trance without the presence of monks from <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. སྡེ་ཡངས] One of the colleges in Drepung Monastery.">Deyang</a> Tratsang performing the rituals.   

**Q:**  Who was the head of the horn blowers? And who would order or organize you to participate in these occasions?   

**A:**  Nobody. We had 12 blowers who were divided into 6 units of two each. Their duty obligation was rotated. Which month we were on duty was listed beforehand, so we knew where to go when the time came.   

**Q:**  But who would inform you? For instance, if you had to go for a ritual the next day who would give you the message?   

**A:**  The sponsor who wants to perform the ritual would inform us. For instance, if Damba Simkhang were to perform a rituals the next day, they would inform the horn and <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. རྒྱ་གླིང] A clarinet type of wind instrument played by monks in religious services.">gyaling</a> blowers .   

**Q:**  Do the horn and <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. རྒྱ་གླིང] A clarinet type of wind instrument played by monks in religious services.">gyaling</a> blowers receive any kind of wages?   

**A:**  They receive two kinds of wages; the same wages [Tib. སྐུ་ཡོན] that the they gave the monks and the they also give is tips for buying bread [Tib. བག་ལེབ་ཉོ་ཡས]. The wages was handed over to the association of horn and <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. རྒྱ་གླིང] A clarinet type of wind instrument played by monks in religious services.">gyaling</a> blowers [Tib. དུང་པ་སྤྱི་པ] for accumulating the common fund [Tib. སྤྱི་འཇོག], but the tips were kept by the individuals.   

**Q:**  And they serve you the food, right?   

**A:**  Yes.   

**Q:**  They also get the gye/phog shares in the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. གྲྭ་ཚང] A &quot;college&quot; within a monastery, for example, in Drepung Monastery there were four main tratsang: Gomang, Loseling, Deyang and Ngagpa. These tratsang were property owning corporate entities and included monks who were organized into residential dormitories called Khamtsen.">tratsang</a>, right?   

**A:**  Yes.   

**Q:**  How long does this <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. གཞོན་ཁྲལ] The work obligations all young monks have to do for the monastery (it literally means &quot;youth tax&quot;).">shöndre</a> for blowing horn last?   

**A:**  For 12 years.   

**Q:**  After 12 years, was there any other tax?   

**A:**  No. Then we finish the shöndre.   

**Q:**  Was there any promotion of post after the 12 years?   

**A:**  No.   

**Q:**  What about the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. གཞོན་ཁྲལ] The work obligations all young monks have to do for the monastery (it literally means &quot;youth tax&quot;).">shöndre</a> for those who didn't know blowing horn and <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. རྒྱ་གླིང] A clarinet type of wind instrument played by monks in religious services.">gyaling</a>?   

**A:**  Blowing was taught early to all young monks who did badly at studies. But those who then couldn't learn blowing, had to pay a certain amount of money as "blowing fee "phula" [Tib. ཕུ་གླ] per month to the association. It was not a big amount-about equal to 6 <a href="#" data-tooltip="[ch. 元] China&#x27;s basic currency unit. A yuan is divided into 100 fen and 10 jiao. It is also known as renminbi or &quot;people&#x27;s currency.&quot;">yuan</a> a year.   

**Q:**  What made you become a <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. དགེ་གཡོག] Monk assistant to the disciplinary official (gegö) in monasteries.">geyog</a>? Did you ask for the geyog?   

**A:**  I myself didn't have the idea first. My sister who was living in Kokhang [Tib. ཀོ་ཁང] and her husband Thöndrub Norbu [Tib. དོན་གྲུབ་ནོར་བུ] who was the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. གཉེར་པ] A steward or manager. In some monasteries, the nyerpa was in charge of storerooms under the authority of a higher manager called a chandzö.">nyerpa</a> of the Dalai Lama's famliy, <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཡབ་གཞིས] 1. The title given to a family of a Dalai Lama. 2. When used by itself, e.g., Yabshi&#x27;s house, it refers to the family of the current Dalai Lama.">Yabshi</a> Tagtser [Tib. ཡབ་གཞིས་སྟག་འཚེར] got the idea first. Thöndrub Norbu was released from the jail and he is still alive. The chandeba was like an ugly work among the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ལྡབ་ལྡོབ] A mildly deviant type of fighting or &quot;punk&quot; monk who engaged in fighting and other unusual behaviors for monks in traditional Tibet&#x27;s large monasteries.">dobdo</a> dealing with the Olo, the tea and <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཐུག་པ] 1. A porridge or gruel-like soup typically made with tsamba, and if available, meat and cheese. 2. Noodle dishes in broth.">thukpa</a> server in the Mönlam who were like baggars. So Thöndrub Norbu told me not to do the chandeba which is like beggar's work and he wanted me to get a better position and he informed the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. སྤྱི་ཁྱབ་མཁན་པོ] The highest monk official in the traditional Tibetan government. He was the head of the monk official segment, the Dalai Lama&#x27;s household and the Dalai Lama&#x27;s private storeroom [tib. dzbug].">Jigyab khempo</a>, [the Dalai Lama's elder brother], to do a good office [Tib. འགོ་འདྲེན] for me to become the geyog.   

**Q:**  So you didn't have the idea, by they taught you, right?   

**A:**  Yes. I had been doing chandeba for 4 years and I was a senior one and didn't have too much work and I was happy.   

**Q:**  You have to ask the shengo for the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. དགེ་གཡོག] Monk assistant to the disciplinary official (gegö) in monasteries.">geyog</a> position, right?   

**A:**  Yes, after I got the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. དགེ་གཡོག] Monk assistant to the disciplinary official (gegö) in monasteries.">geyog</a> position, I went to shengo with a <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཁ་བཏགས] A Tibetan ceremonial scarf given to lamas, visitors, etc.">khata</a> as the ceremonial procedure [Tib. རྟེན་འབྲེལ].   

**Q:**  Did you go to the shengo's <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. 1. ཤག, 2. ཞག] 1. The apartment/room of a monk. 2. The butter fat that coagulates on the top of butter-tea when the tea is left to sit for some time. If the tea had been made with a lot of butter, this layer could be thick enough to scoop off and save to later sell or eat separately. The senior monks are usually served tea with a lot of shag.">shag</a>?   

**A:**  Yes. Before that, one day a stable boy messenger [Tib. ཆིབ་གཡོག] came to me with a letter [Tib. ཡིག་ཆུང] from the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. སྤྱི་ཁྱབ་མཁན་པོ] The highest monk official in the traditional Tibetan government. He was the head of the monk official segment, the Dalai Lama&#x27;s household and the Dalai Lama&#x27;s private storeroom [tib. dzbug].">Jigyab khempo</a> and told me to deliver it to the shengo with a scarf. I took the letter to the shengo and the shengo told me not to tell anyone about it. I got the post easily because my backer was strong. Thöndrub Norbu was in the prison in Kyangmo [Tib. རྐྱང་མོ] [a prison camp located west side of Lhasa] and was sentenced to death sentence with two-year reprieve and force labor; stay of execution [Tib. ལོ་གཉིས་སྲོག་ཐོག], but he was taken out from the prison when Lobsang Samten [Tib. བློ་བཟང་བསམ་གཏན] and Gusung Depön came to Lhasa for the visit.   

**Q:**  What special income did the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. དགེ་གཡོག] Monk assistant to the disciplinary official (gegö) in monasteries.">geyog</a> get?   

**A:**  We had good income, but first, each <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. དགེ་གཡོག] Monk assistant to the disciplinary official (gegö) in monasteries.">geyog</a> had to give the shengo 50 <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. རྡོ་ཚད] A currency unit in traditional Tibet that was equal to 50 ngüsang.">dotse</a> as the bribe for granting the post [Tib. sybabs rten].   

**Q:**  Did you have to give this?   

**A:**  Yes.   

**Q:**  Where do you get 50 <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. རྡོ་ཚད] A currency unit in traditional Tibet that was equal to 50 ngüsang.">dotse</a> from?   

**A:**  I borrowed it from <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. སྡེ་ཡངས] One of the colleges in Drepung Monastery.">Deyang</a> Tratsang,s office called Nyerdzö [Tib. གཉེར་མཛོད]. Then we had to give another 75 <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. རྡོ་ཚད] A currency unit in traditional Tibet that was equal to 50 ngüsang.">dotse</a> to the shengo as the donation for the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. བཏོང་སྒོ] An obligation to carry out a rite or prayer session in a monastery. For example, providing food and tea for all the monks in one&#x27;s monastic college at a prayer assembly. Or it could be an obligation to give all the monks a set amount of grain or the donggo obligation that many monastery office holders had to do when they left office. Generally, donggos had associated endowments that monks used by turns to fund a donggo. The monk with the donggo obligation would lend out the capital of the endowment and pay for the event from the interest he collected. This was also used for ritual obligations of government offices like the Tseja Office.">donggo</a> [like a forced donation] at the end of his term. The main income for the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. དགེ་གཡོག] Monk assistant to the disciplinary official (gegö) in monasteries.">geyog</a> was the 14 shares of alms received at Mönlam, but the income and the expenditure would not get balanced because we also had to buy the regular clothes and the clothes to dress up [Tib. གཟབ་སྤྲོས] etc for the job out of our own money.   

**Q:**  What were your other incomes out of the 14 alms shares? Didn't you have the chance to take the double shares of salary?   

**A:**  Sometimes, the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. དགེ་གཡོག] Monk assistant to the disciplinary official (gegö) in monasteries.">geyog</a> were able to hide some child monks under their shawls and take them back into the line where the alms are being given and make the child monks to get the alms and when the child monks reached the outer gate after receiving their 2nd alms, the geyog would take the money from them without being sighted by others. We would do this several rounds and the more of this you can do, the more profit you get. This way we made some extra money, but this was a bit risky since if the sponsor saw this cheating we would lose face.   

**Q:**  Did the amounts of money [50 and 75 dotse] change according to different conditions or different individuals?   

**A:**  No. The 50 <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. རྡོ་ཚད] A currency unit in traditional Tibet that was equal to 50 ngüsang.">dotse</a> was fixed for all, but the 75 dotse varied according to one location of work sites like the courtyard, [Tib. འཁྱམ་ར] and the east middle circumambulation site, <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. བར་སྐོར] The inner circumambulation road that goes around the Tsuglagang (Jokhang) Temple in Lhasa. This circular road was a main market area.">Barkor</a> Shar [Tib. བར་སྐོར་ཤར] and west middle circumambulation site, Barkor Nub [Tib. བར་སྐོར་ནུབ] etc. The price of donation depended on the site you were assigned. The best place like the one who watches the labrangtang [Tib. བླ་བྲང་སྟེང] [where the <a href "#" data-tooltip "[tib. བླ་ཕྱག] 1. The abbreviation of bla brang phyag mdzod, a major treasury/supply office that was located on the second floor of the Tsuglagang Temple and collected taxes annually from various parts of Tibet. 2. A monastic official/manager who worked for the Labrang of the abbots or incarnate lamas. For example, in Loseling College in Drepung, the Laja worked for the abbot who appointed him.">Laja</a>=office=is=liocated] paid the almost twice that of the others because a lot of income could be earned from stealing things in collaboration with the sweepers of the Laja Office. The other <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. དགེ་གཡོག] Monk assistant to the disciplinary official (gegö) in monasteries.">geyog</a> didn't have the chance to steal except they could get the double shares.   

**Q:**  How much would the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. དགེ་གཡོག] Monk assistant to the disciplinary official (gegö) in monasteries.">geyog</a> of the labrangtang pay?   

**A:**  They would pay the double amount. And they would collaborate with the sweepers and the clerks [Tib. ཇོ་ལགས] of the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. བླ་ཕྱག] 1. The abbreviation of bla brang phyag mdzod, a major treasury/supply office that was located on the second floor of the Tsuglagang Temple and collected taxes annually from various parts of Tibet. 2. A monastic official/manager who worked for the Labrang of the abbots or incarnate lamas. For example, in Loseling College in Drepung, the Laja worked for the abbot who appointed him.">Laja</a> [and steal things] and had a good income. So this site was also grabbed by finding backers. I had a strong backer, but I didn't grab for the site and I stayd in a worse place all the time.   

**Q:**  If a <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. དགེ་གཡོག] Monk assistant to the disciplinary official (gegö) in monasteries.">geyog</a> wanted to continue the next year, did he have to pay again?   

**A:**  Yes. And we had to request the shengo for the position again by finding backers.   

**Q:**  Normally, would you get the 2nd year?   

**A:**  It depended on the supporter you were relying upon. My supporter was <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཡབ་གཞིས] 1. The title given to a family of a Dalai Lama. 2. When used by itself, e.g., Yabshi&#x27;s house, it refers to the family of the current Dalai Lama.">Yabshi</a> so I was sure to get the post. Some who didn't have firm backing would often lose the post. They try again and after a 5-6 years, they would manage to get the post again and some get it after 1 year. So different <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. དགེ་གཡོག] Monk assistant to the disciplinary official (gegö) in monasteries.">geyog</a> faced different situations.   

**Q:**  If the revolt hadn't take place, what were your plans?   

**A:**  My sister and her husband were already appointed as <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. རྫོང་དཔོན] The head of a dzong in the traditional Tibetan government.">dzongpön</a> of Chayül [Tib. ཇ་ཡུལ] and I was to go with them as their servant.   

**Q:**  Where is Chayül located?   

**Q:**  Chayül is located at the southern border. The post was for 6 years. Everything was ready for departure, even layman clothes and saddle wares for the horses. When I was to come back from Chayül, <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཡབ་གཞིས] 1. The title given to a family of a Dalai Lama. 2. When used by itself, e.g., Yabshi&#x27;s house, it refers to the family of the current Dalai Lama.">Yabshi</a> was going to give me the position of shanggo shingnyer [Tib. ཞང་གོ་ཤིང་གཉེར] which is the head [Tib. དཔོན་པོ] of the 19 <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. དགེ་གཡོག] Monk assistant to the disciplinary official (gegö) in monasteries.">geyog</a>, but because of the revolt it was toppled. [laughter]   

**Q:**  What were the responsibilities of the shanggo shingnyer?   

**A:**  His job was very important. He almost took all the responsibilities of the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཚོགས] 1. A prayer assembly meeting in monasteries when all the monks come to an assembly hall and chant prayers together. 2. An offering made of tsamba, butter and dry cheese in the shape of a cone.">tsog</a> during the Mönlam. The 2 tsogchen shengo were mere figureheads compared to him where the shengo just erects his sceptre [Tib. ལྕགས་རྒྱུག] and read the prayer requesting list. They just sat on their throne and did nothing while the shanggo shingnyer controlled the order and and proceedings of all the tsog and especially controls the times of the tsog like the morning tsog, [Tib. ཞོགས་ཚོགས] the midday tsog [Tib. དགུང་ཚིགས] at the Dharma Teaching Grove, Sungchö Rawa [Tib. གསུང་ཆོས་ར་བ] and the evening tsog. If a service was delayed he would be punished. And he also would tell the Ragyapa [Tib. རགས་རྒྱབ་པ], the untouchable low cast people who carry the dead bodies of the beggars to yell the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཆུ་སྐད] The stylized yelling of young monks from a monastic roof that announces to the monastic community that there will be a distribution of alms in the prayer assembly that day.">chuke</a> to start the tsog and inspect the taste, heat and service time for tea and thukpa. He took charge over the 19 <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. དགེ་གཡོག] Monk assistant to the disciplinary official (gegö) in monasteries.">geyog</a>, though the geyog had their own places of duty he instructed them with detailed orders each morning. He had very good income from embezzling [Tib. ཟ་སྒོ]. When he came to the kitchen he would stand up on top of a huge skin bag/load of butter that weighted about 12 khe. The butter belonged to him and at the end of Mönlam he would take it home.   

**Q:**  Would he get this everyday?   

**A:**  No, he gets one skin bag/load of butter during the Mönlam and he would leave the butter load there until the Mönlam is over.   

**Q:**  There might be many other embezzlings?   

**A:**  The shanggo shingnyer has a great deal of embezzling. Whenever a thief was caught by the shengo, the possessions they seized from him would be divided into two halves, one half for shanggo shingnyer and the other for the 2 shengo. Also fines and confiscated things from other rule violators such as smoking and drinking <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. 1. ཆང, 2. བྱང] 1. Tibetan locally brewed barley beer. 2. North; nomad areas north of Lhasa in Nagchuga Prefecture 3. ch. 厂 factory.">chang</a> and singing song and opera, were also shared into two parts by shanggo shingnyer and the two shengo. shanggo shingnyer gets larger share than the sheyno since they are 2 and he is 1. The shanggo shingnyer's shares at Mönlam must have been about 30.   

**Q:**  Were the shanggo shingnyer and <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. དགེ་གཡོག] Monk assistant to the disciplinary official (gegö) in monasteries.">geyog</a> allowed to wear soots [Tib. སྲེ་ནག] on their faces?   

**A:**  Yes. Only the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. དགེ་གཡོག] Monk assistant to the disciplinary official (gegö) in monasteries.">geyog</a> did, not the shanggo shingnyer. We also wore silk red bands on the biseps of our arm, tsadam [Tib. རྩྭ་སྡེམ]. When I was the geyog, they took alot of photoes, but later there was not much left because it was burnt.   

**Q:**  How many alms shares would the shanggo shingnyer get?   

**A:**  The shanggo shingnyer probably would get around 30 shares. I am wondering how much he gets.   

**Q:**  If the shanggo shingnyer scold the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. དགེ་གཡོག] Monk assistant to the disciplinary official (gegö) in monasteries.">geyog</a>, for example, on what kind of matters would the shanggo shingnyer scold the geyog?   

**A:**  He would not scold them in the morning, in the evening after the evening tea was over, the shanggo shingnyer gave instructions to us and when the monks sit for the debate, <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. དམ་བཅའ] 1. An oath, promise. 2. A type of monastic debate where two or three monks sit while others stand and ask them questions.">thamja</a> [Tib. དམ་བཅའ] of <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. དགེ་ཤེས] An advanced degree earned by scholar monks.">geshe</a> was over, the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. དགེ་གཡོག] Monk assistant to the disciplinary official (gegö) in monasteries.">geyog</a> would gather together which was called tsenyug [Tib. ?].   

**Q:**  What do you mean by tsenyug?   

**A:**  In the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. དགེ་གཡོག] Monk assistant to the disciplinary official (gegö) in monasteries.">geyog</a> office, they had set up a high throne for the shanggo shingnyer and below him the 4 senior geyog called drepa [Tib. བགྲེས་པ] would be seated. Below that, the second four elders called kentsampa [Tib. སྐེ་མཚམས་པ] would be seated, the 4 geyog of middle positions calld batsalaga [Tib. བར་ཙ་ལ་ག] who wore dark shawls would be seated and lastly the 4 common geyog who wore red shawls would be seated according to their seniority. Then the tsenyug would start. At this meeting, each geyog would do the self confession [Tib. རང་སྐྱོན་ངོས་ལེན] of his work mistakes occured in one's sites on the first <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཚོགས] 1. A prayer assembly meeting in monasteries when all the monks come to an assembly hall and chant prayers together. 2. An offering made of tsamba, butter and dry cheese in the shape of a cone.">tsog</a>, second tsog and the third tsog and delays of duty to to the shanggo shingnyer and the 4 drepa. The 4 kentshamba acted as the representatives for the shengo by being aware of any mistake of the geyog would make and fine the geyog.   

**Q:**  What would the 4 drepa do?   

**A:**  The 4 drepa were next to the shanggo shingnyer and they would scold the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. དགེ་གཡོག] Monk assistant to the disciplinary official (gegö) in monasteries.">geyog</a> alot. They were the ones who carry thin sticks. The 4 drepa were high ranked [Tib. གོ་གནས་མཐོ་པོ] and they wouldn't get fined and they didn't have heavy duties on the sites and they would just over see us because the new geyog had to go to all the worst sites.   

**Q:**  Did the 4 elders supervise the work in the kitchen?   

**A:**  No. They were not allowed to meddle into this. The kitchen work was taken charge of by the shanggo shingnyer, the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. གཟིམ་འགག] 1. A bodyguard. 2. The guards of high officials such as the Dalai Lama, the Regent, the Silön and the Kalön. The Dalai Lama&#x27;s Simgag were called Tse Simgag (tib. རྩེ་གཟིམ་འགག) and the Regent&#x27;s Simgag were called Shöl Simgag (tib. ཞོལ་གཟིམ་འགག). They were not real bodyguards, but functioned more as disciplinarians at meetings and ceremonies. They carried only leather whips. The Silön and Kashag&#x27;s Simgag were all lower-level lay officials. They were called either Simgag or Gagpa (tib. འགག་པ).">simgag</a>, the Tashi Khangsar and the Jama.   

**Q:**  How did the tshenyug operate? Please tell us an example about that.   

**A:**  The 4 kentsamba, in the presence of the shanggo shingyer would tell the 10 common <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. དགེ་གཡོག] Monk assistant to the disciplinary official (gegö) in monasteries.">geyog</a> to stand up and we have to bend our body and they would ask us about what happened on that day and we confess about the happenings of the day.   

**Q:**  Could you give us a detailed example of such a telling of a mistake?   

**A:**  For example, the incident I told you about when I knocked out the two monks, is one such thing. I would make a full report as to how they approached me and how I smacked them with my stick (pole), and how they had to be carried off, etc. In my report I said I didn't know whether they were alive or dead.   

**Q:**  What would they say then?   

**A:**  They would say it was right for me to do that if the monks misbehaved against me. Of course, if the two had died, I would have had to pay 2 chegye as a fine.   

**Q:**  What were the some other events?   

**A:**  It was like the events where the monks shout "chu" chushargyag [Tib. ཆུ་ཤར་རྒྱག] and then whistle and fight in my site, then I report that today the monks whistled and did those things.   

**Q:**  Why would they whistle?   

**A:**  This is for causing trouble [Tib. དཀྲོག་རྐྱེན་སློང] and some also would jeer. So I would say."today some monks jeered, whistled and fought in my site, so I beat them with my stcik". I had to report in detail. If I didn't report clearly there were some other <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. དགེ་གཡོག] Monk assistant to the disciplinary official (gegö) in monasteries.">geyog</a> watching me and they would tell it. As for the fine the geyog pay, had to be chegye coins only. So we had to go to exchange chegye from the peddlers.   

**Q:**  In what instances would a <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. དགེ་གཡོག] Monk assistant to the disciplinary official (gegö) in monasteries.">geyog</a> be fined?   

**A:**  For e.g., if a <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. དགེ་གཡོག] Monk assistant to the disciplinary official (gegö) in monasteries.">geyog</a> couldn't put down a disturbance such as the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ལྡབ་ལྡོབ] A mildly deviant type of fighting or &quot;punk&quot; monk who engaged in fighting and other unusual behaviors for monks in traditional Tibet&#x27;s large monasteries.">dobdo</a> jeering or whistling, or if there are delays in his work, etc. Fines would be 5 <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཏམ་ཀ] A unit in the traditional Tibetan currency system that was equal to 4 sang.">tranka</a>, 10 chegye or 20 chegye. They also had to confess if one was late in the tsog.   

**Q:**  After the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཚོགས] 1. A prayer assembly meeting in monasteries when all the monks come to an assembly hall and chant prayers together. 2. An offering made of tsamba, butter and dry cheese in the shape of a cone.">tsog</a> were over, did you still have the authority for keeping order outside?   

**A:**  Yes, but outside people would be afraid of us and run away, so we had no trouble.   

**Q:**  Would the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. དགེ་གཡོག] Monk assistant to the disciplinary official (gegö) in monasteries.">geyog</a> make your shoulder higher by putting on something padded [Tib. ཨོ་བོག] on your shoulder?   

**A:**  Only the shengo have that and we <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. དགེ་གཡོག] Monk assistant to the disciplinary official (gegö) in monasteries.">geyog</a> don't, but the geyog would wear the satin vest [Tib. གོས་ཆེན་སྟོད་འགག]   

**Q:**  Would you mostly stay in the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཚོགས] 1. A prayer assembly meeting in monasteries when all the monks come to an assembly hall and chant prayers together. 2. An offering made of tsamba, butter and dry cheese in the shape of a cone.">tsog</a> during the Mönlam?   

**A:**  Yes. We had to stand there carrying the stick.   

**Q:**  Were the monks mischievious and cause alot of trouble?   

**A:**  The worst of all was to keep watch at the site Dayabwog [Tib. མདའ་གཡབ་འོག] as the monks there, were completely <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ལྡབ་ལྡོབ] A mildly deviant type of fighting or &quot;punk&quot; monk who engaged in fighting and other unusual behaviors for monks in traditional Tibet&#x27;s large monasteries.">dobdo</a> and this site was law less [Tib. ཁྲིམས་མེད་ལུགས་མེད]. All the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. དགེ་གཡོག] Monk assistant to the disciplinary official (gegö) in monasteries.">geyog</a> would say that they don't want this place.   

**Q:**  Trindor la: khyamra and shingra were better, but in Dayabwog where you were the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. དགེ་གཡོག] Monk assistant to the disciplinary official (gegö) in monasteries.">geyog</a>, they don't recite prayers and they were always shouting, right?   

**A:**  Yes, khyamra and those sites were quite. But in Dayabwog, there was nobdy startig the prayers and they also fight and hit each other's heads with the back side of their bowl [Tib. ཕོར་ལྟག] and they would also take out the big false key [Tib. ལྡེ་རྫུས] attached with a iron ring and hit each other with the sound "shang shang".   

**Q:**  If you sighted this, would you have to go to beat them right away?   

**A:**  Yes. [laughter]   

**Q:**  Trindor la; In the times in between the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཚོགས] 1.

This circular road was a main market area.">Barkor</a> by yelling "Wo-cho-cho" [Tib.?] which means, "make way." The people were deadly afraid when your inspection party arrived, right?   

**A:**  Yes. In the evenings, the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. དགེ་གཡོག] Monk assistant to the disciplinary official (gegö) in monasteries.">geyog</a> led by the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཕྱག་དམ་པ] The powerful assistant to the Shengo during the Mönlam Chemmo Prayer Festival.">chagdamba</a> would go for inspection of the hygiene of the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. བར་སྐོར] The inner circumambulation road that goes around the Tsuglagang (Jokhang) Temple in Lhasa.

The <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཐབ་གཡོག] Monks or laymen who work as servants/manual laborers in kitchens (normally monastic kitchens).">thabyog</a> would carry bundles of switches at this inspection under their armpit, which were to be used for beating.

**A:**  Yes.   

**Q:**  When the Mönlam was over, did the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. དགེ་གཡོག] Monk assistant to the disciplinary official (gegö) in monasteries.">geyog</a> have any other duties?   

**A:**  No. We became ordinary monks.   

**Q:**  Were the 19 <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. དགེ་གཡོག] Monk assistant to the disciplinary official (gegö) in monasteries.">geyog</a> posts allocated to the various <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. གྲྭ་ཚང] A &quot;college&quot; within a monastery, for example, in Drepung Monastery there were four main tratsang: Gomang, Loseling, Deyang and Ngagpa. These tratsang were property owning corporate entities and included monks who were organized into residential dormitories called Khamtsen.">tratsang</a> or what?   

**A:**  Two <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. དགེ་གཡོག] Monk assistant to the disciplinary official (gegö) in monasteries.">geyog</a> came from each of <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. སྡེ་ཡངས] One of the colleges in Drepung Monastery.">Deyang</a> and Ngagpa Tratsang.

**Q:**  When Mönlam was over, did the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. དགེ་གཡོག] Monk assistant to the disciplinary official (gegö) in monasteries.">geyog</a> have to give any donation to the monastery?   

**A:**  No.   

**Q:**  Did the shengo have to give the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. བཏོང་སྒོ] An obligation to carry out a rite or prayer session in a monastery. For example, providing food and tea for all the monks in one&#x27;s monastic college at a prayer assembly. Or it could be an obligation to give all the monks a set amount of grain or the donggo obligation that many monastery office holders had to do when they left office. Generally, donggos had associated endowments that monks used by turns to fund a donggo. The monk with the donggo obligation would lend out the capital of the endowment and pay for the event from the interest he collected. This was also used for ritual obligations of government offices like the Tseja Office.">donggo</a>?   

**A:**  Yes.   

**Q:**  What about the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཕྱག་དམ་པ] The powerful assistant to the Shengo during the Mönlam Chemmo Prayer Festival.">chagdamba</a> and shanggo shingnyer?

**A:**  The <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཕྱག་དམ་པ] The powerful assistant to the Shengo during the Mönlam Chemmo Prayer Festival.">chagdamba</a> would do all the harder works ffor the shengo and was like the shengo's servant. Whenever the shengo had any work to do, he would tell the chagdamba to do it. The chagdamba held a sceptre [Tib. ལྕགས་རྒྱུགས] and looked very grand. We <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. དགེ་གཡོག] Monk assistant to the disciplinary official (gegö) in monasteries.">geyog</a> only pretended to be respectful; to him outwardly, but in fact we treated him as the same as ourselves because we considered that both the geyog and chagdamba had asked for the position by giving the same <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཁ་བཏགས] A Tibetan ceremonial scarf given to lamas, visitors, etc.">khata</a> and were appointed by the shengo. But the geyog paid a lot of respect to the shanggo shingnyer because he was completely in charge of the geyog.   

**Q:**  How many different kinds of monks could one find in a monastery? Some were <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. དཔེ་ཆ་བ] A monk studying the monastic philosophical curriculum.

Traditionally there were supposed to have been 7700 monks, but in fact <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. བློ་གསལ་གླིང] One of the main colleges in Drepung Monastery.">Loseling</a> alone had that many.   

**Q:**  In the past, supposing one day I go to Drepung all of a sudden, how many monks would there be staying in the monastery?

**Q:**  When you were a monk, if you want to go to Lhasa, did you have to ask for leave?   

**A:**  No.   

**Q:**  If the monks wanted to go for a long distance journey did they ask for leave?   

**A:**  Yes, they have to because they couldn't attend the tsog.   

**Q:**  Who gave them permission?   

**A:**  The gegö.   

**Q:**  If a monk wanted to spend one night in Lhasa did he have to ask for a leave?   

**A:**  No. Nobody would know he was out, especially the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ལྡབ་ལྡོབ] A mildly deviant type of fighting or &quot;punk&quot; monk who engaged in fighting and other unusual behaviors for monks in traditional Tibet&#x27;s large monasteries.">dobdo</a> never go to the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཚོགས] 1.

For instance, you became a monk for praticing what the Buddha and Tsongkhapa [Tib. ཙོང་ཁ་པ] had said, right ?   

**A:**  We were supposed to do that.   

**Q:**  If so, who would teach you those things?   

**A:**  If every monk know <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. དཔེ་ཆ] Religious books/texts, scriptures.">pecha</a>, there would be nobody serving the monks. The ones who practice religion and the ones who work were combined together.   

**Q:**  So you people don''t know <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. དཔེ་ཆ] Religious books/texts, scriptures.">pecha</a>, right?   

**A:**  Yes, but we were serving them.

A scholar monk.">pechawa</a> just before the revolt at Gomang. Is this true, and why?   

**A:**  Yes, they did that and it was in deed a bad omen [Tib. སྡུག་རྟགས]. Even the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. སྒོ་མང] One of the large colleges in Drepung Monastery.">Gomang</a> umdze was tied to a pillar by the common monks. There were two groups and I didn't know in detail because we were in different tratsang. When we heard that they fought, we were just saying "they should fight", not knowing the reason.   

**Q:**  When the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ལྡབ་ལྡོབ] A mildly deviant type of fighting or &quot;punk&quot; monk who engaged in fighting and other unusual behaviors for monks in traditional Tibet&#x27;s large monasteries.">dobdo</a> <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ལྟོ་ཚང] 1.

Since there was no opponent, our tobtsang thought that there was no further need for our existence. So we also followed their example and we did the Lhagyel Chogyag [Tib. ལྷ་རྒྱལ་ཕྱོགས་རྒྱག] and yelled "may the god be victorious" [Tib. ལྷ་རྒྱལ་འཐེན] and dismissed our tobtsang and we gave all our belongings to the tratsang.   

**Q:**  Did only <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. སྡེ་ཡངས] One of the colleges in Drepung Monastery.">Deyang</a> and Ngagpa dismissed the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ལྟོ་ཚང] 1. The club of the Dobdos. 2. A group of people eating together.">tobtsang</a> ?   

**A:**  All of them did that except Drepung Ngagba who didn't have <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ལྟོ་ཚང] 1. The club of the Dobdos. 2. A group of people eating together.">tobtsang</a> and they didn't have many dobdo.

**A:**  For us the order was given by Drepung laji and the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཡིག་ཚང] The highest office dealing with monastic and religious affairs in the traditional Tibetan government.

**Q:**  When shengo went to Lhasa for Mönlam did he take the 5th Dalai Lama's charter, jayig [Tib. བཅའ་ཡིག] from Drepung?   

**A:**  Yes. They always kept the jayig in Drepung. The Mönlam starts on the 3rd and we go down on the 2nd where we would meet the regent on the way, we were not allowed to dismount our horse and we just go by the side. Usually, everybody have to dismount their horse when they meet the regent.   

**Q:**  Trindor la. After the shengo visit the Dalai Lama, the procession of shengo would go to Lhasa via the circumambulation road around the city Lingkor [Tib. གླིང་སྐོར] to Ramoche Temple for a pilgrimage. But they weren't allowed to go via the stupa Bhago Kaling [Tib. བྲག་སྒོ་ཀར་ནེ] [located in front of Potala.   

**A:**  Yes, we come down through the upper horse road behind the Potala [Tib. རྟ་ལམ་གོང་མ].   

**Q:**  Do all the monks go this way?   

**A:**  Only the shengo and the geyog. And then we go for the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. བར་སྐོར] The inner circumambulation road that goes around the Tsuglagang (Jokhang) Temple in Lhasa. This circular road was a main market area.">Barkor</a> and then the monk who do the prayers for propitiating the Karma<a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. 1. ཤག, 2. ཞག] 1. The apartment/room of a monk. 2.

**Q:**  When you take over the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. སྣང་རྩེ་ཤག] The main administrative office in Lhasa that was headed by the &quot;mayor&quot; or mipön.">Nangtsesha</a> would the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. མི་དཔོན] The mayor of Lhasa during the traditional era. The head of the Nangtsesha Office [tib. སྣང་རྩེ་ཤར].">mipön</a> come?   

**A:**  No. The sweepers come. We first go for the hygiene patrolling to Dinggung Chumik [Tib. ལྡིང་གུང་ཆུ་མིག] and ordered the well to be kept clean during the Mönlam. This was done because during the the Mönlam, the water for the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཇོ་ཁང] A most famous temple in Lhasa that houses a holy statue of the Buddha. It is often used to mean the Tsuglagang Temple of which it is a part.">Jokhang</a> gate Sera Tago [Tib. ལྟག་སྒོ] was taken from here. After that, we go to <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. སྣང་རྩེ་ཤག] The main administrative office in Lhasa that was headed by the &quot;mayor&quot; or mipön.">Nangtsesha</a> to take over the court [Tib. ཁྲིམས་ར].   

**Q:**  What do you take over?   

**A:**  We take over the two judicial poles hung on two sides of the door. This pole had a strapped design [Tib. ཁྲ་ཁྲ].   

**Q:**  Where would the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. དགེ་གཡོག] Monk assistant to the disciplinary official (gegö) in monasteries.">geyog</a> sleep at night?   

**A:**  All slept in the Geyog khang [office]. Not a single <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. དགེ་གཡོག] Monk assistant to the disciplinary official (gegö) in monasteries.">geyog</a> was permitted to sleep outside. The shanggo shingnyer slept in the Geyog khang also. All a geyog owned was a leather bag called khombok [Tib. ཁོམ་འབོག] in which his bedding and other belongs were kept in. All the leather bags were lined up neatly there.   

**Q:**  I heard that when a <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. དགེ་གཡོག] Monk assistant to the disciplinary official (gegö) in monasteries.">geyog</a> was expelled his leather bag was thrown out. Is this true?   

**A:**  Yes. If a <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. དགེ་གཡོག] Monk assistant to the disciplinary official (gegö) in monasteries.">geyog</a> made a serious mistake, the leather bag would be thrown out and then it is finished. Because all he owned was a leather bag and nothing else.   

**Q:**  Trindor la: I heard that there was a saying which said, "Look how poor we are in this life ; look at the folds of the leather bag" [Tib. མི་ཚེའི་སྐྱིད་སྡུག་ལ་གཟིགས་དང། ཁོམ་འབོག་ལྟེབས་རྩེག་ལ་གཟིགས་དང]. This means the folds of the leather bag shows that the bag has little things in it, right?   

**A:**  Yes, this was because our bedding was small. Dr Golstein's note: He said at the end of his discussion that after the Mönlam and <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཚོགས་མཆོད] The large religious prayer festival held in Lhasa in the 2nd Tibetan lunar month.">Tsongjö</a>, the shanggo shingnyer has to throw a linga [Tib. གླིང་ག] party for all the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. དགེ་གཡོག] Monk assistant to the disciplinary official (gegö) in monasteries.">geyog</a> and at this time, the tea has to be so thick that a <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཏམ་ཀ་དཀར་པོ] A unit in the traditional Tibetan currency system that was equal to 4 sang. Also a silver coin.">trangga garpo</a> would float on the grease [Tib. ཞག] and when they actually do this, they throw a trangga garpo in the tea and make sure that it is thick enough. End of the Interview.
