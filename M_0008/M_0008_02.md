**A:**  My parents had 8 children.   

**Q:**  Were you farmers?   

**A:**  No, my father was a kind of in charge of the Dalai Lama's stable, Chibyog Chenmo [Tib. chibs g.yog chen mo]. When the main riding horses needs a change of shoes, the stable boy would come to call him and he did this, but he didn't need to shoe the other horses and he gets tips from the gag.   

**Q:**  How many people were there in your family?   

**A:**  There were ten; eight children and two parents. The eldest and youngest were girls, the six in between were boys.   

**Q:**  Where you the eldest boy?   

**A:**  The eldest died, I was the 2nd eldest.   

**A:**  A woman speaking: The eldest daughter was the lady of the household called Kokhang [Tib. ko khang] in Lhasa.   

**Q:**  Were you belonged to Drepung as their miser [Tib. mi khungs]?   

**A:**  No. Our lord [Tib. dpon po] was Kündeling [Tib. kun bde gling].   

**Q:**  How did your parents make you to become a monk?   

**A:**  We had to pay mibo every year to Kündeling, so my parents asked permission from them to make me a monk and then made me a monk.   

**Q:**  What was the aim in making you a monk?   

**A:**  At that time, the parents would try their best to make sons monks. We had 6 sons, only one became a layman to look after the family. The other 5 were made monks. I became a Deyang monk because traditionally Thambag [Tib. dan 'bag] village was belonged to Deyang.   

**A:**  Woman speaking: Probably, it is considered much more beneficial for the next life if you are a monk in this life.   

**Q:**  Who made your 1st monk's robes?   

**A:**  My parents. They made my complete set of monk's robe. My late mother made me a monk in the shag of my maternal uncle who was her younger brother. He became my gegen.   

**Q:**  He was not the abbot, right?   

**A:**  Yes. His name is Gyentsen Künga [Tib. rgyal mtshan kun dga'], he is still living at Nam [Tib. gnam] village. Now he is in his 80s.   

**Q:**  How old are you?   

**A:**  I'm 58, born [in 1933] in the Dog Year.   

**Q:**  Goldstein: I am 53 years old, but I don't have any experience. Your first gegen was the food giving gegen, toter gegen [Tib. lto ster dge rgan], right?   

**A:**  Yes, my maternal uncle was the one what you call the toter gegen or the one who took me to abbot to cut the tuft of hair that is left on the shaved head for becoming a monk [Tib. skra phud phul].   

**Q:**  How long did you live with your uncle?   

**A:**  Probably, I lived with my uncle for 7-8 years. My maternal uncle became the chagdamba [Tib. phyag dam pa] who is the position next to the shengo. His colleague at the time was Chagdamba Ugyan la [Tib. o rgyan lags]. The infamous thief Kangtsug [Tib. rkang btsugs] was caught by them. Later, my uncle became some kind of in charge of the miser, miser gopa, [Tib. mi ser 'go pa] at Nam Village where there were many miser of the Lama Rigdra [Tib. bla ma rigs grwa] consisted of 6 abbots.   

**Q:**  At that time, did you go with him?   

**A:**  No. I stayed in the monastery. After that, my gegen lost his celibacy and took a wife. Because of this, we three young gidru were left in the monastery with no gegen. Seeing this that we had no gegen to teach us or look after our livelihood, my father came and took the three of us to the Deyang abbot and asked him to take us as gidru. He was related to my family and agreed to accept us. This is how we came to the labrang. The abbot was a learned geshe.   

**Q:**  Was the abbot a trüku?   

**A:**  No, he was a learned geshe.   

**Q:**  When your gegen became the miser gopa, who looked after you in the shag in Drepung?   

**A:**  There were three of us, the gidru. Myself and two elder brothers. Seeing there was no one taking care of us, at seeing this, my father asked the abbot to accept us three for his gidru and he agreed. When the abbot died, we gave back our other shag and took our belongings and returned to the labrang quarters in Deyang.   

**Q:**  How many years did you live with the abbot?   

**A:**  Probabaly, I lived with the abbot for about 10 years.   

**Q:**  What were your daily duties at that time?   

**A:**  I just acted as a servant for the abbot. He taught us daily 4 words from the scriptures, which we had to learn by heart or we wouldn't get the pag. [laughter] I had a hard time since I wasn't so smart. My two elder brothers did well, but I couldn't do this learning business.   

**Q:**  What did you do when your former gegen was absent?   

**A:**  Nothing, When alms were distributed, we went to tshog otherwise we played and roamed around [Tib. 'khrab].   

**Q:**  In day time, did you have something to play in the monastery?   

**A:**  We played around like small kids.   

**Q:**  The gegö didn't scold you when you were playing around?   

**A:**  No. They are only interested in what you do during the tsog.   

**Q:**  After becoming a gidru of the abbot did you start studies?   

**A:**  Yes. I started with the Tibetan alphabet. My two older brothers did well and knew more when we joined the abbot's shag, but I had to start with ka kha. But in the end I got a little command of reading but not much else.   

**Q:**  What daily work did you do for the abbot?   

**A:**  We did cleaning of rooms, making water offerings. The floor especially had to be cleaned by stepping on a piece of cloth, dogchi [Tib. rdog 'phyid] until you could see your face in it.   

**Q:**  What your other daily duties or work?   

**A:**  When there is tsog we go to the tsog. Then we had to make food for the abbot. Apart from these, since it was a big labrang, there were many additional duties they came up, e.g. we acted as receivers when visitors came to see the abbot, serving food etc.   

**Q:**  At that time, was the abbot the incumbent?   

**A:**  Yes. His name is Shenyen Tsöndrü [Tib. bshes gnyen brtson 'grus]. He was a great scholar with big eyebrows raised up like this.   

**Q:**  Did you turn over all your alms to the abbot?   

**A:**  Sure. We kept nothing for ourselves.   

**Q:**  So you were sharing the same livelihood, right?   

**A:**  Yes, the abbot took care of our living like food and clothes.   

**Q:**  Did you have to go to tsog to get your alms, or were they brought to you at the labrang?   

**A:**  We had to go. We got the abbot's share and another gidru's share for his servant, söpön [Tib. gsol dpon] but we ourselves had to go.   

**Q:**  In Deyang, did you have the custom of getting the alms shares called kelen [Tib. skal len]?   

**A:**  Yes, we had that.   

**Q:**  How did you do that?   

**Q:**  Those monks who were not able to attend the assemblies yet wanted to get their share of alms, could do so. But this had to be done through the permission of the gegö. That is kelen. They waited for their alms at the place outside the main gate of the assembly hall, gomchor [Tib. sgo 'phyor]. They didn't need to wear their cloak and after the alms were given to the common monks and the they get the shares. Once they got their share they returned home.   

**Q:**  Could you do the kelen?   

**A:**  No. kelen had to inform their reasons for being absent from tsog and after being permitted as one, they could send some one as the replacement [Tib. tshab] to get their shares on the gomchor and the distributor would give them their alms according to his list of kelen that had been made previously.   

**Q:**  Do some monks have the special privilage to get the kelen without asking for the permission?   

**A:**  No. There was no one Deyang who can get the kelen without asking for the permission. The ex-monastic officials who had the "thon" [Tib. thon] could receive their alms shares from the gomchor as the kelen. They read a list of their names.   

**Q:**  I had heard alot about the thön, but I don't understand clearly, so how could they get the thön?   

**A:**  For example, after they finish doing the shengo they get the thön which is also called thönsin [Tib. thon zin] of the ex-shengo and there were also the similar thönsin for the ex-umdze and the ex-chatsü [Tib. bya tshul] and there was also thönsin for the chöndze. They could only got the alms shares, but no shares of tea and the thukpa. The abbot was special and got not only money and grain at shag but also they brought his tea and thukpa there which is called tsabsig [Tib. tshwa gzigs]. The first serving goes for the tsog and the second serving was given to the abbot.   

**Q:**  After the death of the abbot, did you three gidru live separately?   

**A:**  Yes.   

**Q:**  What share of the shag were you given?   

**A:**  The abbot's possessions such as carpets, beddings, cupboards, tables etc. were divided among us three students.   

**Q:**  Did you divide the things?   

**A:**  The tratsang divided for us and the tratsang also gave the tonggo for the Lama Rigdra [Tib. bla ma rigs grwa] which was obliged for the late abbot to give and then the tratsang divided the remaining things among the gidru.   

**Q:**  What share did you receive?   

**A:**  I received 1 cupboard, one table, one small statue and some foodstuffs such as tsamba and tea bricks and butter. Of course private robes, both old and new, which were made for us by the abbot, we each kept. the abbot's own clothes were offered to the new abbot.   

**Q:**  When you separated, what plans did you have for your future?   

**A:**  I was only 15-16 at that time and didn't think much about the future. For a time I lived as a dobdo and later became one of Deyang's 12 chandeba [Tib. ja 'ded pa].   

**Q:**  Who appointed you chandeba?   

**A:**  The Nyertsang.   

**Q:**  Was this your own idea or that of your parents?   

**A:**  My own. My parents wouldn't be bothered with such dealings. And in any case my father had already died.   

**Q:**  What interested you in becoming a dobdo?   

**A:**  Mainly because I hated to study pecha and when I saw pecha, I see it like kind of darkness and I was happy to be a dobdo. I misbehaved badly then-I smoked and drank chang. But these were done only behind the back of the tratsang authorities such as the gegö, the shengo and abbot I would burn tsampa in a clay pot near the window of the shag when I smoke. After I came out of the monastery I didn't smoke and drink chang. Dobdo has a separate shag and courtyard and as one passed by this courtyard, you could smell the aroma of cigarettes. [laughter]   

**Q:**  Did you play dice?   

**A:**  Yes, but not in our shag. We went far away outside the circumambulation road beyond the Gomang orchard [Tib. lcang gseb]. The big boulder on the other side was the place where we practice big horn and gyaling [Tib. dung pa rgya gling] and there were earthern brick platforms [Tib. sa khri] where we sit.   

**Q:**  What did you eat for your daily meals when you lived with your uncle? Mostly was it tsampa?   

**A:**  Our staple food was tsamba. We used to have tsamba in the morning. When there were tsog, we used to eat the tsamba with the grease on the butter tea [Tib. zhag spags] served there. When there is rice gruel thukpa [Tib. thug pa spags tshos ma] was served in tsog then there was no need for us to eat tsamba when we returned to our shag.   

**Q:**  Usually, in the morning do you make fire and boil tea?   

**A:**  In the morning we make fire and boil tea.   

**Q:**  What did you eat for your lunch?   

**A:**  For the miday we go to the traja.   

**Q:**  What about dinner?   

**A:**  We make fire in our shag to cook a meal. In the evening we liked to cook thukpa bagthuk, sometimes we stewed potatoes [Tib. zhog khog mgo 'tshos] and sometimes we bought ribs with meat from a butcher and cooked it in a small clay pot.   

**Q:**  Do the Deyang have the ritual, kurim [Tib. sku rim] like Loseling?   

**A:**  These were held at night. Probably, Deyang hold the kurim for longer hours. They start about sunset and ended late at night [Tib. srod yol] [about 11 pm]. In the morning they hold the morning session, shogchö [Tib. zhogs chos], then the traja is held and then the chöra [Tib. chos ra] is held and the last was the kurim at night.   

**Q:**  Did you have to go to the kurim?   

**A:**  Yes. I was very happy to go there because we had to chant the Drölma [Tib. sgrol ma] prayer of the Tara. I knew how to recite the Drölma.   

**Q:**  Was anything served at kurim like tea?   

**A:**  No. Except the traja all the tsog were dry assembly [Tib. skam tshogs] without tea.   

**Q:**  When you were a gidru at your uncle's shag, were your meals cooked separately or the same as his?   

**A:**  First it was cooked together but later it was separate since uncle left to be the shidü.   

**Q:**  When you lived with the abbot, were the meals the same or different?   

**A:**  For the abbot we had to make his tea and food separate and clean. But we had anything we liked, because he never interfered with our meals and the shagtsang was rich then.   

**Q:**  After working as chandeba, did you become a long horn and gyaling blower?   

**A:**  Yes, my pratcice to be a long horn and gyaling player had already started when I was the chandeba.   

**Q:**  How many times in a month did you have to blow the horn?   

**A:**  There was no time limit. It depended on the frequency of the prayer chantings. Whenever a prayer chanting took place, the blowers would be ordered to play. This included rituals outside of the tratsang as well. We had to go to play the horn and the gyaling when they perform rituals for the oracles; Tenmai Simkhang [Tib. bstan ma'i gzim khang], Pushar [Tib. phu shar] and Pari Gonshar [Tib. brag ri dgon gsar ]) etc. The most important occasion was on the 10th of the 5th lunar month [Tib. tshes bcu] which was a festival for the Samye when all the oracles go there. At occasions when the oracles are in trance, the horn and gyaling blowers were also considered important and given the blessing chang from the oracle's own bowl because those oracles such as Pushar, Thambak Shanggo [Tib. dan 'bnag zhang go] Goshar Tsenkhang [Tib. sgo shar btsan khang] etc would not go into trance without the presence of monks from Deyang Tratsang performing the rituals.   

**Q:**  Who was the head of the horn blowers? And who would order or organize you to participate in these occasions?   

**A:**  Nobody. We had 12 blowers who were divided into 6 units of two each. Their duty obligation was rotated. Which month we were on duty was listed beforehand, so we knew where to go when the time came.   

**Q:**  But who would inform you? For instance, if you had to go for a ritual the next day who would give you the message?   

**A:**  The sponsor who wants to perform the ritual would inform us. For instance, if Damba Simkhang were to perform a rituals the next day, they would inform the horn and gyaling blowers .   

**Q:**  Do the horn and gyaling blowers receive any kind of wages?   

**A:**  They receive two kinds of wages; the same wages [Tib. sku yon] that the they gave the monks and the they also give is tips for buying bread [Tib. bag leb nyo yas]. The wages was handed over to the association of horn and gyaling blowers [Tib. dung pa spyi pa] for accumulating the common fund [Tib. spyi 'jog], but the tips were kept by the individuals.   

**Q:**  And they serve you the food, right?   

**A:**  Yes.   

**Q:**  They also get the gye/phog shares in the tratsang, right?   

**A:**  Yes.   

**Q:**  How long does this shöndre for blowing horn last?   

**A:**  For 12 years.   

**Q:**  After 12 years, was there any other tax?   

**A:**  No. Then we finish the shöndre.   

**Q:**  Was there any promotion of post after the 12 years?   

**A:**  No.   

**Q:**  What about the shöndre for those who didn't know blowing horn and gyaling?   

**A:**  Blowing was taught early to all young monks who did badly at studies. But those who then couldn't learn blowing, had to pay a certain amount of money as "blowing fee "phula" [Tib. phu gla] per month to the association. It was not a big amount-about equal to 6 yuan a year.   

**Q:**  What made you become a geyog? Did you ask for the geyog?   

**A:**  I myself didn't have the idea first. My sister who was living in Kokhang [Tib. ko khang] and her husband Thöndrub Norbu [Tib. don grub nor bu] who was the nyerpa of the Dalai Lama's famliy, Yabshi Tagtser [Tib. yab gzhis stag 'tsher] got the idea first. Thöndrub Norbu was released from the jail and he is still alive. The chandeba was like an ugly work among the dobdo dealing with the Olo, the tea and thukpa server in the Mönlam who were like baggars. So Thöndrub Norbu told me not to do the chandeba which is like beggar's work and he wanted me to get a better position and he informed the Jigyab khempo, [the Dalai Lama's elder brother], to do a good office [Tib. 'go 'dren] for me to become the geyog.   

**Q:**  So you didn't have the idea, by they taught you, right?   

**A:**  Yes. I had been doing chandeba for 4 years and I was a senior one and didn't have too much work and I was happy.   

**Q:**  You have to ask the shengo for the geyog position, right?   

**A:**  Yes, after I got the geyog position, I went to shengo with a khata as the ceremonial procedure [Tib. rten 'brel].   

**Q:**  Did you go to the shengo's shag?   

**A:**  Yes. Before that, one day a stable boy messenger [Tib. chib g.yog] came to me with a letter [Tib. yig chung] from the Jigyab khempo and told me to deliver it to the shengo with a scarf. I took the letter to the shengo and the shengo told me not to tell anyone about it. I got the post easily because my backer was strong. Thöndrub Norbu was in the prison in Kyangmo [Tib. rkyang mo] [a prison camp located west side of Lhasa] and was sentenced to death sentence with two-year reprieve and force labor; stay of execution [Tib. lo gnyis srog thog], but he was taken out from the prison when Lobsang Samten [Tib. blo bzang bsam gtan] and Gusung Depön came to Lhasa for the visit.   

**Q:**  What special income did the geyog get?   

**A:**  We had good income, but first, each geyog had to give the shengo 50 dotse as the bribe for granting the post [Tib. sybabs rten].   

**Q:**  Did you have to give this?   

**A:**  Yes.   

**Q:**  Where do you get 50 dotse from?   

**A:**  I borrowed it from Deyang Tratsang,s office called Nyerdzö [Tib. gnyer mdzod]. Then we had to give another 75 dotse to the shengo as the donation for the donggo [like a forced donation] at the end of his term. The main income for the geyog was the 14 shares of alms received at Mönlam, but the income and the expenditure would not get balanced because we also had to buy the regular clothes and the clothes to dress up [Tib. gzab spros] etc for the job out of our own money.   

**Q:**  What were your other incomes out of the 14 alms shares? Didn't you have the chance to take the double shares of salary?   

**A:**  Sometimes, the geyog were able to hide some child monks under their shawls and take them back into the line where the alms are being given and make the child monks to get the alms and when the child monks reached the outer gate after receiving their 2nd alms, the geyog would take the money from them without being sighted by others. We would do this several rounds and the more of this you can do, the more profit you get. This way we made some extra money, but this was a bit risky since if the sponsor saw this cheating we would lose face.   

**Q:**  Did the amounts of money [50 and 75 dotse] change according to different conditions or different individuals?   

**A:**  No. The 50 dotse was fixed for all, but the 75 dotse varied according to one location of work sites like the courtyard, [Tib. 'khyam ra] and the east middle circumambulation site, Barkor Shar [Tib. bar skor shar] and west middle circumambulation site, Barkor Nub [Tib. bar skor nub] etc. The price of donation depended on the site you were assigned. The best place like the one who watches the labrangtang [Tib. bla brang steng] [where the Laja office is liocated] paid the almost twice that of the others because a lot of income could be earned from stealing things in collaboration with the sweepers of the Laja Office. The other geyog didn't have the chance to steal except they could get the double shares.   

**Q:**  How much would the geyog of the labrangtang pay?   

**A:**  They would pay the double amount. And they would collaborate with the sweepers and the clerks [Tib. jo lags] of the Laja [and steal things] and had a good income. So this site was also grabbed by finding backers. I had a strong backer, but I didn't grab for the site and I stayd in a worse place all the time.   

**Q:**  If a geyog wanted to continue the next year, did he have to pay again?   

**A:**  Yes. And we had to request the shengo for the position again by finding backers.   

**Q:**  Normally, would you get the 2nd year?   

**A:**  It depended on the supporter you were relying upon. My supporter was Yabshi so I was sure to get the post. Some who didn't have firm backing would often lose the post. They try again and after a 5-6 years, they would manage to get the post again and some get it after 1 year. So different geyog faced different situations.   

**Q:**  If the revolt hadn't take place, what were your plans?   

**A:**  My sister and her husband were already appointed as dzongpön of Chayül [Tib. ja yul] and I was to go with them as their servant.   

**Q:**  Where is Chayül located?   

**Q:**  Chayül is located at the southern border. The post was for 6 years. Everything was ready for departure, even layman clothes and saddle wares for the horses. When I was to come back from Chayül, Yabshi was going to give me the position of shanggo shingnyer [Tib. zhang go shing gnyer] which is the head [Tib. dpon po] of the 19 geyog, but because of the revolt it was toppled. [laughter]   

**Q:**  What were the responsibilities of the shanggo shingnyer?   

**A:**  His job was very important. He almost took all the responsibilities of the tsog during the Mönlam. The 2 tsogchen shengo were mere figureheads compared to him where the shengo just erects his sceptre [Tib. lcags rgyug] and read the prayer requesting list. They just sat on their throne and did nothing while the shanggo shingnyer controlled the order and and proceedings of all the tsog and especially controls the times of the tsog like the morning tsog, [Tib. zhogs tshogs] the midday tsog [Tib. dgung tshigs] at the Dharma Teaching Grove, Sungchö Rawa [Tib. gsung chos ra ba] and the evening tsog. If a service was delayed he would be punished. And he also would tell the Ragyapa [Tib. rags rgyab pa], the untouchable low cast people who carry the dead bodies of the beggars to yell the chuke to start the tsog and inspect the taste, heat and service time for tea and thukpa. He took charge over the 19 geyog, though the geyog had their own places of duty he instructed them with detailed orders each morning. He had very good income from embezzling [Tib. za sgo]. When he came to the kitchen he would stand up on top of a huge skin bag/load of butter that weighted about 12 khe. The butter belonged to him and at the end of Mönlam he would take it home.   

**Q:**  Would he get this everyday?   

**A:**  No, he gets one skin bag/load of butter during the Mönlam and he would leave the butter load there until the Mönlam is over.   

**Q:**  There might be many other embezzlings?   

**A:**  The shanggo shingnyer has a great deal of embezzling. Whenever a thief was caught by the shengo, the possessions they seized from him would be divided into two halves, one half for shanggo shingnyer and the other for the 2 shengo. Also fines and confiscated things from other rule violators such as smoking and drinking chang and singing song and opera, were also shared into two parts by shanggo shingnyer and the two shengo. shanggo shingnyer gets larger share than the sheyno since they are 2 and he is 1. The shanggo shingnyer's shares at Mönlam must have been about 30.   

**Q:**  Were the shanggo shingnyer and geyog allowed to wear soots [Tib. sre nag] on their faces?   

**A:**  Yes. Only the geyog did, not the shanggo shingnyer. We also wore silk red bands on the biseps of our arm, tsadam [Tib. rtswa sdem]. When I was the geyog, they took alot of photoes, but later there was not much left because it was burnt.   

**Q:**  How many alms shares would the shanggo shingnyer get?   

**A:**  The shanggo shingnyer probably would get around 30 shares. I am wondering how much he gets.   

**Q:**  If the shanggo shingnyer scold the geyog, for example, on what kind of matters would the shanggo shingnyer scold the geyog?   

**A:**  He would not scold them in the morning, in the evening after the evening tea was over, the shanggo shingnyer gave instructions to us and when the monks sit for the debate, thamja [Tib. dam bca'] of geshe was over, the geyog would gather together which was called tsenyug [Tib. ?].   

**Q:**  What do you mean by tsenyug?   

**A:**  In the geyog office, they had set up a high throne for the shanggo shingnyer and below him the 4 senior geyog called drepa [Tib. bgres pa] would be seated. Below that, the second four elders called kentsampa [Tib. ske mtshams pa] would be seated, the 4 geyog of middle positions calld batsalaga [Tib. bar tsa la ga] who wore dark shawls would be seated and lastly the 4 common geyog who wore red shawls would be seated according to their seniority. Then the tsenyug would start. At this meeting, each geyog would do the self confession [Tib. rang skyon ngos len] of his work mistakes occured in one's sites on the first tsog, second tsog and the third tsog and delays of duty to to the shanggo shingnyer and the 4 drepa. The 4 kentshamba acted as the representatives for the shengo by being aware of any mistake of the geyog would make and fine the geyog.   

**Q:**  What would the 4 drepa do?   

**A:**  The 4 drepa were next to the shanggo shingnyer and they would scold the geyog alot. They were the ones who carry thin sticks. The 4 drepa were high ranked [Tib. go gnas mtho po] and they wouldn't get fined and they didn't have heavy duties on the sites and they would just over see us because the new geyog had to go to all the worst sites.   

**Q:**  Did the 4 elders supervise the work in the kitchen?   

**A:**  No. They were not allowed to meddle into this. The kitchen work was taken charge of by the shanggo shingnyer, the simgag, the Tashi Khangsar and the Jama.   

**Q:**  How did the tshenyug operate? Please tell us an example about that.   

**A:**  The 4 kentsamba, in the presence of the shanggo shingyer would tell the 10 common geyog to stand up and we have to bend our body and they would ask us about what happened on that day and we confess about the happenings of the day.   

**Q:**  Could you give us a detailed example of such a telling of a mistake?   

**A:**  For example, the incident I told you about when I knocked out the two monks, is one such thing. I would make a full report as to how they approached me and how I smacked them with my stick (pole), and how they had to be carried off, etc. In my report I said I didn't know whether they were alive or dead.   

**Q:**  What would they say then?   

**A:**  They would say it was right for me to do that if the monks misbehaved against me. Of course, if the two had died, I would have had to pay 2 chegye as a fine.   

**Q:**  What were the some other events?   

**A:**  It was like the events where the monks shout "chu" chushargyag [Tib. chu shar rgyag] and then whistle and fight in my site, then I report that today the monks whistled and did those things.   

**Q:**  Why would they whistle?   

**A:**  This is for causing trouble [Tib. dkrog rkyen slong] and some also would jeer. So I would say."today some monks jeered, whistled and fought in my site, so I beat them with my stcik". I had to report in detail. If I didn't report clearly there were some other geyog watching me and they would tell it. As for the fine the geyog pay, had to be chegye coins only. So we had to go to exchange chegye from the peddlers.   

**Q:**  In what instances would a geyog be fined?   

**A:**  For e.g., if a geyog couldn't put down a disturbance such as the dobdo jeering or whistling, or if there are delays in his work, etc. Fines would be 5 tranka, 10 chegye or 20 chegye. They also had to confess if one was late in the tsog.   

**Q:**  After the tsog were over, did you still have the authority for keeping order outside?   

**A:**  Yes, but outside people would be afraid of us and run away, so we had no trouble.   

**Q:**  Would the geyog make your shoulder higher by putting on something padded [Tib. o bog] on your shoulder?   

**A:**  Only the shengo have that and we geyog don't, but the geyog would wear the satin vest [Tib. gos chen stod 'gag]   

**Q:**  Would you mostly stay in the tsog during the Mönlam?   

**A:**  Yes. We had to stand there carrying the stick.   

**Q:**  Were the monks mischievious and cause alot of trouble?   

**A:**  The worst of all was to keep watch at the site Dayabwog [Tib. mda' g.yab 'og] as the monks there, were completely dobdo and this site was law less [Tib. khrims med lugs med]. All the geyog would say that they don't want this place.   

**Q:**  Trindor la: khyamra and shingra were better, but in Dayabwog where you were the geyog, they don't recite prayers and they were always shouting, right?   

**A:**  Yes, khyamra and those sites were quite. But in Dayabwog, there was nobdy startig the prayers and they also fight and hit each other's heads with the back side of their bowl [Tib. phor ltag] and they would also take out the big false key [Tib. lde rdzus] attached with a iron ring and hit each other with the sound "shang shang".   

**Q:**  If you sighted this, would you have to go to beat them right away?   

**A:**  Yes. [laughter]   

**Q:**  Trindor la; In the times in between the tsog you have to go for inspection of the hygiene of the Barkor by yelling "Wo-cho-cho" [Tib.?] which means, "make way." The people were deadly afraid when your inspection party arrived, right?   

**A:**  Yes. In the evenings, the geyog led by the chagdamba would go for inspection of the hygiene of the Barkor, and if any dirt or urine or stool was sighted at the corner of a street, the household who was supposed to be in charge of sweeping this corner would be made to lay down and beaten with switches on the spot. The thabyog would carry bundles of switches at this inspection under their armpit, which were to be used for beating.   

**Q:**  Would you bring lots of the switches?   

**A:**  Yes.   

**Q:**  When the Mönlam was over, did the geyog have any other duties?   

**A:**  No. We became ordinary monks.   

**Q:**  Were the 19 geyog posts allocated to the various tratsang or what?   

**A:**  Two geyog came from each of Deyang and Ngagpa Tratsang. The other 15 were selected from Loseling and Gomang.   

**Q:**  When Mönlam was over, did the geyog have to give any donation to the monastery?   

**A:**  No.   

**Q:**  Did the shengo have to give the donggo?   

**A:**  Yes.   

**Q:**  What about the chagdamba and shanggo shingnyer?   

**A:**  None for them.   

**Q:**  Was the chagdamba and shanggo shingnyer appointed by the shengo? Would they have to ask for it?   

**A:**  Yes.   

**Q:**  What was the differece between the shanggo shingnyer and chagdamba's duties?   

**A:**  The chagdamba would do all the harder works ffor the shengo and was like the shengo's servant. Whenever the shengo had any work to do, he would tell the chagdamba to do it. The chagdamba held a sceptre [Tib. lcags rgyugs] and looked very grand. We geyog only pretended to be respectful; to him outwardly, but in fact we treated him as the same as ourselves because we considered that both the geyog and chagdamba had asked for the position by giving the same khata and were appointed by the shengo. But the geyog paid a lot of respect to the shanggo shingnyer because he was completely in charge of the geyog.   

**Q:**  How many different kinds of monks could one find in a monastery? Some were pechawa and some were dobdo. Were there many dobdo?   

**A:**  There were alot of dobdo. There were pechawa, dobdo, traders, shidü, monastic officials, lene [Tib. las sne] such as chabu, nyertsang and tratsang jama, chabril, caretakers [Tib. dkon gnyer] etc.   

**Q:**  Leaving aside those monks outside of the monastery, how many monks would be present daily in Drepung?   

**A:**  Before the revolt, in Drepung there were so many monks like a big group of incects [Tib. 'bu 'khor ba]. Traditionally there were supposed to have been 7700 monks, but in fact Loseling alone had that many.   

**Q:**  In the past, supposing one day I go to Drepung all of a sudden, how many monks would there be staying in the monastery?   

**A:**  Most of the monks would stay in the monastery. The number of monk's staying in the monastery would be approximately 7700. The khamtsen were very crowded and the monk population was as dense as an anthill when the tsog is held. But now its made quite pleasing to the eye from the front but at the back all have become ruins Great buildings like Drepung Jiso and Tardong Jikhang [Tib. star sdong spyi khang] of Deyang were dynamited and razed to the ground.   

**Q:**  When you were a monk, if you want to go to Lhasa, did you have to ask for leave?   

**A:**  No.   

**Q:**  If the monks wanted to go for a long distance journey did they ask for leave?   

**A:**  Yes, they have to because they couldn't attend the tsog.   

**Q:**  Who gave them permission?   

**A:**  The gegö.   

**Q:**  If a monk wanted to spend one night in Lhasa did he have to ask for a leave?   

**A:**  No. Nobody would know he was out, especially the dobdo never go to the tsog unless there were gye/phog. So nobody would know they were out or in and they wouldn't pay attention to us.   

**Q:**  How did you lagyüba learn the Buddhist doctrines ? For instance, you became a monk for praticing what the Buddha and Tsongkhapa [Tib. tsong kha pa] had said, right ?   

**A:**  We were supposed to do that.   

**Q:**  If so, who would teach you those things?   

**A:**  If every monk know pecha, there would be nobody serving the monks. The ones who practice religion and the ones who work were combined together.   

**Q:**  So you people don''t know pecha, right?   

**A:**  Yes, but we were serving them.   

**Q:**  We were told that there was a fight between lagyüba and pechawa just before the revolt at Gomang. Is this true, and why?   

**A:**  Yes, they did that and it was in deed a bad omen [Tib. sdug rtags]. Even the Gomang umdze was tied to a pillar by the common monks. There were two groups and I didn't know in detail because we were in different tratsang. When we heard that they fought, we were just saying "they should fight", not knowing the reason.   

**Q:**  When the dobdo tobtsang was dismissed were there any objections among the dobdo saying that they should leave the tobtsang as it was?   

**A:**  No. The purpose of the tobtsang was for doing the 12 events of male sports [Tib. pho rtsal rnam grangs bcu gnyis] competition and we and Sera Ngagpa both party practiced the 12 events male sports and usually, the two parties would challenge each other. But when we challenged Sera Ngagpa, they refused and said that their dobdo tobtsang was already dismissed. Since there was no opponent, our tobtsang thought that there was no further need for our existence. So we also followed their example and we did the Lhagyel Chogyag [Tib. lha rgyal phyogs rgyag] and yelled "may the god be victorious" [Tib. lha rgyal 'then] and dismissed our tobtsang and we gave all our belongings to the tratsang.   

**Q:**  Did only Deyang and Ngagpa dismissed the tobtsang ?   

**A:**  All of them did that except Drepung Ngagba who didn't have tobtsang and they didn't have many dobdo. It was formerly understood that the tobtsang's chogyag could avoid wars and famines!   

**Q:**  Who planned the dismissal of dobdo tobtsang?   

**A:**  For us the order was given by Drepung laji and the Yigtsang had given order to the laji.   

**Q:**  Who do you think was the one who first had the idea of dismissing the tobtsang? Was it tratsang or the laji?   

**A:**  The laji made the plan and gave the order to the tratsang.   

**Q:**  Laji means the abbots and the ex-abbots, right?   

**A:**  Yes.   

**Q:**  When you first became the geyog, you have to go to Potala to have the audinece and they would serve you droma dresi, right? At that time, who would pass down the order [Tib. bka' sgyur]?   

**A:**  The Yigtsang would pass down the order to the shengo and shanggo shingnyer.   

**Q:**  When shengo went to Lhasa for Mönlam did he take the 5th Dalai Lama's charter, jayig [Tib. bca' yig] from Drepung?   

**A:**  Yes. They always kept the jayig in Drepung. The Mönlam starts on the 3rd and we go down on the 2nd where we would meet the regent on the way, we were not allowed to dismount our horse and we just go by the side. Usually, everybody have to dismount their horse when they meet the regent.   

**Q:**  Trindor la. After the shengo visit the Dalai Lama, the procession of shengo would go to Lhasa via the circumambulation road around the city Lingkor [Tib. gling skor] to Ramoche Temple for a pilgrimage. But they weren't allowed to go via the stupa Bhago Kaling [Tib. brag sgo kar ne] [located in front of Potala.   

**A:**  Yes, we come down through the upper horse road behind the Potala [Tib. rta lam gong ma].   

**Q:**  Do all the monks go this way?   

**A:**  Only the shengo and the geyog. And then we go for the Barkor and then the monk who do the prayers for propitiating the Karmashag [Tib. skar ma shag] deity, gombo [Tib. dpon po ba] would come out. Then we go to Nangtsesha to take over the judicial poles [Tib. khrims rgyug]. Then we give the order to the Karma shag gombo on the prohibitions during the Mönlam.   

**Q:**  When you take over the Nangtsesha would the mipön come?   

**A:**  No. The sweepers come. We first go for the hygiene patrolling to Dinggung Chumik [Tib. lding gung chu mig] and ordered the well to be kept clean during the Mönlam. This was done because during the the Mönlam, the water for the Jokhang gate Sera Tago [Tib. ltag sgo] was taken from here. After that, we go to Nangtsesha to take over the court [Tib. khrims ra].   

**Q:**  What do you take over?   

**A:**  We take over the two judicial poles hung on two sides of the door. This pole had a strapped design [Tib. khra khra].   

**Q:**  Where would the geyog sleep at night?   

**A:**  All slept in the Geyog khang [office]. Not a single geyog was permitted to sleep outside. The shanggo shingnyer slept in the Geyog khang also. All a geyog owned was a leather bag called khombok [Tib. khom 'bog] in which his bedding and other belongs were kept in. All the leather bags were lined up neatly there.   

**Q:**  I heard that when a geyog was expelled his leather bag was thrown out. Is this true?   

**A:**  Yes. If a geyog made a serious mistake, the leather bag would be thrown out and then it is finished. Because all he owned was a leather bag and nothing else.   

**Q:**  Trindor la: I heard that there was a saying which said, "Look how poor we are in this life ; look at the folds of the leather bag" [Tib. mi tshe'i skyid sdug la gzigs dang/ khom 'bog ltebs rtseg la gzigs dang]. This means the folds of the leather bag shows that the bag has little things in it, right?   

**A:**  Yes, this was because our bedding was small. Dr Golstein's note: He said at the end of his discussion that after the Mönlam and Tsongjö, the shanggo shingnyer has to throw a linga [Tib. gling ga] party for all the geyog and at this time, the tea has to be so thick that a trangga garpo would float on the grease [Tib. zhag] and when they actually do this, they throw a trangga garpo in the tea and make sure that it is thick enough.
