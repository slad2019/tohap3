**Q:**  Tell me about the additional tax called <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཞིབ་འཕར] 1. An extra tax levied by Lungshar on monastic and aristocratic estates. 2. The office stated by Lungshar to collect this extra tax.">shimbar</a> that was imposed on <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. བཀྲ་སིས་ལྷུན་པོ] The famous Gelugpa Monastery of the Panchen Lama located in Shigatse.">Tashilhunpo</a>?   

**A:**  Yes, they imposed the Shimbar on <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. བཀྲ་སིས་ལྷུན་པོ] The famous Gelugpa Monastery of the Panchen Lama located in Shigatse.">Tashilhunpo</a>. This work was done by <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ལུང་ཤར] The family name of a famous aristocratic lay official during the time of the 13th Dalai Lama and the Regent Reting.">Lungshar</a>. At that time Lungshar probably hated Tashilhunpo a little bit and he was slightly rude [Tib. འར་པོ] to them. I heard that Tashilhunpo was obliged to pay 5,500 <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཁལ] A traditional volume measurement used for measuring grain in traditional Tibetan society. Sizes of this unit varied somewhat, but the official government khe (called mkhar ru or bstan dzin mkha ru) weighed about 28-31 pounds for barley. It was used to convey the size of fields. For example, a field said to be 10 khe in size meant that 10 khe of seed could be sown on that field.">khe</a> of grain for the Shimbar tax. Before that, there wasn't any talk about the Shimbar, so they were surprised to have to pay 5,500 khe of grain that year and thought that they wee being taxed a great deal. As far as we [his family] were concerned, in the beginning we had to pay 2,500 khe as the Shimbar tax. So we were also astonished and thought how can we pay that much every year. At that time our older servants were saying that we can not pay that much so we submitted a petition. We had lost 9 aristocrats estates (Tib. གེརཁག [སྒེར་ཁག]) that had been under our jurisdiction. So they also submitted a petition saying <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. བསམ་ཕོ] The abbreviated name of one of the largest and most powerful aristocratic families (Samdru Phodrang).">Sambo</a> is appealing that they cannot pay 2,500 khe for the Shimbar tax so please give us Sambo's property and we will pay a tax of 5,000 khe of grain. Consequently, an Investigation Committee was appointed and Lungshar investigated the case. At that time, my late father might have been young and probably he was slightly impudent [Tib. ཞལ་རྒྱགས་པ] toward Lungshar and that caused Lungshar to get angry and he demoted my father from the Theiji position.   

**Q:**  Was he a Theiji at that time?   

**A:**  Yes. We had a land tenure document called Cholo [Tib. ཆོ་ལོ] which indicated we were granted the Theiji rank from generation to generation. Then <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ལུང་ཤར] The family name of a famous aristocratic lay official during the time of the 13th Dalai Lama and the Regent Reting.">Lungshar</a> told us, "If you are saying that you can't pay 2,500 <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཁལ] A traditional volume measurement used for measuring grain in traditional Tibetan society. Sizes of this unit varied somewhat, but the official government khe (called mkhar ru or bstan dzin mkha ru) weighed about 28-31 pounds for barley. It was used to convey the size of fields. For example, a field said to be 10 khe in size meant that 10 khe of seed could be sown on that field.">khe</a>, the nine aristocrats are telling us to give <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. བསམ་ཕོ] The abbreviated name of one of the largest and most powerful aristocratic families (Samdru Phodrang).">Sambo</a>'s property to them and they will pay 5,000 khe of grain as the Shimbar tax. So you should pay 5,000 khe of grain." So the 9 aristocrats lost the case but we had to pay double the original tax. Then we submitted a petition again to the government. This was the time of the 13th Dalai Lama. We wrote in the petition, "We, are an old family from whom a Dalai Lama has been identified. We have to pay 5,000 khe of Shimbar tax, but we cannot charge more for our lease fees to the people who took our lands as a permanent lease because they had the endorsement [Tib. རྒྱབ་སྣོན] of the Dalai Lama's seal [Tib. སྦུག་དམ] and the seal of the Kashag and our own seal indicating that we were not allowed to increase the lease fee. So there was no way to increase the lease fee. Therefore, we appealed to the government to take back all of our property and please grant us a basis for making our living [Tib. འཚོ་རྟེན] as an old family of the Dalai Lama." The response to this appeal said, "You don't need to adhere to the [old] endorsements and you can levy taxes on newly opened fields [Tib. བབཤི] like other people. Anyway, you have to pay 5,000 khe of grain." So we had to ask for leave for 6-7 months to levy the taxes on the newly opened fields and create a source of income. Actually, to tell you the truth, we ended up getting more that 5,000 khe [in new income]. We got probably 20,000-30,000 khe. So we could pay 5,000 khe of grain for the Shimbar and still had some left over. Likewise, <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. བཀྲ་སིས་ལྷུན་པོ] The famous Gelugpa Monastery of the Panchen Lama located in Shigatse.">Tashilhunpo</a> also yelled in anguish at having to pay 5,500 khe of grain. When they went to the fields and organized sources for paying the tax, Tashilhunpo, which was much bigger than us, probably didn't need to complain about paying 5,500 khe. However, when all of a sudden they were told to pay 5,500 khe, they might have been astonished. We also had the same feeling. Similarly, there were also others like Surkhang who were ordered to pay the Shimbar. All of them were obliged to pay that.   

**Q:**  There was a reason for <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. བཀྲ་སིས་ལྷུན་པོ] The famous Gelugpa Monastery of the Panchen Lama located in Shigatse.">Tashilhunpo</a> to pay the one-fourth military salary [Tib. དམག་ཕོགས་བཞི་ཟུར], but what was the reason for them to pay 5,500 <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཁལ] A traditional volume measurement used for measuring grain in traditional Tibetan society. Sizes of this unit varied somewhat, but the official government khe (called mkhar ru or bstan dzin mkha ru) weighed about 28-31 pounds for barley. It was used to convey the size of fields. For example, a field said to be 10 khe in size meant that 10 khe of seed could be sown on that field.">khe</a>? Did you see their documents?   

**A:**  I didn't see their documents. Actually, 5,500 <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཁལ] A traditional volume measurement used for measuring grain in traditional Tibetan society. Sizes of this unit varied somewhat, but the official government khe (called mkhar ru or bstan dzin mkha ru) weighed about 28-31 pounds for barley. It was used to convey the size of fields. For example, a field said to be 10 khe in size meant that 10 khe of seed could be sown on that field.">khe</a> was not enough .   

**Q:**  How did you know that they had to pay 5,500 <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཁལ] A traditional volume measurement used for measuring grain in traditional Tibetan society. Sizes of this unit varied somewhat, but the official government khe (called mkhar ru or bstan dzin mkha ru) weighed about 28-31 pounds for barley. It was used to convey the size of fields. For example, a field said to be 10 khe in size meant that 10 khe of seed could be sown on that field.">khe</a>?   

**A:**  Kapshö <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ས་དབང་ཆེན་མོ] One of the heads of the Kashag [bka&#x27; shag] or Council of Ministers. Sawangchemmo was also a term of address for a Kalön/Shape.">Sawangchemmo</a> [Tib. ཀ་ཤོད་ས་དབང་ཆེན་མོ] told me this. He said, "<a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. བཀྲ་སིས་ལྷུན་པོ] The famous Gelugpa Monastery of the Panchen Lama located in Shigatse.">Tashilhunpo</a> is complaining [Tib. སྡུག་སྐད] a lot about having to pay 5,500 <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཁལ] A traditional volume measurement used for measuring grain in traditional Tibetan society. Sizes of this unit varied somewhat, but the official government khe (called mkhar ru or bstan dzin mkha ru) weighed about 28-31 pounds for barley. It was used to convey the size of fields. For example, a field said to be 10 khe in size meant that 10 khe of seed could be sown on that field.">khe</a> and your household is paying 5,000 khe. So there is only 500 difference. But, they were claiming like this and the Panchen Lama also had to run away."   

**Q:**  When did Kapshö tell you this?   

**A:**  Probably he told me in 1949 or 1950 or 1951. I don't remember clearly. Anyway, it was at the time of, or just after, Tibet was liberated. The two of us just had a casual talk. When it was said that we couldn't pay 2,500 <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཁལ] A traditional volume measurement used for measuring grain in traditional Tibetan society. Sizes of this unit varied somewhat, but the official government khe (called mkhar ru or bstan dzin mkha ru) weighed about 28-31 pounds for barley. It was used to convey the size of fields. For example, a field said to be 10 khe in size meant that 10 khe of seed could be sown on that field.">khe</a>, it seemed that it would be impossible to give 5,000 khe, but when we went to the estates and collected the grain tax from the local places, the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. མི་སེར] A term that can mean serf/bound subject as well as citizen, depending on context. For example, the miser of a lord would connote the bound subjects of that lord, whereas the miser of Tibet would connote citizens of Tibet.">miser</a> were also not complaining about it.   

**Q:**  Before the 9 "aristocrats" got out from under you, how many estates did <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. བསམ་ཕོ] The abbreviated name of one of the largest and most powerful aristocratic families (Samdru Phodrang).">Sambo</a> have?   

**A:**  The estate called Dranang [Tib. གྲ་ནང] was the main salary estate for the Dalai Lama's family (Tib. ཁྱོངདེབ [འཁྱོངས་ཐེབས]). After that, the family appealed that this was not enough for their income so as additional salary estates there got Sangri [Tib. ཟངས་རི], Tranggo [Tib. འཕྲང་སྒོ], and Kyishong [Tib. སྐྱིད་གཤོངས] In the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. མཚོ་སྣ] A district in southern Tibet.">Tsöna</a> area, there was Deu [Tib. རྡེའུ] Gadag [Tib. ག་དག].   

**Q:**  So were there 9 aristocrats [who used to be under Sambo], right?   

**A:**  Yes. They belonged to Dranang. In the Dranang area, there were 306-307 <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. འདོན] A volume measurement used for fields on aristocratic and religious manorial estates. One dön was equal to two gang.">dön</a> [Tib. འདོན] of land. In that area, there were also some monasteries like Dingmoche [Tib. ལྡིང་མོ་ཆེ] and Gyamin Tsokhag [Tib. ?]. Dranang Dzong was in charge of enforcing the law [Tib. ཁྲིམས་འགོ་ཁྲིམས་གནོན]. In Dranang, there were many aristocratic and monastic estates.   

**Q:**  <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. བསམ་ཕོ] The abbreviated name of one of the largest and most powerful aristocratic families (Samdru Phodrang).">Sambo</a> had 300 <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. འདོན] A volume measurement used for fields on aristocratic and religious manorial estates. One dön was equal to two gang.">dön</a> of land, right?   

**A:**  Yes. It was ridiculous [Tib. ཁུངས་ལུང་ཡོད་མ་རེད]. I swear by the Three Jewels that the size of the land was probably like the size of the country Bhutan, though we didn't have the name of a king. [Laughter] Among the 9 aristocratic families, three became lay officials of the government: Jede [Tib. ལྕེ་བདེ], Dumbuwa [Tib. ལྡུམ་བུ་བ], and Gomo Shöntshang [Tib. སྒོ་མོ་གཞོན་ཚང྄] The remaining 6 aristocratic families didn't become lay officials: Baiyuwa [Tib. དཔལ་ཡུལ་བ], Lama Yangdag [Tib. བླ་མ་ཡང་དག]. I don't remember all of the names. They didn't become lay officials thinking that <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. བསམ་ཕོ] The abbreviated name of one of the largest and most powerful aristocratic families (Samdru Phodrang).">Sambo</a> might dislike them because they had the old relationship of <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. དཔོན་པོ, མངའ་བདག] 1. A manorial estate holder. 2. Chief of an area.">lord</a> and servants [to Sambo] for many years.   

**Q:**  They got out from under <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. བསམ་ཕོ] The abbreviated name of one of the largest and most powerful aristocratic families (Samdru Phodrang).">Sambo</a>, right?   

**A:**  Yes. They were made to get out from under Sambo.   

**Q:**  How did the nine of them get out?   

**A:**  At that time, they were talking about the history from the 5th Dalai Lama's time saying they did not belong to Sambo. Probably, they were appealing saying that they used to be [separate] aristocrats during the 5th Dalai Lama's time.   

**Q:**  Did they submit a petition?   

**A:**  Yes. They may or may not have been like this during the 5th Dalai Lama's time. Even if they were supposed to be like that, they had belonged to <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. བསམ་ཕོ] The abbreviated name of one of the largest and most powerful aristocratic families (Samdru Phodrang).">Sambo</a> from the 5th to the 7th Dalai Lama. Then we became the family of the Dalai Lama (yabshi)at the time of the 7th Dalai Lama. So it seems that they didn't have to talk and cause trouble, but at that time, <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ལུང་ཤར] The family name of a famous aristocratic lay official during the time of the 13th Dalai Lama and the Regent Reting.">Lungshar</a> probably supported them a little bit. I heard that that time Lungshar got angry because something happened and he [my late father] was demoted and made us to pay 5,000 <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཁལ] A traditional volume measurement used for measuring grain in traditional Tibetan society. Sizes of this unit varied somewhat, but the official government khe (called mkhar ru or bstan dzin mkha ru) weighed about 28-31 pounds for barley. It was used to convey the size of fields. For example, a field said to be 10 khe in size meant that 10 khe of seed could be sown on that field.">khe</a> instead of 2,500 and he lost the nine aristocratic subordinate families. We had a very bad time.   

**Q:**  What was his demotion?   

**A:**  He was demoted from Theiji to Senampa.   

**Q:**  What year was that?   

**A:**  At that time I was a small child.   

**Q:**  Were you already born?   

**A:**  Yes. I was born. Making the Babso [Tib. འབབ་བཟོ] tax was in the Snake Year. Probably, my late father was demoted in the Hare Year.   

**Q:**  That should be the Fire-Hare Year, 1927, right?   

**A:**  Probably.   

**Q:**  Goldstein. Levying taxes on the newly opened fields (Tib. བབཤི [འབབ་གཞིས]) was in 1921-22.   

**A:**  I mean when they [my family] made the tax income from Dranang, when we couldn't pay the amount that was levied, that was in the Snake Year.   

**Q:**  Probably, it took many years to do that?   

**A:**  Probably. I think there might have been some trouble. When I asked my late brother Tsögo [Tib. མཚོ་སྒོ], "How much were you obliged to pay for the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. འབབ་གཞི] The land investigation of manorial estates that was devised and conducted by Lungshar in order to raise new tax revenue from these estates for the 13th Dalai Lama&#x27;s program of modernization, especially the expansion of the army.">babshi</a>?" He just said a small amount like 400-500-600 khe. When I asked him how did that happen? He said, "This was done through a meritorious [Tib. ཚོགས་བསགས] woman." When I asked him how she did that? He said, "When she came there she was single and she probably might have served him for 1-2 nights." [sexually] and he might have given her a gift. Since he was a human, he couldn't be very fair.   

**Q:**  Lhalu and those aristocrats also got the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. འབབ་གཞི] The land investigation of manorial estates that was devised and conducted by Lungshar in order to raise new tax revenue from these estates for the 13th Dalai Lama&#x27;s program of modernization, especially the expansion of the army.">babshi</a> tax levied, right?   

**A:**  Yes, Lhalu [Tib. ལྷ་ཀླུ], Thönpa [Tib. ཐོན་པ] and <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. བཤད་སྒྲ] The name of the family of an important lay aristocratic official.">Shatra</a> [Tib. བཤད་སྒྲ] also got babshi.   

**Q:**  I heard that Lhalu was levied very lightly?   

**A:**  Probably. He might have done that a little bit.   

**Q:**  Please tell me in detail how the Reting problem started?   

**A:**  I do not know all the details, but I shall tell you on the basis of the authentic information I have. Reting was then not only the Regent, but also the senior tutor to the Dalai Lama. He told the Tsondu that he was facing personal problems in his life and he needed to go into retreat. When he insisted on this, the Tsondu is supposed to have asked him, "If you resign what shall we do?" Reting said, "There is nothing to worry about, you can ask <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. སྟག་བྲག] The regent of Tibet who replaced Reting in 1941 and served until 1950 when the 14th Dalai Lama assumed power.">Taktra</a> to succeed me." The reason why Reting wanted Taktra to succeed him was that Reting was the senior tutor and Taktra was the Junior Tutor of His Holiness, and also they had taken some teaching on the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. འཇིགས་བྱེད] The Yamantaka text.">Jigje</a> [Tib. འཇིགས་བྱེད] or the Yamantaka from the same lama . I believe they had taken the teaching together from some other lama, and they were therefore dharma friends [Tib. ཆོས་གྲོགས] since they may have even done the Jigje retreat together. I think that the main considerations of Reting when he thought of Taktra was that they were dharma friends, and also that he was old, about sixty, so Taktra would only have a few years left to live only. Considering this and the fact that Reting wanted to be away for only three years and Taktra had agreed to accept the Regency for that period of three years only.   

**Q:**  Did such talk of three years really take place?   

**A:**  Yes. it did take place. I am quite sure of it. The year of the Water Horse was during that period of three years, and this decision was sometimes at the end of the Iron-Snake year. Although I was quite young then, there was no suspicion that Reting would resign, but very suddenly it was known that Reting had resigned and that <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. སྟག་བྲག] The regent of Tibet who replaced Reting in 1941 and served until 1950 when the 14th Dalai Lama assumed power.">Taktra</a> was the new Regent. After the end of three years, I think it was in the Monkey Year, Reting came back to Lhasa and he probably hinted to Taktra that the three years were over, but there was no sign that Taktra, the old man, would lift up his butt at all.   

**Q:**  When Reting returned to Lhasa was there any conversation between the two that the three year period was over, and what about the resignation, etc.?   

**A:**  I do not know if there was such a talk, but it was said that Reting had publicly hinted that the three years period was over. The incident at Lhundrup Dzong had just taken place and when the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. སེ་ར་བྱེས] The Jey (Je) College of Sera Monastery.">Sera Jey</a> monks explained to Reting what had happened, Reting probably openly criticized the decision taken by <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. སྟག་བྲག] The regent of Tibet who replaced Reting in 1941 and served until 1950 when the 14th Dalai Lama assumed power.">Taktra</a>, saying it was not at all fair. Taktra however, did not show any intention of resigning so it was inconvenient for Reting to tell him, "Aren't you going to resign?" So Reting Rimpoche had no alternative except to return to Reting Monastery. Taktra also hated and gave quite a lot of trouble to Reting Labrang.   

**Q:**  What was the nature of this trouble?   

**A:**  As far as the decision making body, the Kashag, was concerned, there were four kalön and there were four drunyichemmmo in the Yigtsang. Before that, Reting had appointed some pro-Reting officials to those positions. When some of them died or had been removed, they were replaced by people from the wrong side [pro-<a href "#" data-tooltip "[tib. སྟག་བྲག] The regent of Tibet who replaced Reting in 1941 and served until 1950 when the 14th Dalai Lama assumed power.">Taktra</a>]. None of the new appointments were Reting's friends, and this made Reting very unhappy. And when the Reting Labrang requested some miscellaneous things from Taktra, he acted on them in the opposite way.   

**Q:**  I don't think such things happened. Were there any examples of <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. སྟག་བྲག] The regent of Tibet who replaced Reting in 1941 and served until 1950 when the 14th Dalai Lama assumed power.">Taktra</a> doing like this on miscellaneous things?   

**A:**  No, I don't have any particular incident to tell you, but since they [Reting Labrang] thought that the situation was not going to be good, I heard that a man who was quite close to Reting called Gyagpön Bu Tsering Thöndrub [Tib. བརྒྱ་དཔོན་བུ་ཚེ་རིང་དོན་གྲུབ] or Thöndrub Gyalpo [Tib. དོན་གྲུབ་རྒྱལ་པོ], I do not remember his name properly, was sent to China by Reting to contact Chiang Kaishek and request that he send soldiers. If he (Chiang Kaishek) agreed to help Reting get back the regency, then Reting would give China all the land below [east of] Chamdo. This is a bit shocking, but I heard this. Within a few weeks, I think it was in either the Sheep, Monkey, or Bird Year (1944/45), he went via the northern route to Kham and then to China. Chiang Kaishek's government was in Nanjing. That was at the time that <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཀུན་འཕེལ] The name of the favorite of the 13th Dalai Lama who became politically powerful during the later period of the 13th Dalai Lama&#x27;s reign.">Künphel</a> and Abo Raga had been expelled from India to China. It was then that Künphel had quarrels with Reting Rimpoche's representative called Simpönla [Tib. གཟིམ་དཔོན་ལགས] in Kalimpong and he is believed to have said, "If I do not destroy Reting Labrang, do not utter my name again" (Meaning - if I do not destroy Reting Labrang I am not worthy of being called Künphel). Künphel, who was very intelligent, started making investigations and found that Reting's people were trying to bargain [with Chiang Kaishek] to get him the regency back, so he informed the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. མཁན་མགྲོན་ལོ་གསུམ] The three monk officials (mkhan chung, rtse mgron, and lo rtsa ba) sent to Beijing during the Qing Dynasty by the Tibetan government to teach the Qing royal family written Tibetan so they could read prayer books. They also performed rituals for the royal family. After the Qing dynasty fell, the Tibetan government continued to station three such monk officials in Beijing where they functioned as a Bureau Office for the Tibetan government in China.">Khendrönlosum</a> officials. The Khenjung [of these three], the one who died a year ago, was Tsadora Thubden Sangpo [Tib. ཚ་རྡོ་ར་ཐུབ་བསྟན་བཟང་པོ], the tsendrön was Thubden Tshenleg [Tib. ཐུབ་བསྟན་མཚན་ལེགས] and the Lotsawa was Thubden Sangye [Tib. ཐུབ་བསྟན་སངས་རྒྱས]. I am sure they must have verified this and sent a telegram to the Tibetan government. This was a secret telegram whose first line said, "No one is allowed to read the telegram except the Kashag." The translator was the lay official Tara Dopa [Tib. རྟ་ར་མདོ་པ] who was the son of Shölkang [Tib. ཞོལ་ཁང]. When he saw the first line, he thought that it would be better not to know the content of the telegram so he put the telegram inside the code book and handed it over to the Kashag where it was translated. The telegram said, "Reting Labrang had told Chiang Kaishek to help them reinstate Reting as the Regent, and if he got reinstated, then the area below Chamdo would be given to China. If this information were to get leaked, we would be definitely get beheaded. So please do not let this information leak out."   

**Q:**  Since they were not Chinese citizens, why would they get beheaded?   

**A:**  Since there were in China and the Chinese outnumbered them, something might happen to them. This was the information sent to the Kashag by the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. མཁན་མགྲོན་ལོ་གསུམ] The three monk officials (mkhan chung, rtse mgron, and lo rtsa ba) sent to Beijing during the Qing Dynasty by the Tibetan government to teach the Qing royal family written Tibetan so they could read prayer books.

After that information was received in Lhasa, a man came to see the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཕྱག་མཛོད] A senior manager/treasurer of an aristocratic or monastic estate, or the senior manager/treasurer of an aristocratic family or a monastic unit.

It was addressed to the Regent. When no one came to collect it, the chandzö of Gyambumgang opened it and it exploded. People said that they had seen the damage to the house of the Drunyichemmo Gyambumgang caused by the explosion. Suddenly the government decided to call Reting to Lhasa and two <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཞབས་པད] One of the heads of the Kashag [bka&#x27; shag] or Council of Ministers. There were usually 4 Shape or Kalön, although in the 1950s the number increased at various times to 6 or 7. The ministers made decisions collectively and had no fixed term of office.">Shape</a>, Surkhang and Lhalu, were sent that same night to <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. གྲྭ་བཞི] 1. An area below Sera Monastery. 2. The location of the Tibetan Armory-Mint Office and the regimental headquarters of the Khadang Regiment, which was also called the Trapchi Regiment.">Trapchi</a> from where they took some soldiers and went to Reting. They reached Reting early morning at sunrise on the second or third day. When they reached the monastery they asked to see Reting. Reting asked them the purpose of their visit and they said, "We have been asked to call you to Lhasa as there is some probable danger to the Dalai Lama's life." Reting is said to have replied, "I resigned many years ago, so it is strange that they have to consult me." They made no reply. By then the soldiers had already arrived with weapons, and the fourth <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. རུ་དཔོན] A military officer in the traditional Tibetan Army just below a depön (commander). Rupön were usually in charge of half of a regiment (something like a battalion).">rupön</a> Kel<a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. སྲང] A unit of traditional Tibetan currency. It was also called ngüsang [tib. དངུལ་སྲང]. 50 nügsang = 1 dotse; 10 sho = 1 nügsang; 20 5-karma coins = 1 ngüsang. There were also paper currency notes of 7-sang, 25-sang, and 10-sang denominations.">sang</a> went in and took Reting by the hand, asking him to come immediately. Then they suddenly decided to offer food to the Shape, and they were apparently served separately. I heard that Surkhang had then been offered some money. I do not remember how much, but Surkhang is believed not to have taken the money as the Regent was already there (in Lhasa). I do not know if they offered any to Lhalu. I did not talk to him, but Surkhang told my father. He is even supposed to have told him, "If someone had a movie camera, it would have been nice to film the reaction of the faces of the people." When it was time to leave, they asked Reting Rimpoche if he would like to ride the horse called, Yuja La [Tib. གཡུ་བྱ་ལགས], or a red mule called Norzin la or something, but Surkhang recommended the mule. I heard that Surkhang told my late father, "I thought that if Reting rode a horse and fled riding the horse, we would not know what to do. If he rode a mule, it couldn't run fast." So they brought Reting [to Lhasa] riding the mule, taking some soldiers with them and leaving some there. Surkhang and Lhalu talked and said that one of them should stay behind and seal up Reting Labrang, while the other should bring Reting. Then Surkhang told Lhalu, "Since you have been a tsipön, you might not easily get embarrassed. So please stay behind and do the sealing. I would feel embarrassed to do the sealing." Lhalu accepted to stay back and he did the sealing while Surkhang took Reting and left. This is authentic because Lhalu told me this when we were in the jail together. Lhalu took two or three days to seal the property. At that time, Tseyangla was in Reting monastery, and she asked Lhalu to let her take her jewelry with her. Lhalu allowed her to take not only her jewelry but also whatever she needed from the storeroom. He probably slept with her for two or three nights. Lhalu told me later, "This saved my life. Otherwise, probably, Reting's men might have been to told to finish me off since I was the person doing the sealing. It was up to me how much I would give her. If I had been stubborn and didn't give her the ornaments, she might not tell the Reting's men not to do that. Because I gave her the things, she stopped Reting's men for 2-3 days." To avoid this, he had given her things generously and she talked to Reting's men telling them not to do that. At that time, about 20-30 soldiers were left there. However, within a few days, they gave the soldiers <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. 1. ཆང, 2. བྱང] 1. Tibetan locally brewed barley beer. 2. North; nomad areas north of Lhasa in Nagchuga Prefecture 3. ch. 厂 factory.">chang</a> and when the soldiers were drunk, they killed most of them and opened the sealed chambers, pillaged everything and disappearing. Three people ran away from Reting. When the report reached Lhasa, more troops were dispatched under Netö [Tib. སྣེ་སྟོད], the husband of Netö Yudrön's [Tib. གྱུ་སྒྲོན] daughter who was the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. བཤེར་དཔང] The Tibetan government&#x27;s investigatory/prosecutorial/legal office that investigates. 2. The heads/judges of this office.">Sherpang</a> [Tib. བཤེར་དཔང] official. He was dispatched to Reting and was told to go via the mountain-side. However, instead of doing this, he went via the valley, and for this he was later dismissed from government service because he was delayed in reaching Reting. Another interesting event that happened then concerned the lay official Chaluwa [Tib. ཆ་ལུ་བ] who was known as the bearded Chalu, the groom of the Chalu family, and was to be appointed as the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. རྫོང་དཔོན] The head of a dzong in the traditional Tibetan government.">dzongpön</a> of Namru [Tib. གནམ་རུ]. He had received notification from the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. སྣེ་མགྲོན] The monk official in charge of the Regent&#x27;s Secretariat Office (shöga). He was the equivalent of the Lord Chamberlain in the Dalai Lama&#x27;s Secretariat.">nendrön</a> of the Regent's office asking him to attend the office the next day for further orders. He was under the impression that he was to be sent to the fighting at the Reting's monastery, so he pretended to be sick and began to scream and yell until somebody went to the nendrön's house asking for him to be excused. However, somehow the nendrön was informed that he was not really sick, and when they checked and found this was true, he was required to pay a penalty of ten sang of gold, so he not only lost ten sang of gold, but he also lost the promotion that was due to him as the head of Namru Dzong. So all his colleagues used to call him "lost Namru, 10 gold (coins)" (Tib. ནམགྱེ་སེརྗུ [གནམ་བསྐྱལ་གསེར་བཅུ]. At that time, a lot of soldiers were sent to Reting monastery from the Trapchi, ཇདང [Tib. ཇ་དང] and ངདང [Tib. ང་དང] Regiments with two <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. མདའ་དཔོན] A commander or general in charge of a regiment in the traditional Tibetan Army. If a regiment had only 500 troops, there was usually only one depön, but if there were 1,000 troops, there were usually two.">depön</a>, མུཇ and Tsögo. It was very bad. They attacked Reting monastery with heavy guns, firing indiscriminately and they set the juniper trees [around the monastery] on fire. The most important commander-in chief among them was Ketsula [Tib. སྐལ་ཚུལ་ལགས]. <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཞྭ་སྒབ་པ] The name of the family of an important lay official during the 1940s and 1950s.">Shakabpa</a> and Shügüpa were also there. As a result of this, Reting's property was reduced to nothing and was a total loss. One of our servants had to go there to bring back the horses, since at that time it was common to requisition horses and mules from the higher aristocrats if the government had need of them. This was called "borrowed horses, borrowed mules" [Tib. གཡར་རྟ་གཡར་དྲེལ]. He was a very low ranking servant named Gelong, and when he reached the rooms used for keeping imitation jewelry for theatrical performances, he saw a big <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. སྤ་ཕྲུག] The traditional woman&#x27;s headdress.">patrug</a> which he thought contained coral stones. He just picked it up and went back to Lhasa with it where it was later found to be only pieces of glass. At that time, he also took a few bottles of White Horse Brand Whisky because he knew he had seen us using it. He drank it and got drunk. In this way anybody, including the senior officers, looted anything that they could get their hands on. At that time it was said that there was hardly a house in Lhasa that did not have something or other from Reting Labrang's property. There used to be a big gold head ornament called the Mogor [Ch. mao hui], with sixteen or seventeen diamonds which was to used by Reting Labrang. It disappeared and nobody knows where it went. The soldiers also pillaged a lot of things including gold. When the horse sellers in Lhasa heard that the soldiers had gold, they took <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ད་ཡང; ch. 大洋] A Chinese silver dollar that had the image of Yuan Shikai on its face. It was used by the Chinese government in Tibet in the 1950s because Tibetans did not accept Chinese paper currency.">dayan</a> to buy the gold and it was then said that the soldiers didn't know about the tola (the unit for weighing gold), so the weight of the gold was weighed with dayan with the weight of a dayan and gold being treated equally. At that time,it probably might have been 5-6 <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. རྡོ་ཚད] A currency unit in traditional Tibet that was equal to 50 ngüsang.">dotse</a> per tola of gold. In this way, most of Reting's property was stolen and sold very inexpensively, and even I bought some decorative Chinese drawings very inexpensively. That is how Reting Labrang's summer cottage was completely destroyed.   

**Q:**  What happened to the Reting Labrang's <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. བཞི་སྡེ] The monastery/labrang of Reting Rimpoche in Lhasa.">Shide</a> Monastery [Tib. བཞི་སྡེ] in Lhasa?   

**A:**  In Lhasa, Reting Labrang's <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. བཞི་སྡེ] The monastery/labrang of Reting Rimpoche in Lhasa.">Shide</a> was very small, and nothing much happened. As I was in India for the 1947 Asian-African Conference, I do not know much about what happened. When we reached Kalimpong in the second month of the Tibetan calendar, my father and his colleagues had to go to Sikkim in connection with a permit to be issued for the trade of cotton textiles by the Political Officer in Sikkim. At that time, cotton cloth was rare in Tibet and even if you just sold the cloth buying permit, you could get 2000-3000 Rupees. At that time, cloth was brought to Sadam in China.
