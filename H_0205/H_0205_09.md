**Q:**  Tell me about the additional tax called shimbar that was imposed on Tashilhunpo?   

**A:**  Yes, they imposed the Shimbar on Tashilhunpo. This work was done by Lungshar. At that time Lungshar probably hated Tashilhunpo a little bit and he was slightly rude [Tib. 'ar po] to them. I heard that Tashilhunpo was obliged to pay 5,500 khe of grain for the Shimbar tax. Before that, there wasn't any talk about the Shimbar, so they were surprised to have to pay 5,500 khe of grain that year and thought that they wee being taxed a great deal. As far as we [his family] were concerned, in the beginning we had to pay 2,500 khe as the Shimbar tax. So we were also astonished and thought how can we pay that much every year. At that time our older servants were saying that we can not pay that much so we submitted a petition. We had lost 9 aristocrats estates (Tib. gerkhag [sger khag]) that had been under our jurisdiction. So they also submitted a petition saying Sambo is appealing that they cannot pay 2,500 khe for the Shimbar tax so please give us Sambo's property and we will pay a tax of 5,000 khe of grain. Consequently, an Investigation Committee was appointed and Lungshar investigated the case. At that time, my late father might have been young and probably he was slightly impudent [Tib. zhal rgyags pa] toward Lungshar and that caused Lungshar to get angry and he demoted my father from the Theiji position.   

**Q:**  Was he a Theiji at that time?   

**A:**  Yes. We had a land tenure document called Cholo [Tib. cho lo] which indicated we were granted the Theiji rank from generation to generation. Then Lungshar told us, "If you are saying that you can't pay 2,500 khe, the nine aristocrats are telling us to give Sambo's property to them and they will pay 5,000 khe of grain as the Shimbar tax. So you should pay 5,000 khe of grain." So the 9 aristocrats lost the case but we had to pay double the original tax. Then we submitted a petition again to the government. This was the time of the 13th Dalai Lama. We wrote in the petition, "We, are an old family from whom a Dalai Lama has been identified. We have to pay 5,000 khe of Shimbar tax, but we cannot charge more for our lease fees to the people who took our lands as a permanent lease because they had the endorsement [Tib. rgyab snon] of the Dalai Lama's seal [Tib. sbug dam] and the seal of the Kashag and our own seal indicating that we were not allowed to increase the lease fee. So there was no way to increase the lease fee. Therefore, we appealed to the government to take back all of our property and please grant us a basis for making our living [Tib. 'tsho rten] as an old family of the Dalai Lama." The response to this appeal said, "You don't need to adhere to the [old] endorsements and you can levy taxes on newly opened fields [Tib. babshi] like other people. Anyway, you have to pay 5,000 khe of grain." So we had to ask for leave for 6-7 months to levy the taxes on the newly opened fields and create a source of income. Actually, to tell you the truth, we ended up getting more that 5,000 khe [in new income]. We got probably 20,000-30,000 khe. So we could pay 5,000 khe of grain for the Shimbar and still had some left over. Likewise, Tashilhunpo also yelled in anguish at having to pay 5,500 khe of grain. When they went to the fields and organized sources for paying the tax, Tashilhunpo, which was much bigger than us, probably didn't need to complain about paying 5,500 khe. However, when all of a sudden they were told to pay 5,500 khe, they might have been astonished. We also had the same feeling. Similarly, there were also others like Surkhang who were ordered to pay the Shimbar. All of them were obliged to pay that.   

**Q:**  There was a reason for Tashilhunpo to pay the one-fourth military salary [Tib. dmag phogs bzhi zur], but what was the reason for them to pay 5,500 khe? Did you see their documents?   

**A:**  I didn't see their documents. Actually, 5,500 khe was not enough .   

**Q:**  How did you know that they had to pay 5,500 khe?   

**A:**  Kapshö Sawangchemmo [Tib. ka shod sa dbang chen mo] told me this. He said, "Tashilhunpo is complaining [Tib. sdug skad] a lot about having to pay 5,500 khe and your household is paying 5,000 khe. So there is only 500 difference. But, they were claiming like this and the Panchen Lama also had to run away."   

**Q:**  When did Kapshö tell you this?   

**A:**  Probably he told me in 1949 or 1950 or 1951. I don't remember clearly. Anyway, it was at the time of, or just after, Tibet was liberated. The two of us just had a casual talk. When it was said that we couldn't pay 2,500 khe, it seemed that it would be impossible to give 5,000 khe, but when we went to the estates and collected the grain tax from the local places, the miser were also not complaining about it.   

**Q:**  Before the 9 "aristocrats" got out from under you, how many estates did Sambo have?   

**A:**  The estate called Dranang [Tib. gra nang] was the main salary estate for the Dalai Lama's family (Tib. Khyongdeb ['khyongs thebs]). After that, the family appealed that this was not enough for their income so as additional salary estates there got Sangri [Tib. zangs ri], Tranggo [Tib. 'phrang sgo], and Kyishong [Tib. skyid gshongs] In the Tsöna area, there was Deu [Tib. rde'u] Gadag [Tib. ga dag].   

**Q:**  So were there 9 aristocrats [who used to be under Sambo], right?   

**A:**  Yes. They belonged to Dranang. In the Dranang area, there were 306-307 dön [Tib. 'don] of land. In that area, there were also some monasteries like Dingmoche [Tib. lding mo che] and Gyamin Tsokhag [Tib. ?]. Dranang Dzong was in charge of enforcing the law [Tib. khrims 'go khrims gnon]. In Dranang, there were many aristocratic and monastic estates.   

**Q:**  Sambo had 300 dön of land, right?   

**A:**  Yes. It was ridiculous [Tib. khungs lung yod ma red]. I swear by the Three Jewels that the size of the land was probably like the size of the country Bhutan, though we didn't have the name of a king. [Laughter] Among the 9 aristocratic families, three became lay officials of the government: Jede [Tib. lce bde], Dumbuwa [Tib. ldum bu ba], and Gomo Shöntshang [Tib. sgo mo gzhon tshang?] The remaining 6 aristocratic families didn't become lay officials: Baiyuwa [Tib. dpal yul ba], Lama Yangdag [Tib. bla ma yang dag]. I don't remember all of the names. They didn't become lay officials thinking that Sambo might dislike them because they had the old relationship of lord and servants [to Sambo] for many years.   

**Q:**  They got out from under Sambo, right?   

**A:**  Yes. They were made to get out from under Sambo.   

**Q:**  How did the nine of them get out?   

**A:**  At that time, they were talking about the history from the 5th Dalai Lama's time saying they did not belong to Sambo. Probably, they were appealing saying that they used to be [separate] aristocrats during the 5th Dalai Lama's time.   

**Q:**  Did they submit a petition?   

**A:**  Yes. They may or may not have been like this during the 5th Dalai Lama's time. Even if they were supposed to be like that, they had belonged to Sambo from the 5th to the 7th Dalai Lama. Then we became the family of the Dalai Lama (yabshi)at the time of the 7th Dalai Lama. So it seems that they didn't have to talk and cause trouble, but at that time, Lungshar probably supported them a little bit. I heard that that time Lungshar got angry because something happened and he [my late father] was demoted and made us to pay 5,000 khe instead of 2,500 and he lost the nine aristocratic subordinate families. We had a very bad time.   

**Q:**  What was his demotion?   

**A:**  He was demoted from Theiji to Senampa.   

**Q:**  What year was that?   

**A:**  At that time I was a small child.   

**Q:**  Were you already born?   

**A:**  Yes. I was born. Making the Babso [Tib. 'bab bzo] tax was in the Snake Year. Probably, my late father was demoted in the Hare Year.   

**Q:**  That should be the Fire-Hare Year, 1927, right?   

**A:**  Probably.   

**Q:**  Goldstein. Levying taxes on the newly opened fields (Tib. babshi ['bab gzhis]) was in 1921-22.   

**A:**  I mean when they [my family] made the tax income from Dranang, when we couldn't pay the amount that was levied, that was in the Snake Year.   

**Q:**  Probably, it took many years to do that?   

**A:**  Probably. I think there might have been some trouble. When I asked my late brother Tsögo [Tib. mtsho sgo], "How much were you obliged to pay for the babshi?" He just said a small amount like 400-500-600 khe. When I asked him how did that happen? He said, "This was done through a meritorious [Tib. tshogs bsags] woman." When I asked him how she did that? He said, "When she came there she was single and she probably might have served him for 1-2 nights." [sexually] and he might have given her a gift. Since he was a human, he couldn't be very fair.   

**Q:**  Lhalu and those aristocrats also got the babshi tax levied, right?   

**A:**  Yes, Lhalu [Tib. lha klu], Thönpa [Tib. thon pa] and Shatra [Tib. bshad sgra] also got babshi.   

**Q:**  I heard that Lhalu was levied very lightly?   

**A:**  Probably. He might have done that a little bit.   

**Q:**  Please tell me in detail how the Reting problem started?   

**A:**  I do not know all the details, but I shall tell you on the basis of the authentic information I have. Reting was then not only the Regent, but also the senior tutor to the Dalai Lama. He told the Tsondu that he was facing personal problems in his life and he needed to go into retreat. When he insisted on this, the Tsondu is supposed to have asked him, "If you resign what shall we do?" Reting said, "There is nothing to worry about, you can ask Taktra to succeed me." The reason why Reting wanted Taktra to succeed him was that Reting was the senior tutor and Taktra was the Junior Tutor of His Holiness, and also they had taken some teaching on the Jigje [Tib. 'jigs byed] or the Yamantaka from the same lama . I believe they had taken the teaching together from some other lama, and they were therefore dharma friends [Tib. chos grogs] since they may have even done the Jigje retreat together. I think that the main considerations of Reting when he thought of Taktra was that they were dharma friends, and also that he was old, about sixty, so Taktra would only have a few years left to live only. Considering this and the fact that Reting wanted to be away for only three years and Taktra had agreed to accept the Regency for that period of three years only.   

**Q:**  Did such talk of three years really take place?   

**A:**  Yes. it did take place. I am quite sure of it. The year of the Water Horse was during that period of three years, and this decision was sometimes at the end of the Iron-Snake year. Although I was quite young then, there was no suspicion that Reting would resign, but very suddenly it was known that Reting had resigned and that Taktra was the new Regent. After the end of three years, I think it was in the Monkey Year, Reting came back to Lhasa and he probably hinted to Taktra that the three years were over, but there was no sign that Taktra, the old man, would lift up his butt at all.   

**Q:**  When Reting returned to Lhasa was there any conversation between the two that the three year period was over, and what about the resignation, etc.?   

**A:**  I do not know if there was such a talk, but it was said that Reting had publicly hinted that the three years period was over. The incident at Lhundrup Dzong had just taken place and when the Sera Jey monks explained to Reting what had happened, Reting probably openly criticized the decision taken by Taktra, saying it was not at all fair. Taktra however, did not show any intention of resigning so it was inconvenient for Reting to tell him, "Aren't you going to resign?" So Reting Rimpoche had no alternative except to return to Reting Monastery. Taktra also hated and gave quite a lot of trouble to Reting Labrang.   

**Q:**  What was the nature of this trouble?   

**A:**  As far as the decision making body, the Kashag, was concerned, there were four kalön and there were four drunyichemmmo in the Yigtsang. Before that, Reting had appointed some pro-Reting officials to those positions. When some of them died or had been removed, they were replaced by people from the wrong side [pro-Taktra]. None of the new appointments were Reting's friends, and this made Reting very unhappy. And when the Reting Labrang requested some miscellaneous things from Taktra, he acted on them in the opposite way.   

**Q:**  I don't think such things happened. Were there any examples of Taktra doing like this on miscellaneous things?   

**A:**  No, I don't have any particular incident to tell you, but since they [Reting Labrang] thought that the situation was not going to be good, I heard that a man who was quite close to Reting called Gyagpön Bu Tsering Thöndrub [Tib. brgya dpon bu tshe ring don grub] or Thöndrub Gyalpo [Tib. don grub rgyal po], I do not remember his name properly, was sent to China by Reting to contact Chiang Kaishek and request that he send soldiers. If he (Chiang Kaishek) agreed to help Reting get back the regency, then Reting would give China all the land below [east of] Chamdo. This is a bit shocking, but I heard this. Within a few weeks, I think it was in either the Sheep, Monkey, or Bird Year (1944/45), he went via the northern route to Kham and then to China. Chiang Kaishek's government was in Nanjing. That was at the time that Künphel and Abo Raga had been expelled from India to China. It was then that Künphel had quarrels with Reting Rimpoche's representative called Simpönla [Tib. gzim dpon lags] in Kalimpong and he is believed to have said, "If I do not destroy Reting Labrang, do not utter my name again" (Meaning - if I do not destroy Reting Labrang I am not worthy of being called Künphel). Künphel, who was very intelligent, started making investigations and found that Reting's people were trying to bargain [with Chiang Kaishek] to get him the regency back, so he informed the Khendrönlosum officials. The Khenjung [of these three], the one who died a year ago, was Tsadora Thubden Sangpo [Tib. tsha rdo ra thub bstan bzang po], the tsendrön was Thubden Tshenleg [Tib. thub bstan mtshan legs] and the Lotsawa was Thubden Sangye [Tib. thub bstan sangs rgyas]. I am sure they must have verified this and sent a telegram to the Tibetan government. This was a secret telegram whose first line said, "No one is allowed to read the telegram except the Kashag." The translator was the lay official Tara Dopa [Tib. rta ra mdo pa] who was the son of Shölkang [Tib. zhol khang]. When he saw the first line, he thought that it would be better not to know the content of the telegram so he put the telegram inside the code book and handed it over to the Kashag where it was translated. The telegram said, "Reting Labrang had told Chiang Kaishek to help them reinstate Reting as the Regent, and if he got reinstated, then the area below Chamdo would be given to China. If this information were to get leaked, we would be definitely get beheaded. So please do not let this information leak out."   

**Q:**  Since they were not Chinese citizens, why would they get beheaded?   

**A:**  Since there were in China and the Chinese outnumbered them, something might happen to them. This was the information sent to the Kashag by the Khendrönlosum from China. After that information was received in Lhasa, a man came to see the chandzö of Gyambumgang [Tib. rgya 'bum sgang] Drunyichemmo and handed over a parcel which was a petition that had supposedly been sent by the Doji Yuthok. It was addressed to the Regent. When no one came to collect it, the chandzö of Gyambumgang opened it and it exploded. People said that they had seen the damage to the house of the Drunyichemmo Gyambumgang caused by the explosion. Suddenly the government decided to call Reting to Lhasa and two Shape, Surkhang and Lhalu, were sent that same night to Trapchi from where they took some soldiers and went to Reting. They reached Reting early morning at sunrise on the second or third day. When they reached the monastery they asked to see Reting. Reting asked them the purpose of their visit and they said, "We have been asked to call you to Lhasa as there is some probable danger to the Dalai Lama's life." Reting is said to have replied, "I resigned many years ago, so it is strange that they have to consult me." They made no reply. By then the soldiers had already arrived with weapons, and the fourth rupön Kelsang went in and took Reting by the hand, asking him to come immediately. Then they suddenly decided to offer food to the Shape, and they were apparently served separately. I heard that Surkhang had then been offered some money. I do not remember how much, but Surkhang is believed not to have taken the money as the Regent was already there (in Lhasa). I do not know if they offered any to Lhalu. I did not talk to him, but Surkhang told my father. He is even supposed to have told him, "If someone had a movie camera, it would have been nice to film the reaction of the faces of the people." When it was time to leave, they asked Reting Rimpoche if he would like to ride the horse called, Yuja La [Tib. g.yu bya lags], or a red mule called Norzin la or something, but Surkhang recommended the mule. I heard that Surkhang told my late father, "I thought that if Reting rode a horse and fled riding the horse, we would not know what to do. If he rode a mule, it couldn't run fast." So they brought Reting [to Lhasa] riding the mule, taking some soldiers with them and leaving some there. Surkhang and Lhalu talked and said that one of them should stay behind and seal up Reting Labrang, while the other should bring Reting. Then Surkhang told Lhalu, "Since you have been a tsipön, you might not easily get embarrassed. So please stay behind and do the sealing. I would feel embarrassed to do the sealing." Lhalu accepted to stay back and he did the sealing while Surkhang took Reting and left. This is authentic because Lhalu told me this when we were in the jail together. Lhalu took two or three days to seal the property. At that time, Tseyangla was in Reting monastery, and she asked Lhalu to let her take her jewelry with her. Lhalu allowed her to take not only her jewelry but also whatever she needed from the storeroom. He probably slept with her for two or three nights. Lhalu told me later, "This saved my life. Otherwise, probably, Reting's men might have been to told to finish me off since I was the person doing the sealing. It was up to me how much I would give her. If I had been stubborn and didn't give her the ornaments, she might not tell the Reting's men not to do that. Because I gave her the things, she stopped Reting's men for 2-3 days." To avoid this, he had given her things generously and she talked to Reting's men telling them not to do that. At that time, about 20-30 soldiers were left there. However, within a few days, they gave the soldiers chang and when the soldiers were drunk, they killed most of them and opened the sealed chambers, pillaged everything and disappearing. Three people ran away from Reting. When the report reached Lhasa, more troops were dispatched under Netö [Tib. sne stod], the husband of Netö Yudrön's [Tib. gyu sgron] daughter who was the Sherpang [Tib. bsher dpang] official. He was dispatched to Reting and was told to go via the mountain-side. However, instead of doing this, he went via the valley, and for this he was later dismissed from government service because he was delayed in reaching Reting. Another interesting event that happened then concerned the lay official Chaluwa [Tib. cha lu ba] who was known as the bearded Chalu, the groom of the Chalu family, and was to be appointed as the dzongpön of Namru [Tib. gnam ru]. He had received notification from the nendrön of the Regent's office asking him to attend the office the next day for further orders. He was under the impression that he was to be sent to the fighting at the Reting's monastery, so he pretended to be sick and began to scream and yell until somebody went to the nendrön's house asking for him to be excused. However, somehow the nendrön was informed that he was not really sick, and when they checked and found this was true, he was required to pay a penalty of ten sang of gold, so he not only lost ten sang of gold, but he also lost the promotion that was due to him as the head of Namru Dzong. So all his colleagues used to call him "lost Namru, 10 gold (coins)" (Tib. namgye serju [gnam bskyal gser bcu]. At that time, a lot of soldiers were sent to Reting monastery from the Trapchi, Jadang [Tib. ja dang] and Ngadang [Tib. nga dang] Regiments with two depön, Muja and Tsögo. It was very bad. They attacked Reting monastery with heavy guns, firing indiscriminately and they set the juniper trees [around the monastery] on fire. The most important commander-in chief among them was Ketsula [Tib. skal tshul lags]. Shakabpa and Shügüpa were also there. As a result of this, Reting's property was reduced to nothing and was a total loss. One of our servants had to go there to bring back the horses, since at that time it was common to requisition horses and mules from the higher aristocrats if the government had need of them. This was called "borrowed horses, borrowed mules" [Tib. g.yar rta g.yar drel]. He was a very low ranking servant named Gelong, and when he reached the rooms used for keeping imitation jewelry for theatrical performances, he saw a big patrug which he thought contained coral stones. He just picked it up and went back to Lhasa with it where it was later found to be only pieces of glass. At that time, he also took a few bottles of White Horse Brand Whisky because he knew he had seen us using it. He drank it and got drunk. In this way anybody, including the senior officers, looted anything that they could get their hands on. At that time it was said that there was hardly a house in Lhasa that did not have something or other from Reting Labrang's property. There used to be a big gold head ornament called the Mogor [Ch. mao hui], with sixteen or seventeen diamonds which was to used by Reting Labrang. It disappeared and nobody knows where it went. The soldiers also pillaged a lot of things including gold. When the horse sellers in Lhasa heard that the soldiers had gold, they took dayan to buy the gold and it was then said that the soldiers didn't know about the tola (the unit for weighing gold), so the weight of the gold was weighed with dayan with the weight of a dayan and gold being treated equally. At that time,it probably might have been 5-6 dotse per tola of gold. In this way, most of Reting's property was stolen and sold very inexpensively, and even I bought some decorative Chinese drawings very inexpensively. That is how Reting Labrang's summer cottage was completely destroyed.   

**Q:**  What happened to the Reting Labrang's Shide Monastery [Tib. bzhi sde] in Lhasa?   

**A:**  In Lhasa, Reting Labrang's Shide was very small, and nothing much happened. As I was in India for the 1947 Asian-African Conference, I do not know much about what happened. When we reached Kalimpong in the second month of the Tibetan calendar, my father and his colleagues had to go to Sikkim in connection with a permit to be issued for the trade of cotton textiles by the Political Officer in Sikkim. At that time, cotton cloth was rare in Tibet and even if you just sold the cloth buying permit, you could get 2000-3000 Rupees. At that time, cloth was brought to Sadam in China.
