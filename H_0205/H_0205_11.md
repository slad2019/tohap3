### Tape 11  
**A:**  When I became a lay official, I was 17 years old. At that time, I didn't have any kind of special feeling.   

**Q:**  When you became a lay official, who decided this? Was it your father's idea or what?   

**A:**  Yes, my late father told me that now you should become a lay official and he made the plan for that. At that time, we had to submit a khata scarf (shabdö nyendar [Tib. zhabs sdod snyan dar]) to seek admission to become a lay official.   

**Q:**  Where did you have to submit the khata to?   

**A:**  We had to submit it to the Tsikhang.   

**Q:**  Did you have to go in person to submit it?   

**A:**  Yes.   

**Q:**  Was it okay for you to go alone? Or did you have to have an older official take you there?   

**A:**  It was okay to report it through the Secretary of the Tsikhang, the Tsipa.   

**Q:**  Did you have to go to the home of the Tsipa?   

**A:**  The Tsipa was in the Tsikhang and I could go there and submit the khata for admission and tell him, "Please report that I am seeking permission to become a lay official at the Gyetor Festival on the 8th of the 3rd month.   

**Q:**  You had to tell them at which festival you wanted to become a lay official, right?   

**A:**  Yes.   

**Q:**  How many festivals were there where you could become a lay official?   

**A:**  There was the New Year, the Gyetor and on the 25th of the 10th month (the Death Anniversary of Tsongkapa) [Tib. ngamjö].   

**Q:**  When the Dalai Lama was invited to the prayer assembly at the Mönlam Festival (Tib. Tshogpheb [tshogs phebs]), there was an additional lay official, right?   

**A:**  Yes. After we submitted the khata through the Tsipa, if the tsipön approved it, the Tsipa would inform us that it was approved.   

**Q:**  Normally, would they approve it right way?   

**A:**  The Tsipa would report it in 2-3 days and then we would have to wait for the approval. The Tsipa wouldn't report it when the tsipön were busy. He would report it when they were not that busy. After the tsipön approved it, the Tsipa would inform us saying, "It is approved, so you should submit the khata seeking permission to become a lay official to the Kashag." So we also had to submit a khata seeking permission to the Kashag.   

**Q:**  Did you have to go in person to the Kashag to submit it?   

**A:**  Yes. As far as the monk officials were concerned, this khata was regarded as very important, but we, the lay officials, didn't have that. But we had to submit a kind of antique khata called ashe [Tib. a she] to the Kashag and we should submit an antique khata called nangdzö to the Dalai Lama.   

**Q:**  The nangdzö was for the Dalai Lama, right?   

**A:**  It was supposed to be for the Dalai Lama, but we didn't know what they actually did with it. Anyway, we had to get that prepared and we had to submit it through the Tsipa.   

**Q:**  They didn't approve it right away, right?   

**A:**  It would be approved after 1-2 days. It was quick.   

**Q:**  When you first went to the Tsikhang to report, did you go with your father or with the servants?   

**A:**  I was already there as a trainee for becoming a lay official [Tib. Tsitrugpa] in the Tsikhang, which also was the lay official training center.   

**Q:**  What do tsitrugpa do?   

**A:**  It was supposed be to learn how to do arithmetic [Tib. rtsis]. At the beginning, when we became Tsitrugpa, we had to report and seek the permission to become a tsitrugpa to the Tsikhang through the Tsipa.   

**Q:**  When did you become a Tsitrugpa?   

**A:**  I became a Tsitrugpa 1-2 years before I became a lay official.   

**Q:**  You became a Tsitrugpa when you were about 15 years old, right?   

**A:**  Yes, something like that.   

**Q:**  When you wanted to become a Tsitrugpa, did you have to go to the Tsikhang in person?   

**A:**  No, they sent a servant with a khata.   

**Q:**  What kind of khata was that?   

**A:**  Probably, it was a Ashe Khata, I don't know for sure.   

**Q:**  Usually, would they say it is okay right away?   

**A:**  Yes they would, because we were hereditary lay officials and there wouldn't be any obstruction. When I became a Tsitrugpa, I had to wear a pen case [Tib. smyug sgrog] with an auspicious knot sign [Tib. dpal be] and a maroon [Tib. rgya dmar] color brocade uniform. I had to prepare a round cushion for myself to be used in the Tsikhang. There was a difference in the cushions. The tsitrugpa who were going to become senampa would use a cushion made from woolen material [Tib. snam bu] with dots on it (Tib. thigma [thig ma]), but the Tsitrugpa who were going to become ordinary lay officials probably didn't need to have their cushion made from thigma. Their cushion was made from white woolen material.   

**Q:**  What color was your cushion as a senampa?   

**A:**  It was white with blue and red dots on it. Two and three days before joining the Tsikhang, we would have to prepare some butter lamps and the offering of wheat and tsamba mixed with butter [Tib. droso chemar] in the Tsikhang. As for the tsamba for this offering, the sweepers would compress it when they put the tsamba in the measuring box (Tib. bo ['bo]) and make the tsamba very high.   

**Q:**  Would they take the tsamba in leather pouches?   

**A:**  No. They would bring the bo and put the tsamba in it at home. I heard that they would put about 5 khe of tsamba in it. I was wondering how could they compress so much tsamba into one bo. It would become so high that I used to worry the tsamba might fall down on the way when they carried it to the Tsikhang. They would also stick pieces of butter on it.   

**Q:**  Did they have only one bo?   

**A:**  No. They had two. One was for the wheat and the other was for the tsamba mixed with butter. Probably the sweepers would take these materials from our home and make the wooden slab with butter decorations to be put on the Droso Chemar (Tib. tsedro [rtse sgro]). Then the sweepers would take my cushion to the Tsikhang.   

**Q:**  Didn't you have to take any test?   

**A:**  Yes, I had to. In the early morning of the day when I had to take the test, a kind of ceremony would take place at home. At the celebration, all of the family members would sit in line.   

**Q:**  Would they offer you khata?   

**A:**  I would stand up and offer a khata to the shrine and to my late father. At that time, I didn't have my mother.   

**Q:**  If she was there, you had to offer her a khata, right?   

**A:**  Probably yes.   

**Q:**  At that time, hadn't your father got remarried?   

**A:**  Yes, I was just a child.   

**Q:**  Didn't you have your stepmother then?   

**A:**  Yes.   

**Q:**  Didn't you have to offer a khata to your stepmother?   

**A:**  Probably I did. I don't remember clearly. And the smaller children like [my younger brother] Jigme la [Tib. 'jigs med lags] gave me khata followed by the manager, the stewards and all the people above the sweepers who received salary from family.   

**Q:**  Didn't the smaller children have to offer a khata to your father?   

**A:**  No. Then they probably displayed some gold bricks and silver bricks and some other things as the gift from our family and they would write them in the list of the gifts, the bültho [Tib. 'bul tho].   

**Q:**  Would they hand the bültho over to you?   

**A:**  No, they wouldn't. They were just making notes in a list when people came from outside to celebrate and offer gifts. The gifts were supposed to be for me, but I myself didn't get any thing to use. They would collect them. After they gave the gifts, it was still early and the sun hadn't rise. Then we went to the Jokhang for pilgrimage.   

**Q:**  Right after the pilgrimage, you went to the Tsikhang, right?   

**A:**  Yes, it was a bit early, and we had to wait in the work hostel of the Chief Caretaker of chapels (Tib. gönyerpön [dkon mnyer dpon]) of the Jokhang for a short time. Then the Tsikhang was open and I went in and the tsipön had already arrived. Usually, it was not the time for the Tsikhang to open, so probably they might have come earlier.   

**Q:**  Is the Tsikhang located in the Jokhang?   

**A:**  Yes. The Tsikhang is located on the top floor of the back door of the Jokhang, the Sera Tago [Tib. se ra ltag sgo]). When I first entered the door of the Tsikhang, I was told to step in with my right or left leg, but I forget which. I was brought into the Tsikhang and I had to offer a khata to the main statue in the Tsikhang.   

**Q:**  What statue was that?   

**A:**  I don't remember. Then I had to take off my hat and salute to the tsipön and offer khatas.   

**Q:**  What kind of hat were you wearing?   

**A:**  I was wearing the yellow hat (Tib. bogdo ['bog tho]).   

**Q:**  At that time, the chandzö and some others were with you, right?   

**A:**  Yes. And my brother Tsögo was also with me, and the chandzö were also there.   

**Q:**  Did your father come with you?   

**A:**  No, he didn't.   

**Q:**  What was your father's position then?   

**A:**  He was a third rank theiji [Tib. thai ji]. Then I sat on the round cushion. Before that, I had to practice for the test of the tradition Tibetan arithmetic calculation. I didn't have any problem with the test because we prepared the test sheet (Tib. deltra [rdel khra]). I had to practice a kind of melody when doing the arithmetic calculations. It was kind of the calculation where I would chant loudly the numbers that I was calculating using a special kind of tune called delke [Tib. rdel skad].   

**Q:**  How would you chant the delke?   

**A:**  They [Tsipa] would read the test sheet. On the test sheet they would write some auspicious words like, "From the Samdru Yangtze [Tib. bsam grub yangs rtse] Estate the yield of 565 khe was received and from others such and such an amount was received, so what was the total amount?" I would have to calculate it while chanting it with a tune and say that this was the total.   

**Q:**  Would you chant the delke now?   

**A:**  I forgot the delke. If the Tsipa reads the test sheet and says, put 13,565 [Tib. 13,565 btang lags] then I would say, "I am going to put 13,565 and first I am going to put 10,000 [Tib. chig khri sum stong lnga bgya drug cu re nga rang la yin chig khri thams pa yin na song] and I would put a piece of broken porcelain as 10,000. Then I would put 3 pieces of stone called phüldo [Tib. 'phul rdo] and say this is for 3,000 [Tib. sum stong thams pa rang la yin sum stong thams pa yin na song la]. Then I would put 3 beans and then 2 beans for 500 and chant the same and 3 pieces of twigs for ten [Tib. bcu shing] and 5 pebbles for 5 and chant in the same way. Since the test sheet was prepared by myself, it was alright.  The writing test was also already written and I had it in my pouch. However, I had to go through the motions of writing one line in front of the tsipön and then hand over the writing that I had prepared beforehand. The tsipön would look at the handwriting and they would write the label [Tib. kha yig] on it; "The handwriting test of Sambo Sey Tendzin Thöndrub." [Tib. bsam pho sras bstan 'dzin thon grub kyi yig tshad spyan zhu]. Probably, they would have to submit it to the Kashag.   

**Q:**  The handwriting test was written by yourself, right?   

**A:**  Yes, but I heard that when some of the Tsitrugpa's handwriting is not good, they would bring handwriting from home [written by someone else] and just go through the motions of writing one or two lines and put it in the pouch and hand over the one which was already written. But I didn't need to do that because I could write a kind of mediocre [Tib. thabs chag] handwriting. When I was showing my writing test, the sweepers had put my cushion where I should sit normally and then I sat there for a while. On that day, I had to offer droma dresi and tea to all the members of Tsikhang. Then I bent down my head and asked for leave for the day and the tsipön showed an appearance of granting the leave and then I went home.   

**Q:**  Did you have to take off your hat to salute?   

**A:**  Yes. After that I was seated on a throne at home and the relatives came to offer khata for the celebration. Since that time I had to go to Tsikhang every day at around 9:30-10 a.m and do the traditional Tibetan calculation, diutang [Tib. rde'u btang].   

**Q:**  Did the Tsipön make you to do the arithmetic calculation?   

**A:**  No. Usually, the Tsipön would make us copy documents. When the Tsipa called us, they would make us do the calculation and they would make corrections if we calculated wrongly. If it was okay, they would say it was right. They would leave us like this for a couple of days. After 1-2 months, they would make us do all the arithmetic calculations like barley, butter and many items and sometimes and I had to display those things all around me. When the calculation was not right, they would make us calculate again and again and make the corrections. When there was no work, the Tsipa would give us exams on the arithmetic difference in size between dre [Tib. bre khyad] and phü ['phul khyad] and teach us if we didn't know. I probably stayed in the Tsikhang for a year. I became a lay official on the 8th of the 3rd month, the Gyetor [Tib. bryad gtor] Festival. [interview repeats talking about submitting the khata for becoming a lay official"]   

**Q:**  If there was a Regent, did you have to submit a khata for seeking permission to the Regent also?   

**A:**  Yes. If there was a Regent present, I also had to submit the khata to the Regent as well as the Kashag. Anyway, it was not so strict for us lay officials in comparison to the monk officials when they submitted a khata to seek the permission to become an official.   

**Q:**  What did they say concerning the monk officials?   

**A:**  I heard they would probably say that the design of the khata was not right and it was too old and dirty and so on. As for the test for the arithmetic calculation to become a lay official, we had to practice very carefully because we didn't know what kind of test sheet they were going to read. The Tsipön would discuss and chose it from among 5-6-7-8 different test sheets. This was very troublesome. If we couldn't pass the test, we would be very embarrassed because there were many lay officials coming to watch and listen to the test.   

**Q:**  You had to take the test in front of the Tsipön, right?   

**A:**  Yes. The Tsipa would sit here and I had to sit here.   

**Q:**  There were about 4 Tsipa, right?   

**A:**  There were 3 of them.   

**Q:**  Would all of them give the test?   

**A:**  No. One of them would give the test and he would read whatever test sheet the Tsipön had chosen. If the tsitrugpa was not that good in doing calculations, he would have a hard time and he would be dripping with sweat. [laughter]. This was the real test on the arithmetic calculation and there wasn't any chance to do something tricky. At the Gyetor Festival, there were two lay officials. My partner was Nangkar [Tib. snang dkar]. He was also called Jangra [Tib. lcang ra]. I took the test at first because I was the senampa and my test was okay. When Nangkar took the test, he had some extra number when he did the calculation, but he didn't count them and just pulled them down and said that the number was balanced and correct. The Tsipa didn't check in detail and he didn't tell him that he had extra numbers, so he was able to get through it. After that, they reported to the Kashag and after the Kashag had approved, the Shöl gaa would send a notice and call us to the Shöl gaa after two days. Then we had to go there with two servants. In the Shöl gaa, the Nendrön would pass down the order approving me as a lay official. He said, "You are approved to become a lay officials on the Gyetor festival and you are granted the junior fourth rank, senampa." [Tib. khyod rang brgyad gtor thog zhabs sdod zhu 'thus dang mi drag sras rnam pa'i gdan thob bstsal ba yin]. The next step was to get the hair knot [Tib. pajok]. This also should be done through checking for an auspicious day. I had my hair knot in the morning of the Gyetor because it was an auspicious day. About 2-3 days before the auspicious day, they would have the hair knot. On that day, I got up at dawn and got the hair knot. At that time, I felt kind of relieved when all my hair was tied on the top of my head because the weather was quite hot then. I also felt slightly uneasy when I first had the hair knot with the golden pendant on my head.  After that, the family ceremony was held and my late father told them to make a separate throne for me. At that time, my father made brand new mattresses with red felt carpets and brocade cushions [Tib. gos kha] and a canopy that was decorated with silk and brocade [Tib. bla bre] for my throne. He said, "Today, I am not going to use old things. I am using all brand new things for the celebration."   

**Q:**  The ordinary lay officials didn't have that, right?   

**A:**  Probably only the senampa and above had that. Actually, I think it is not certain because people wouldn't say anything about what you were doing at home.   

**Q:**  Then you had to be seated in a line, right?   

**A:**  Yes.   

**Q:**  Your stepmother was also seated, right?   

**A:**  Yes. She had a slightly lower cushion. Probably my cushion was higher. I was not that attentive. At first, I offered a khata to the main statue in the shrine and then I offered a khata to my late father and to my stepmother.   

**Q:**  Then the younger children offered the khata, right?   

**A:**  Yes, and the chandzö and stewards and all the servants gave me khata.   

**Q:**  Your family also had to offer you khata, right?   

**A:**  Yes, the chandzö gave me a khata on behalf of the family and they also displayed some loads of rice and butter packed in leather bags as a ceremonial gift [Tib. ltang tshan]. I forgot to tell you something. After I had the hair knot, a hired person born in an auspicious year [Tib. lo bzang] and chosen according to astrological calculations would dress me for the first time. At first, they would make me wear a white shirt. Then they dressed me with pants and the chupa. On that day, I had to wear the official ceremonial dress called gyaluche [Tib. rgya lu chas].
