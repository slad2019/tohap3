## Abstract  

 Sambo [Tib. བསམ་ཕོ] was an important aristocratic official in the Tibetan government who was the Co-Commander of the Trapchi Regiment in 1959. His father was a kalön at that time. In this interview, he talks about how his family reorganized their human lease miser and estate miser in order to be able to generate the additional income from his estates that were needed to pay Lungshar's new Babshi tax. He also talks about how Taktra's regency declined after 1943, and about the favorites of Reting such as Cogtre and Phünkang were suppressed.

**Q:**  Concerning the Babshi Tax assessed on your family, how did you actually pay this?   

**A:**  We had a new, additional tax of 2,500 <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཁལ] A traditional volume measurement used for measuring grain in traditional Tibetan society. Sizes of this unit varied somewhat, but the official government khe (called mkhar ru or bstan dzin mkha ru) weighed about 28-31 pounds for barley. It was used to convey the size of fields. For example, a field said to be 10 khe in size meant that 10 khe of seed could be sown on that field.">khe</a> of grain imposed as the Babshi. This tax was imposed all over the place, not only on us. At that time, they didn't make any change in the [land] basis for paying the taxes, but they just imposed 2,500 khe as an extra tax. Therefore we said that we didn't have the means to pay that tax, and if we had to pay that amount, we, an old family of a [past] Dalai Lama, would be unable to manage. So we submitted a petition and requested that the government either give us a source for our livelihood [Tib. འཚོ་རྟེན] [e.g., land] or please take back our estates and lands. The investigator was Lungshar. [Notes: we skipped the story of losing the 9 estates that was told on a previous tape] At that time my father was quite young and he discussed this matter with our <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཕྱག་མཛོད] A senior manager/treasurer of an aristocratic or monastic estate, or the senior manager/treasurer of an aristocratic family or a monastic unit. Generally chandzö handled both internal and external issues and were considered higher in power and status than nyerpa (stewards), who typically only handled the storerooms.">chandzö</a> and found that many of our estates were leased out. However, the lessees had documents specifying the amount of the lease fees that had been fixed in early times so we couldn't make any changes [to get more revenue]. Therefore, we submitted another petition saying that we had a tax of 5,000 khe imposed, but we didn't have any way to obtain the taxes from the lands that we had leased to other people because they had land tenure documents issued by our [family in] previous generations as well as by the government. This petition was approved and we were told, "You don't need to adhere to the documents [lit. seals] issued by the government and your family in the past. Instead you have to assess a lease fee that will be agreeable by both sides [Tib. གཉིས་ལོའི་འབབ་བཟོ]." So they went to the site of the leased land and together with the person who was occupying the land, they tried to fix a sum that was acceptable to both, the lessor and the lesee who was in occupation of the land and his family. After doing this, we were able to offer 5,000 khe to the government.   

**Q:**  I do not understand. Did they go to the land and say that to the people that they were paying only a small amount, or something like that?   

**A:**  Yes. They would go to the land. Supposing it was a small farm and the tenant had been paying something like ten cents. Then they would revalue it and ask for say thirty cents. If the tenant could not pay, then they would take away the land and give it to somebody else who was willing to pay the new rate.   

**Q:**  Okay, these lands were leased, right?   

**A:**  Yes. They would measure the land and say that this land can yield so much grain so the revenue due should be set accordingly by the landlord and his family, otherwise if the tenant could not pay, they would look for a new tenant.   

**Q:**  What about the land of the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཁྲལ་པ] The class of bound peasant/miser/serf households who held farmland and had to fulfill large corvée tax obligations to their manorial estates/lords. They are often called taxpayer households in English. While some of these were well off by local standards, many were poor due to a variety of factors such as heavy debts and a dearth of able-bodied workers in their households.">treba</a>? And the land that people were leasing -- people who were paying money every year usually as work or by some small amount of grain? But what of people who did the corvee taxes, were their taxes raised also?   

**A:**  When we reassessed the land, it was done in a lenient manner [Tib. དཔྱ་ཡང་པོ]. For the lease fee they would calculate [yields] at the seven times the seed sown. That is, for every <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཁལ] A traditional volume measurement used for measuring grain in traditional Tibetan society. Sizes of this unit varied somewhat, but the official government khe (called mkhar ru or bstan dzin mkha ru) weighed about 28-31 pounds for barley. It was used to convey the size of fields. For example, a field said to be 10 khe in size meant that 10 khe of seed could be sown on that field.">khe</a> of land they would assess the yield as seven times the seed sown. This would be divided into two halves--half for the owner of the land and the other half for the tenant [Tib. བདུན་སྐོར་ཕྱེད་ཤས].   

**Q:**  When you did the seven times the seed rule, who provided the seed?   

**A:**  The person who was working on the land had to arrange for the seed.   

**Q:**  What about the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཁྲལ་པ] The class of bound peasant/miser/serf households who held farmland and had to fulfill large corvée tax obligations to their manorial estates/lords. They are often called taxpayer households in English. While some of these were well off by local standards, many were poor due to a variety of factors such as heavy debts and a dearth of able-bodied workers in their households.">treba</a>?   

**A:**  When they did the seven times calculation, six people were given to each <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. རྐང] The basic land measurement unit for tax obligations in the traditional Tibetan society. One gang was considered a full tax unit of land. A gang was measured by volume, specifically by the amount of seed (sönkhe) that could be sown. This amount was not standardized and the size of one gang varied under different lords.">gang</a> from those who were paying <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. མི་བོགས] A status wherein a peasant &quot;leased&quot; his/her &quot;freedom&quot; from his/her lord to live and work where he/she wanted. The peasants with human lease status still belonged to their lord and were required to pay an annual fee (&quot;human lease fee&quot;) to their lord. The children of human lease peasants inherited this status from parents of the same sex (i.e. sons of a male belonged to their father&#x27;s lord).">mibo</a> and who didn't have work or they didn't have a place to work. Since I didn't work on that, I am not sure how they worked out the horse corvée and the pack animal corvée. Supposing when they had to collect 5 <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. རྡོ་ཚད] A currency unit in traditional Tibet that was equal to 50 ngüsang.">dotse</a> as a tax, each gang had to pay about 15-16 sang.   

**Q:**  Was that when they raised the lease fee?   

**A:**  Yes, that was when they raised it.   

**Q:**  And what was the reason for giving 6 people to each <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. རྐང] The basic land measurement unit for tax obligations in the traditional Tibetan society. One gang was considered a full tax unit of land. A gang was measured by volume, specifically by the amount of seed (sönkhe) that could be sown. This amount was not standardized and the size of one gang varied under different lords.">gang</a>?   

**A:**  The people said that since the proposed implementation of the rule of seven times the amount of seed sown, this had increased what they owed by 50% so they would not find any people to work as laborers for every <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. རྐང] The basic land measurement unit for tax obligations in the traditional Tibetan society. One gang was considered a full tax unit of land. A gang was measured by volume, specifically by the amount of seed (sönkhe) that could be sown. This amount was not standardized and the size of one gang varied under different lords.">gang</a> and requested people to work for them. So we gave each gang 6 people from among our [subjects] who paid mibo.   

**Q:**  I see, were those people given to them during their lifetime?   

**A:**  It was supposed to be for life, but if they did not get along well, they could run away.   

**Q:**  When the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. མི་བོགས] A status wherein a peasant &quot;leased&quot; his/her &quot;freedom&quot; from his/her lord to live and work where he/she wanted. The peasants with human lease status still belonged to their lord and were required to pay an annual fee (&quot;human lease fee&quot;) to their lord. The children of human lease peasants inherited this status from parents of the same sex (i.e. sons of a male belonged to their father&#x27;s lord).">mibo</a> people went there, how did they get their food?   

**A:**  They had to give them their food and clothing and make them work.   

**Q:**  So they basically became like servants?   

**A:**  They had to feed, clothe, and provide for their livelihood.   

**Q:**  Didn't they get paid?   

**A:**  Anyway, they had to provide everything for their livelihood like food and clothing.   

**Q:**  How many extra people were involved?   

**A:**  Four or five thousand definitely. There were a lot of them left, because every year there were newborns. There might be some parents who had 15-20 children.   

**Q:**  If I understand this right, if one person had a kid, was the kid also supposed to work?   

**A:**  When the child became thirteen years old, automatically, the parents would think that people may say something and they would request [to us] to pay the mibo.   

**Q:**  What if they didn't request to pay the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. མི་བོགས] A status wherein a peasant &quot;leased&quot; his/her &quot;freedom&quot; from his/her lord to live and work where he/she wanted. The peasants with human lease status still belonged to their lord and were required to pay an annual fee (&quot;human lease fee&quot;) to their lord. The children of human lease peasants inherited this status from parents of the same sex (i.e. sons of a male belonged to their father&#x27;s lord).">mibo</a>?   

**A:**  Otherwise some other people would try to use them and send them hither and thither.   

**Q:**  So, if they requested to pay the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. མི་བོགས] A status wherein a peasant &quot;leased&quot; his/her &quot;freedom&quot; from his/her lord to live and work where he/she wanted. The peasants with human lease status still belonged to their lord and were required to pay an annual fee (&quot;human lease fee&quot;) to their lord. The children of human lease peasants inherited this status from parents of the same sex (i.e. sons of a male belonged to their father&#x27;s lord).">mibo</a>, they could get through it, right   

**A:**  Yes.   

**Q:**  What happened in the case of these people, if his wife was from some other <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. དཔོན་པོ, མངའ་བདག] 1. A manorial estate holder. 2. Chief of an area.">lord</a> [Tib. དཔོན་ཁུངས]? Did she have to work?   

**A:**  The wife had to work where she belonged and the husband where he belonged, but their families were there, and wherever they were called to work, they had to go there, but otherwise they worked on their respective plots. However, if there was some problem they would do "people exchange"--the husband would go to the wife's <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. དཔོན་པོ, མངའ་བདག] 1. A manorial estate holder. 2. Chief of an area.">lord</a> or the wife would go to the husband's lord, and then they exchange a person [to even it out].   

**Q:**  So that was that, but still was anything done with the lease? According to what you said, it seems everybody was paying the lease fee. Were there any separate <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཁྲལ་པ] The class of bound peasant/miser/serf households who held farmland and had to fulfill large corvée tax obligations to their manorial estates/lords. They are often called taxpayer households in English. While some of these were well off by local standards, many were poor due to a variety of factors such as heavy debts and a dearth of able-bodied workers in their households.">treba</a> other than those who were paying the lease fees?   

**A:**  The <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཁྲལ་པ] The class of bound peasant/miser/serf households who held farmland and had to fulfill large corvée tax obligations to their manorial estates/lords. They are often called taxpayer households in English. While some of these were well off by local standards, many were poor due to a variety of factors such as heavy debts and a dearth of able-bodied workers in their households.">treba</a> were also obliged to pay the lease fee in the same way.   

**Q:**  Actually, under your household, is it correct that you had two different groups of people: the lease fee payers and the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཁྲལ་པ] The class of bound peasant/miser/serf households who held farmland and had to fulfill large corvée tax obligations to their manorial estates/lords. They are often called taxpayer households in English. While some of these were well off by local standards, many were poor due to a variety of factors such as heavy debts and a dearth of able-bodied workers in their households.">treba</a>?   

**A:**  That was the system. However, the extra benefit for the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཁྲལ་པ] The class of bound peasant/miser/serf households who held farmland and had to fulfill large corvée tax obligations to their manorial estates/lords. They are often called taxpayer households in English. While some of these were well off by local standards, many were poor due to a variety of factors such as heavy debts and a dearth of able-bodied workers in their households.">treba</a> was that they had a house for doing the taxes (Tib. ཏྲེཁང [ཁྲལ་ཁང]).   

**Q:**  Did they pay the same fee of half of the boma yield?   

**A:**  Yes.   

**Q:**  How did they work for the taxes?   

**A:**  They had to work for taxes according to the amount of the taxes they were obliged to work based on the land they held, and they also had to pay half the amount of the lease yield fee because they had the land.   

**Q:**  Who was managing your estates at that time?   

**A:**  For example, the estate manager [Tib. ཤིདü] was called Tranang [Tib. གྲ་ནང].   

**Q:**  But he couldn't go to all the estates himself, right?   

**A:**  Yes. There were two shidü who were the main ones in charge, and under them there were many estates. Probably there were 15-20 estates, and each estate had a shidü who would manage the estate.   

**Q:**  At that time you just leased those estates, right?   

**Q:**  Yes, otherwise it was too many for us to manage by ourselves.   

**Q:**  You said that for each <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. རྐང] The basic land measurement unit for tax obligations in the traditional Tibetan society. One gang was considered a full tax unit of land. A gang was measured by volume, specifically by the amount of seed (sönkhe) that could be sown. This amount was not standardized and the size of one gang varied under different lords.">gang</a> 6 people were given [to work] after you assessed the land. Who was working on the fields before that?   

**A:**  I am not sure about this. Probably each estate had their own <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. མི་སེར] A term that can mean serf/bound subject as well as citizen, depending on context. For example, the miser of a lord would connote the bound subjects of that lord, whereas the miser of Tibet would connote citizens of Tibet.">miser</a> and probably they also might have small householders [düjung] working for the estate.   

**Q:**  There were two kinds of people, those who had a basis for working as a tax (Tib. ཏྲེདེན [ཁྲལ་རྟེན]) and those who didn't have <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཁྲལ་རྟེན] The fields that a family holds that are the basis of the tax obligations they must fulfill.">treden</a> and were paying the lease fee, right?   

**A:**  Yes, the people who had the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཁྲལ་རྟེན] The fields that a family holds that are the basis of the tax obligations they must fulfill.">treden</a> were one separate group.   

**Q:**  What did they have to do?   

**A:**  In general, before that, the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཁྲལ་པ] The class of bound peasant/miser/serf households who held farmland and had to fulfill large corvée tax obligations to their manorial estates/lords. They are often called taxpayer households in English. While some of these were well off by local standards, many were poor due to a variety of factors such as heavy debts and a dearth of able-bodied workers in their households.">treba</a> just paid about 5-6 <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཞོ] A unit in the traditional Tibetan currency system. 10 sho equaled to 1 sang and 10 karma equaled one sho.">sho</a>, but later they were also paying the fee of half of the seven times the seed sown. There was also a separate kind of private land on which everybody had to work for about five or six days in a year. That land was called changdeb [Tib. ཕྱག་འདེབས]. Everybody had to help farm that.   

**Q:**  Would that include all the people who were paying lease fee or just the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཁྲལ་པ] The class of bound peasant/miser/serf households who held farmland and had to fulfill large corvée tax obligations to their manorial estates/lords. They are often called taxpayer households in English. While some of these were well off by local standards, many were poor due to a variety of factors such as heavy debts and a dearth of able-bodied workers in their households.">treba</a> working on the changdeb?   

**A:**  I think that everybody living in that area had to come for about ten to fifteen days to work on the changdeb.   

**Q:**  Did the people who were paying lease fees have to be your <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. མི་སེར] A term that can mean serf/bound subject as well as citizen, depending on context. For example, the miser of a lord would connote the bound subjects of that lord, whereas the miser of Tibet would connote citizens of Tibet.">miser</a>, or was the land leased indiscriminately [to anyone]?   

**A:**  Mostly, it was [leased] within our <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. མི་སེར] A term that can mean serf/bound subject as well as citizen, depending on context. For example, the miser of a lord would connote the bound subjects of that lord, whereas the miser of Tibet would connote citizens of Tibet.">miser</a>, for if it was leased outside, there might be an objection saying that the income would go out but we had to do the work. So they would keep it inside our own miser. Most of them had been giving half of the set seven times yield to the owner and half to the worker. But in non-farmed areas where there were mountains and rocks, they would have been given outside.   

**Q:**  What about the other kinds of taxes people paid? They had to send soldiers sometimes with meat tax, or butter or other kinds of things? Did they eliminate all of them or did people have to still pay them?   

**A:**  Whatever taxes on each <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. རྐང] The basic land measurement unit for tax obligations in the traditional Tibetan society. One gang was considered a full tax unit of land. A gang was measured by volume, specifically by the amount of seed (sönkhe) that could be sown. This amount was not standardized and the size of one gang varied under different lords.">gang</a> that were payable earlier were maintained. This was an additional tax.   

**Q:**  It was divided to all of them right?   

**A:**  Yes.   

**Q:**  Sending soldiers was also done according to the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. རྐང] The basic land measurement unit for tax obligations in the traditional Tibetan society. One gang was considered a full tax unit of land. A gang was measured by volume, specifically by the amount of seed (sönkhe) that could be sown. This amount was not standardized and the size of one gang varied under different lords.">gang</a>, right?   

**A:**  Yes. Whoever had the land looked after this. Our family had done this, but the other <a href="#" data-tooltip="[sger pa] 1. Aristocrats, aristocratic families. 2. Private students in the government&#x27;s Tse labdra monk official training school.">gerpa</a> and the monastic estates were not like this.   

**Q:**  I understand.   

**A:**  The <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. བསམ་ཕོ] The abbreviated name of one of the largest and most powerful aristocratic families (Samdru Phodrang).">Sambo</a> family did this, but maybe some other families did not collect revenue from the land as the Sambo family did. They just paid a little bit and left it, but many did not make any revenue. For example, Thönpa's [Tib. ཐོན་པ] <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཕྱག་མཛོད] A senior manager/treasurer of an aristocratic or monastic estate, or the senior manager/treasurer of an aristocratic family or a monastic unit. Generally chandzö handled both internal and external issues and were considered higher in power and status than nyerpa (stewards), who typically only handled the storerooms.">chandzö</a> was with me in jail and when he spoke about this, he told me that they [the government] did not collect much from Thönpa for <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ལུང་ཤར] The family name of a famous aristocratic lay official during the time of the 13th Dalai Lama and the Regent Reting.">Lungshar</a>'s Babshi tax. Probably they were required to pay about 200-300 <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཁལ] A traditional volume measurement used for measuring grain in traditional Tibetan society. Sizes of this unit varied somewhat, but the official government khe (called mkhar ru or bstan dzin mkha ru) weighed about 28-31 pounds for barley. It was used to convey the size of fields. For example, a field said to be 10 khe in size meant that 10 khe of seed could be sown on that field.">khe</a>, but they only paid a small amount and the rest were shown as due, but nobody ever bothered to collect them so it went on like this. It was just shown as due from the Thönpa family.   

**Q:**  I heard that the one of the first <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. སྐུ་དྲག] 1. A member of the lay aristocracy. 2. Title for government lay and monk officials. 3. A name occasionally used for the top leaders/officials in a monastery.">kudrak</a> families to whom <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ལུང་ཤར] The family name of a famous aristocratic lay official during the time of the 13th Dalai Lama and the Regent Reting.">Lungshar</a> levied a big Babshi tax Lhalu, is that right?   

**A:**  I heard from Thönpa Chandzö that even Lhalu and <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. བཤད་སྒྲ] The name of the family of an important lay aristocratic official.">Shatra</a> [Tib. བཤད་སྒྲ] paid only half of the taxes, and left the rest of it as due. It was due every year, but nobody really ever asked for it.   

**Q:**  Did all this happen at the same time that they levied the Babshi on <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. བཀྲ་སིས་ལྷུན་པོ] The famous Gelugpa Monastery of the Panchen Lama located in Shigatse.">Tashilhunpo</a>?   

**A:**  It was done all at once. <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. བཀྲ་སིས་ལྷུན་པོ] The famous Gelugpa Monastery of the Panchen Lama located in Shigatse.">Tashilhunpo</a> was saying that its extra tax was for five thousand five hundred [khe) although I didn't talk to anybody in the Tashilhunpo. That is just what I heard. They did not work in detail about their land and just kept on complaining. The land size was tremendously different between Tashilhunpo and <a href "#" data-tooltip "[tib. བསམ་ཕོ] The abbreviated name of one of the largest and most powerful aristocratic families (Samdru Phodrang).">Sambo</a> -- Sambo's land was much smaller.   

**Q:**  In addition to the 5,000, did they have to pay any money also or was it just the 5,000 <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཁལ] A traditional volume measurement used for measuring grain in traditional Tibetan society. Sizes of this unit varied somewhat, but the official government khe (called mkhar ru or bstan dzin mkha ru) weighed about 28-31 pounds for barley. It was used to convey the size of fields. For example, a field said to be 10 khe in size meant that 10 khe of seed could be sown on that field.">khe</a> of grain?   

**A:**  I asked my late brother Tsögo if he had any Babshi to pay and Tsögo said that he did not have to pay any Babshi because he had a beautiful woman who was the estate steward so she slept with <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ལུང་ཤར] The family name of a famous aristocratic lay official during the time of the 13th Dalai Lama and the Regent Reting.">Lungshar</a> for 2-3 nights. [laughter] Therefore, he did not have to pay anything.   

**Q:**  Did he come personally?   

**A:**  Most probably he went to all these places.   

**Q:**  Did he go all over Tibet?   

**A:**  Most probably he traveled all over the country except the Kham area. That was a big job.   

**Q:**  How many years did it take him?   

**A:**  It should have taken him about two to three years.   

**Q:**  I heard that everyone says that the first few years of the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. སྟག་བྲག] The regent of Tibet who replaced Reting in 1941 and served until 1950 when the 14th Dalai Lama assumed power.">Taktra</a> period were very good years. What different things were done by Taktra?   

**A:**  He didn't have any special achievements to show. Reting was young and doing funny things, and <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. སྟག་བྲག] The regent of Tibet who replaced Reting in 1941 and served until 1950 when the 14th Dalai Lama assumed power.">Taktra</a> was older and more stable and didn't do reckless things. That is why people felt that it was little better than Reting. Otherwise he did nothing extraordinary.   

**Q:**  It seems to me that there were some good things that he did. Didn't <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. སྟག་བྲག] The regent of Tibet who replaced Reting in 1941 and served until 1950 when the 14th Dalai Lama assumed power.">Taktra</a> make an announcement that he wouldn't send any traders anywhere [on his behalf]. In case some traders were using the name of the Regent's <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. བླ་བྲང] 1. The property/wealth owning corporate entity of an incarnate lama. 2. The property/wealth owning corporate entity of the Panchen Lama.">labrang</a>, they should be accused in the respective places. Was that correct?   

**A:**  That was true. It may have been about a year that he was able to administer kind of fairly and dependably, since he was an old man.   

**Q:**  In 1942, he recreated the Foreign Office (Tib. ཆིགྱེ་ལེགུང [ཕྱི་རྒྱལ་ལས་ཁུངས]) so it seems that although he was an old man he was not against change.   

**A:**  There was a foreign office long before that. I have seen some photos of my grandfather who was then the Foreign Minister, but it is true that in 1942 he may have appointed Surkhang Surpa and Lobsang Palden [Tib. བློ་བཟང་དཔལ་ལྡན] or Liushar. Later, Liushar was definitely the person in charge. There was also Könchok Gyurme [Tib. དཀོན་མཆོག་འགྱུར་མེད].   

**Q:**  Könchok Gyurme was Yinggön Ta lama [Tib. དབྱིངས་མགོན་ཏ་བླ་མ] and probably he was not there at that time. Wasn't he dead then?   

**A:**  [tape unclear]   

**Q:**  I heard that in the autumn of 1943, 18 Tibetan military officers like <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. བརྒྱ་དཔོན་ཐོ] A military officer in charge of a unit of 100 soldiers.">gyagpön</a> and <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. རུ་དཔོན] A military officer in the traditional Tibetan Army just below a depön (commander). Rupön were usually in charge of half of a regiment (something like a battalion).">rupön</a> were sent to Gyantse for military training in things like firing cannons and so on, right.   

**A:**  I think this was true. Before that, we didn't have Bren-guns. I think that the leftovers of the Second World War, second hand weapons like Bren-guns, etc. were left in India, and some of the Political Officers in Sikkim asked [the Tibetans] if we needed any weapons. We said that we did. That is what I think they did.   

**Q:**  Do you think that at this time the Tibetans were more interested in making the army better? It seems that until 1944 the Government was doing good things like setting up schools?   

**A:**  After 1943, the glowing light of a good king was lost [Tib. འོད་ཤི་པ] and there was nothing.   

**Q:**  What do you mean the glowing light was lost? What do you mean happened?   

**A:**  He was unable to be fair and he depended entirely on what his <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཕྱག་མཛོད] A senior manager/treasurer of an aristocratic or monastic estate, or the senior manager/treasurer of an aristocratic family or a monastic unit. Generally chandzö handled both internal and external issues and were considered higher in power and status than nyerpa (stewards), who typically only handled the storerooms.">chandzö</a> told him to do and he was unable to think about a new idea or take some new methods. From 1943, he started losing everything and finally when he handed the political and spiritual power to the Dalai Lama, there was a song with the words, "King <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. སྟག་བྲག] The regent of Tibet who replaced Reting in 1941 and served until 1950 when the 14th Dalai Lama assumed power.">Taktra</a> offered it up, he offered up a political system in tatters." [Tib. ཕུལ་སོང་ལ་དང་ཕུལ་སོང། རྒྱལ་པོ་སྟག་བྲག་ཚང་གིས། ཆབ་སྲིད་རྩབ་རལ་ཕུལ་སོང] By that time, Taktra became really baseless or without substance.   

**Q:**  Are you also saying that there was a lot of bribery?   

**A:**  Then he became like a drawing or painting on the wall and he didn't have anything.   

**Q:**  He did not do anything?   

**A:**  They did not do anything. They did not say anything in front of him, but behind his back everyone called him "Porto" [Tib. སྤོར་ཏོ] (old man). Nobody called him Rimpoche. They just called him Taktra.   

**Q:**  Well, he didn't have any women or anything like that, did he?   

**A:**  Since he was an old man he could not have any. [laughter]   

**Q:**  One of the big events during his early rule was that the Chinese wanted to build a road and there was an American. Do you remember any of those things?   

**A:**  I heard that they wanted to use it for military transportation through Tibet, but then they [the Tibetan Government] refused to permit a road for military purposes. However, they were prepared to allow construction of a road for non-military purposes. And two people were sent through Kham on horseback. I heard when I was in jail that two people, either American or English, had come.   

**Q:**  Were you a government official then?   

**A:**  Yes.   

**Q:**  Do you remember clearly what they were discussing in the Tsondu gyendzom or in the government official circles?   

**A:**  At that time, we were not allowed to attend the more important meetings. Later on, in prison, we heard something about giving permits to the Americans or the British to use the roads through Tibet. It was confirmed later while in prison by fellow prisoners from the Kham area.   

**Q:**  After the Lhundrup Dzong affair, there were a number of incidents in which friends of Reting like Phünkang Jedrung, Jogtre, and Phünkang <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ས་དབང་ཆེན་མོ] One of the heads of the Kashag [bka&#x27; shag] or Council of Ministers. Sawangchemmo was also a term of address for a Kalön/Shape.">Sawangchemmo</a> were demoted, right?   

**A:**  Later Phünkang Jedrung sort of disappeared and didn't have a place to stay. Before that, he lived like the queen of Reting. In the beginning, Phünkang Jedrung was a student at the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཡིག་ཚང] The highest office dealing with monastic and religious affairs in the traditional Tibetan government. It is often called the Ecclesiastic Office. It was headed by 4 fourth rank monk officials called Trunyichemmo. The senior Trunyichemmo was called Ta Lama.">Yigtsang</a> and he didn't have any rank in the government. He was not a fully commissioned official. He became kind of the queen when he was a student, so he was taken up by that and he neither stayed as a student nor became a monk official, but every one regarded him as queen to the Regent [his lover]. However, he did not enjoy any rank or title. Just before Reting retired, he was appointed as a <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཤོད་མགྲོན] Monk officials working in the Secretariat of the Regent. They were something like an aide-de-camp.">shöndrön</a>, and after Reting retired he became old and gradually faded from the limelight and nobody paid attention to him. After that, he was sent to serve with the Khendrönlosum.   

**Q:**  After Reting went back to the Reting monastery, did Phünkang Jedrung go with Reting or did he remain in Lhasa?   

**A:**  He remained in Lhasa. He was probably a little too old then.   

**Q:**  While in Lhasa was he working in the government then?   

**A:**  He was a government official of the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཤོད་མགྲོན] Monk officials working in the Secretariat of the Regent. They were something like an aide-de-camp.">shöndrön</a> rank under Taktra. In 1942 or 1943, they appointed Jedrung as one of the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. མཁན་མགྲོན་ལོ་གསུམ] The three monk officials (mkhan chung, rtse mgron, and lo rtsa ba) sent to Beijing during the Qing Dynasty by the Tibetan government to teach the Qing royal family written Tibetan so they could read prayer books. They also performed rituals for the royal family. After the Qing dynasty fell, the Tibetan government continued to station three such monk officials in Beijing where they functioned as a Bureau Office for the Tibetan government in China.">Khendrönlosum</a> to be posted in China. When he asked for leave not to go to China, so he was dismissed from government service.   

**Q:**  Did he say he was unable to go or that he did not want to go?   

**A:**  He said that he did not want to go, and was unable to go.   

**Q:**  Did he give any reasons?   

**A:**  Some excuse of illness most likely. So he was dismissed from the service.   

**Q:**  Did they give any punishment or anything else?   

**A:**  No, he was not given any punishment.   

**Q:**  Why did they select Phünkang Jedrung as one of the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. མཁན་མགྲོན་ལོ་གསུམ] The three monk officials (mkhan chung, rtse mgron, and lo rtsa ba) sent to Beijing during the Qing Dynasty by the Tibetan government to teach the Qing royal family written Tibetan so they could read prayer books. They also performed rituals for the royal family. After the Qing dynasty fell, the Tibetan government continued to station three such monk officials in Beijing where they functioned as a Bureau Office for the Tibetan government in China.">Khendrönlosum</a>? Did they do it purposely?   

**A:**  It may not have been purposely done, but since they had to choose someone they chose him.   

**Q:**  So that was one of the reasons why Reting held a grudge against Taktra. Then the second reason had something to do with Jogtre, right?   

**A:**  There had been a law case, a big case between Künsangtse and Jogtre regarding some of the shidü. Probably Künsangtse's shidü was taking away a man who belonged to Jogtre. I do not remember very clearly, but they had a big aggressive case and the Tsikhang did the investigation. The <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཕྱག་མཛོད] A senior manager/treasurer of an aristocratic or monastic estate, or the senior manager/treasurer of an aristocratic family or a monastic unit. Generally chandzö handled both internal and external issues and were considered higher in power and status than nyerpa (stewards), who typically only handled the storerooms.">chandzö</a> of Phala appeared in the Tsikhang on behalf of Künsangtse because Künsangtse's daughter had married into the Phala family. So the chandzö appeared and he requested, "May we not hand over the sheep for slaughtering to the butcher." [Tib. ཤན་པའི་ལག་པར་བཤས་ལུག་སྤྲོད་མ་དགོས་པ་ཅིག]   

**Q:**  What did that mean?   

**A:**  That meant that the person should not be handed over to Jogtre's side; otherwise it would be like sending a sheep to the butcher. To that Jogtre replied, "You said that the abbot of <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. སེ་ར་བྱེས] The Jey (Je) College of Sera Monastery.">Sera Jey</a> [College] is a butcher."   

**Q:**  What did <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. སེ་ར་བྱེས] The Jey (Je) College of Sera Monastery.">Sera Jey</a> do?   

**A:**  Probably, the man who belonged to Künsangtse was taken away by Sera Jey. It seems that it didn't make much difference who won or lost, they were just fighting as a matter of pride and not tolerating each other.   

**Q:**  If <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. སེ་ར་བྱེས] The Jey (Je) College of Sera Monastery.">Sera Jey</a> was taking away the man who belonged to Künsangtse, then why would Jogtre get confronted?   

**A:**  I do not know how they were involved. Anyway, Jogtre was involved in that.   

**Q:**  How did it end, what happened?   

**A:**  It didn't make any difference to them who won and who lost. It was only fame and pride that pushed them on to fight.   

**Q:**  Was Jogtre jailed or demoted or something?   

**A:**  When this was going on, I was sitting in the Kashag and I heard that somebody was sent to seal Jogtre's [house]. I asked what happened, but on that day we didn't know for sure. After few days, we heard that probably they were suspicious that Jogtre had written something and <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཀ་ཤོད་པ] A famous Tibetan aristocrat who was involved in many important political intrigues.">Kapshöba</a> was supposed to have said something in the Kashag because he was close to Künsangtse. He said that it was very dangerous, and that they could not take the responsibility unless the house of the Jogtre was sealed. Then everyone in the Kashag agreed and suddenly it was sealed and there was nothing really important. [laughter] Then they set up an Investigation Committee, and my father was one of its members.   

**Q:**  When they sealed Jogtre's house, did they jail him in <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཤར་ཆེན་ལྕོགས] The prison used for political prisoners in traditional Tibet that was located in the east wing of the Potala Palace.">Sharchenjog</a> or removed his hair knot or something like that?   

**A:**  He was jailed in Lhogyü [Tib. ལྷོ་རྒྱུད], the prison located at the south side of the Jokhang.   

**Q:**  Did they remove his hair knot?   

**A:**  They might not have removed his hair knot. They just sealed his house.   

**Q:**  He was under arrest?   

**A:**  Yes. Jogtre was a good dharma friend of my father who was on the investigation committee. When his wife saw my father, she started to cry and my father assured her not to worry and that nothing would happen. This I do remember. Jogtre was a good poet and he used to send poems to people from the jail. He even wrote one to my father. When he was released, I was sent to console him, and he gave me a poem. I do not remember the words, but it meant that on the day of his release there had been a snowfall and this indicates that his heart was pure white.   

**Q:**  Were you there the day he was released? Why should he be sad, he should have been happy?   

**A:**  Because they sealed his house or something. That was the custom -- happy and sad at the same time. At that time he said that he and my father were good friends and he felt very grateful to him and expressed his gratitude for his help. Also he said that it was <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཀ་ཤོད་པ] A famous Tibetan aristocrat who was involved in many important political intrigues.">Kapshöba</a> who did all this. This I remember. After that, he thought that it may not be good to stay there any longer. Normally he was quite a good religious person, and soon after this he resigned totally from government service and he left. He then remained in Gyantse for a while and then he went to India, settled down there, and died in India.   

**Q:**  How did Phünkang <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ས་དབང་ཆེན་མོ] One of the heads of the Kashag [bka&#x27; shag] or Council of Ministers. Sawangchemmo was also a term of address for a Kalön/Shape.">Sawangchemmo</a> resign?   

**A:**  Phünkang had a son, popularly known as Geshela, and a daughter who was married to one of the Dathang's [sons][Tib. mda' thang ?]. She therefore was known as Dathang Lhajam. Geshe la's father was Phünkang <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ས་དབང་ཆེན་མོ] One of the heads of the Kashag [bka&#x27; shag] or Council of Ministers. Sawangchemmo was also a term of address for a Kalön/Shape.">Sawangchemmo</a>, but the mother was different. They did not get along well with their stepmother as she did not treat them well. Geshela had joined Drepung Monastery. Normally, they had to send some things (shagche) to Geshela [for his monk's apartment (shag)]. Shagche means the things needed in the apartment of a monk, like tables, altars, furniture, etc. However, the shagche they sent him was not befitting the son of Phünkang so he requested some more [from the Phünkang family], but Phünkang Lhajam refused. Moreover, there were some people who were instigating these two [children] to demand more from the Phünkang family. They told them to make an appeal to the government. They also told them that there may be a possibility of their being arrested for a few days, but they would later get their share of the property from the Phünkang family. Under the present conditions, they would not get anything, but since the government did not like them they made an appeal to the government.   

**Q:**  Who instigated them?   

**A:**  One of the Phünkang's servants instigated them. The servants did not like the Lady Phünkang (Lhajam) because she was very short-tempered and often scolded them. The servants did not like her and among themselves referred to her as Hadü [Tib. ཧ་ཅང་བདུད་མོ] [the female evil spirit or ogress in Tibetan opera]s. So Geshela thought that the servant was probably right and he presented an appeal. The appeal was made by Geshela and the Lady Dathang (Lhajam). In the appeal, he mentioned that Phünkang Lhajam was saying that the Regent, <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. སྟག་བྲག] The regent of Tibet who replaced Reting in 1941 and served until 1950 when the 14th Dalai Lama assumed power.">Taktra</a>, was having an affair with a woman known as Nying Asong [Tib. སྙིང་ཨ་སོང]. I do not know whether Phünkang Lhajam had said this for sure, but Geshela had mentioned this in the petition. When the petition reached the Kashag, they said that Phünkang Lhajam should be given one hundred lashes. The Lhajam offered to pay money in place of receiving the lashes [Tib. རུག་དོད]. Geshela probably got lashed 50-60 times and was given a little two story house attached to the main Phünkang house as his share of the property. As a punishment, the government confiscated Phünkang's Kharag Estate. Phünkang <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ས་དབང་ཆེན་མོ] One of the heads of the Kashag [bka&#x27; shag] or Council of Ministers. Sawangchemmo was also a term of address for a Kalön/Shape.">Sawangchemmo</a> was demoted in the sense that he was given the title of a Gung. This rank is equivalent to a <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཞབས་པད] One of the heads of the Kashag [bka&#x27; shag] or Council of Ministers. There were usually 4 Shape or Kalön, although in the 1950s the number increased at various times to 6 or 7. The ministers made decisions collectively and had no fixed term of office.">Shape</a>, but is different in that he could not attend the Kashag office as he used to do when he was a Shape, and he also had no gagpa.   

**Q:**  Was this before the Sera trouble?   

**A:**  Yes, it was before that.   

**Q:**  Was it before you went to India with that group?   

**A:**  Yes.   

**Q:**  Was this before you went to India, in 1947?   

**A:**  Yes, it was probably in 1945-1946.   

**Q:**  At the time when <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཀ་ཤོད་པ] A famous Tibetan aristocrat who was involved in many important political intrigues.">Kapshöba</a> was appointed as a <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ས་དབང་ཆེན་མོ] One of the heads of the Kashag [bka&#x27; shag] or Council of Ministers. Sawangchemmo was also a term of address for a Kalön/Shape.">Sawangchemmo</a>, some people say that he offered 50,000 <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. རྡོ་ཚད] A currency unit in traditional Tibet that was equal to 50 ngüsang.">dotse</a> as a bribe.   

**A:**  Such was the talk.   

**Q:**  Do you think that this money was given to the Regent directly or was it given to the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཕྱག་མཛོད] A senior manager/treasurer of an aristocratic or monastic estate, or the senior manager/treasurer of an aristocratic family or a monastic unit. Generally chandzö handled both internal and external issues and were considered higher in power and status than nyerpa (stewards), who typically only handled the storerooms.">chandzö</a>? Did <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. སྟག་བྲག] The regent of Tibet who replaced Reting in 1941 and served until 1950 when the 14th Dalai Lama assumed power.">Taktra</a> know about it? Or how was it?   

**A:**  At that time, probably he didn't give so much money. Probably he promised to pay a big sum of money. The sum of 50,000 <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. རྡོ་ཚད] A currency unit in traditional Tibet that was equal to 50 ngüsang.">dotse</a> was a huge sum, beyond our imaginations, and I do not think that the whole amount was paid. I doubt if he paid the full amount.   

**Q:**  Do you think the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. སྟག་བྲག] The regent of Tibet who replaced Reting in 1941 and served until 1950 when the 14th Dalai Lama assumed power.">Taktra</a> himself knew about it or how was it?   

**A:**  How could he not know this? I think that he pretended not to know, but I feel that he really knew about it.   

**Q:**  In Reting's time, Reting was interested in building up his <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. བླ་བྲང] 1. The property/wealth owning corporate entity of an incarnate lama. 2. The property/wealth owning corporate entity of the Panchen Lama.">labrang</a> and keeping fancy people around. What was <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. སྟག་བྲག] The regent of Tibet who replaced Reting in 1941 and served until 1950 when the 14th Dalai Lama assumed power.">Taktra</a> doing with all this money? Was he building up his labrang or was he constructing new labrangs?   

**A:**  He built a new <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. བླ་བྲང] 1. The property/wealth owning corporate entity of an incarnate lama. 2. The property/wealth owning corporate entity of the Panchen Lama.">labrang</a> when he became the Regent. They finished it in 1943 and invited all the government officials and preformed the opera for good luck. He also bought the old <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཞྭ་སྒབ་པ] The name of the family of an important lay official during the 1940s and 1950s.">Shakabpa</a> house in Lhasa. Then he became a big man.   

**Q:**  Were there any other supporters or close people of Reting who were hurt or demoted during this period?   

**A:**  Let's see, there is the Jigyab Khembo an important post, above that was the Khembo Ngawang Tenzin of <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཞོལ] The walled town beneath the Potala Palace in Lhasa.">Shöl</a>, the Jayangshar Khembo [Tib. འཇམ་དབྱངས་ཤར]. Now let's see, the Drunyichemmo Ngagpa la [Tib. སྔགས་པ་ལགས] passed away, and then there was another one, but I do not remember him. Anyway, then the tsipön and the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཞབས་པད] One of the heads of the Kashag [bka&#x27; shag] or Council of Ministers. There were usually 4 Shape or Kalön, although in the 1950s the number increased at various times to 6 or 7. The ministers made decisions collectively and had no fixed term of office.">Shape</a> gradually resigned or were made to resign. Among the Shape, Phünkang was one of the more prominent ones who was made to resign. Lhalu replaced him as Shape.   

**Q:**  Who were the ones to get out?   

**A:**  <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཀ་ཤོད་པ] A famous Tibetan aristocrat who was involved in many important political intrigues.">Kapshöba</a>. Ngabö took Kapshöba's place and Lhalu became a Shape.   

**Q:**  Lhalu came in whose place?   

**A:**  Lhalu probably came in Driyü's [Tib. འབྲི་ཡུལ] place. No, <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཞྭ་སྒབ་པ] The name of the family of an important lay official during the 1940s and 1950s.">Shakabpa</a> came in Driyü's place.   

**Q:**  T<a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཞྭ་མོ; ch. 戴帽] 1. A regular hat, cap. 2. A common political slang term (label) used for people who were classified as class enemies or reactionaries. It was used politically as, &quot;They put the hat on him,&quot; or &quot;They never took his hat off.&quot;">hat</a>'s why the song came out, "The female yak [Driyü] was slapped and the hat [Shakabpa] got a double hat." [Tib. འདྲི་ལ་འགྲམ་ལྕག་གཞུས་ནས། ཞྭ་ལ་ཞྭ་མོ་ཉིས་རྩེག] Was Driyü one of Reting's men?   

**A:**  He was insignificant. He just drank <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. 1. ཆང, 2. བྱང] 1. Tibetan locally brewed barley beer. 2. North; nomad areas north of Lhasa in Nagchuga Prefecture 3. ch. 厂 factory.">chang</a> the whole day.   

**Q:**  How did he get thrown out?   

**A:**  Driyü had made some mistakes in the accounts of the Investigation Office [Tib. ཞིབ་ཁང], something like that, it was a very small matter.   

**Q:**  They threw him out of the service from the post of tsipön?   

**A:**  He was made to leave his post of tsipön.   

**Q:**  What rank did they leave for him?   

**A:**  He was demoted to the fifth rank, letsenpa.   

**Q:**  Am I right in thinking that <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཞྭ་སྒབ་པ] The name of the family of an important lay official during the 1940s and 1950s.">Shakabpa</a> also did not like Reting because he was too rude, and his Uncle <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཁྲི་སྨོན] The name of the aristocratic family of an important lay official .">Trimön</a> was forced to resign. So he would have had some hostility towards Reting.   

**A:**  It is possible that he was anti-Reting, but he was definitely close to Taktra. I had spoken with <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཞྭ་སྒབ་པ] The name of the family of an important lay official during the 1940s and 1950s.">Shakabpa</a>, but he didn't say bad things about Reting at all. It was not this Lhalu, this one was the bridegroom. Before that, there were was the Lhalu Gung who had a fat wife and they had a son who was the same age as my late father. They had been to school together and learned the culture from the same place. They were friends. Sometimes, my father would stay for two or three nights at Lhalu's place and sometimes he would spend two or three nights at Sambo. So once the Gung got ill and he passed away, his wife was really sad and worried--which is natural. Then the son also died when he was 16 years old, so the Lhajam was left all alone. So they decided that it was better to ask for a bridegroom. There were two brothers, the former <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. རམ་པ] The family name of a well known aristocratic monk official who was a Kalön.">Ramba</a> Theiji and Kyitö [Tib. སྐྱིད་སྟོད] who had one wife. So Ramba Theiji was given to Lhalu, and there was a song "Lhalu is located near the mountains, so the lady went to the mountain, Ramba is located near the river, so they threw away [neglected] <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. སྐར་མ] 1. The smallest currency unit (a copper coin) in the traditional Tibetan currency system. Ten karma equaled 1 sho. 2. A work point in post-1959 Tibet. 3. A person&#x27;s name.">karma</a> into the river," [Tib. lha klu ri thag nye bas/ lha lcam ri la shor song/ ram pa qu thag nye bas/ las 'bras qu la bskur song] meaning that Ramba had a wife and kids, but still he was sent as a bridegroom. Probably he stayed there for about 4-5 months there. Then they said that they didn't get along well and he went back.   

**Q:**  What do you mean by Lhalu being near the mountains and she went to the mountain?   

**A:**  It meant that she was quite wild.   

**Q:**  I do not understand the last two lines of the song.   

**A:**  They had not honored <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. སྐར་མ] 1. The smallest currency unit (a copper coin) in the traditional Tibetan currency system. Ten karma equaled 1 sho. 2. A work point in post-1959 Tibet. 3. A person&#x27;s name.">karma</a> by throwing away the karma into the river.   

**Q:**  Meaning that it was not fair?   

**A:**  It wasn't fair at all, yes.   

**Q:**  Was it after this that Mrs. Lhalu started off for <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ལུང་ཤར] The family name of a famous aristocratic lay official during the time of the 13th Dalai Lama and the Regent Reting.">Lungshar</a>?   

**A:**  After a few months, four or five, <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. རམ་པ] The family name of a well known aristocratic monk official who was a Kalön.">Ramba</a> Theiji said he didn't get along well with Lhalu and he returned to the Ramba house. Like this, both the father and the son died. I saw that Lhalu had very big, man-size statues like Padmasambhava and I heard before that, that they were Nyingma sect. But at that time, the Lhajam urinated [probably at the front of the statues] and said, "You eat this. I had performed so many rituals when my late husband died, but it didn't help. I also performed so many rituals when my son died, but it was still useless. So from now on, I am not going to practice religion [Buddhism]." Like this she didn't practice religion. At that time, she met Phabongkha [Tib. ཕ་བོང་ཁ] Lama and told Phabongkha, "I am going to become Muslim." Phabongkha said, "Why are you going to become a Muslim?" Then she said, "When the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. གུང] A high title in the Tibetan government.">gung</a> and my son died, I performed so many rituals, but it didn't help. So I am not going to practice religion [Buddhism] and I am going to become Muslim." Then Phabongkha told her, "It doesn't mean that if you practice religion, you won't die. Nobody could perform rituals to avoid death. You shouldn't become a Muslim. If you don't want to be Nyingma, you can become Gelugpa. If you become a Muslim, how are you going to go among the people?" After Phabongkha gave her this instruction, probably she liked it and she decided to become Gelugpa. Since then, they just had the statues there, but she didn't practice Nyingma doctrine. Later, she had a great faith towards Phabongkha.
