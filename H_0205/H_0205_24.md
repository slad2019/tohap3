**A:** I thought he was the one who would respect the will of the majority of the people.   

**Q:**  Did they vote?   

**A:**  Yes. Whoever got the highest vote was sent as the first candidate and got the appointment. In 1953, between the 2nd and 3rd month, the 2 sitsab were forced to resign. Then at the end of the summer and the beginning of autumn, the Legjö (Reform) office was started.   

**Q:**  It was headed by Surkhang and Ngabö, right?   

**A:**  Surkhang came just before the revolt, otherwise it was Ngabö.   

**Q:**  Were there only government officials or many other people?   

**A:**  There were some representatives of the three great monasteries and there were also some abbots.   

**A:**  [Gelek:] Yes, there were the abbots named Shasur Chöndze and the Ngagpa Khembo [Tib. sngag pa mkhan po].   

**A:**  They [the Reform Office] issued an edict known as the "printed edict" (Tib. gagya parma [bka' rgya]). It was distributed everywhere and said that many people had to pay only half the amount of the old loans they owed. The miser had a lot of loans, and most these were exempt from paying the interest. All this was dependent on how long the loans were outstanding. The older loans were let off leniently whereas the more recent loans were made to be paid either in half or so on. The order, furthermore, made it clear that no new loans were to be given out at the rate of 20% [Tib. lnga drug 'gro] and 25% [Tib. bzhi lnga 'gro]. For new loans, the interest should be 14% [Tib. bdun brgyad 'dro]. No interest or repayment had to be paid for loans given 15 years or earlier. Loans within 15 years were subject to repayment of half, but no interest or partial interest depending on how (long) these loans had been outstanding. And all the dzong and estates were nationalized, and all the income had to go to the government. Except for the monasteries, people welcomed this new move. The monastic estates, however, raised very strong objections--especially Ganden monastery. Ganden had given endowment loans for the autumn retreat that was known as Tönchö [Tib. ston mchod] at 25% interest. They said that if they have to reduce it to 14%,it would be very difficult to manage because the endowments had to be handed over and accounted for to the next people coming into the office, so it was only with the interest that they could manage to meet the expenditures of this prayer meeting. It was like the proverb, "Handing over the root and the giving the tonggo with the leaves." [Tib. rtsa ba'i rtsis sprod/ lo mas gtong sgo]. They gave a lot of trouble for a long time. Similarly, the travel document, the lamyig, was strictly controlled and it was the beginning of a little happiness for the ordinary miser. The Dalai Lama also advised Loseling [Tib. ser byes blo gsal gling] Tratsang to be more kind to their miser. The Dalai Lama also told his own Namgyal [Tib. rnam rgyal] Tratsang that, "Wherever I go I find that your miser are the poorest and most ill-treated. So you should take care of your miser." Those things used to cheer me up and I used to think that gradually things will improve, but at about that time, the Khamba trouble started. After that came 1959.   

**Q:**  In the old system, under the 13th Dalai Lama and the Regent, how were tsidrung able to make a living? The aristocratic officials had their own estates, but how did the tsidrung make a living?   

**A:**  The tsidrung had no estates so whenever they went to a dzong [as governors] they would try to amass as much wealth as possible from the miser. That was their source of income. After 1953, the dzong were nationalized so the shungyuba were tremendously relieved because no extra burden was being placed on them by the dzong.   

**Q:**  Still, a lot of the tsidrung did not hold jobs in the dzong all the time, so how did they make an income when they were not in the dzong?   

**A:**  Their terms of office in the dzong were about three years so during this time they would try to do their best to accumulate as much wealth as possible. Maybe their earnings during the 3 year tenure would last them for about 7-8 years.   

**Q:**  Did they engage in trade?   

**A:**  Some of them would invest these earnings in business, but most of them didn't.   

**Q:**  Besides this, didn't they get any wages or salary?   

**A:**  After 1953, everyone got a salary.   

**Q:**  What about a tsidrung position such as a nendrön, shöndrön and so on?   

**A:**  There was no question about the nendrön [who had a very good income from taking bribes]. The tsendrön and shöndrön were normally selected from the better off families because they had to wear very good clothes.   

**Q:**  What would be the best position in Lhasa if a person wanted to make a lot of money?   

**A:**  If there was a Regent, then the nendrön made the most money. If there was no Regent, the Drönyerchemmo. There was no question about the Shape and the drunyichemmo posts [equally profitable]   

**Q:**  What about the tsipön?   

**A:**  The tsipön doesn't get any salary, but being a lay official they had estates of their own. So they were okay.   

**Q:**  They could also get bribes because there were many law cases they decided, right?   

**Q:**  Yes. Attending the Tsikhang was their main job, but besides this they had many additional responsibilities in various offices like the Shimbar. So they got enough.   

**Q:**  What about the Laja?   

**A:**  The Laja and the Tseja used to borrow things from their own offices. They would make a note on a samtra and when the board was filled, they would rub it off [laughter]. All the clerks were there and whatever you requested, they would bring you.   

**Q:**  What did you borrow, cash or things in-kind?   

**A:**  Anything.   

**Q:**  Did they borrow things with the idea of doing businesses and making some profit?   

**A:**  If they borrowed money from the endowment [Tib. theb sbyar], they had to pay interest and repay the loan on time, so to borrow money was quite difficult because all the money of this office went towards the expenditures of the Mönlam Festival. If the money was given out as loans and not returned on time, the monks would really raise hell.   

**Q:**  They definitely had to pay the interest to the Endowment Office yearly on time, right?   

**A:**  Yes.   

**Q:**  Probably, the Laja didn't have money, right?   

**A:**  Yes. Normally they could borrow goods like butter, grain, woolen yarns and so on. So you borrowed money it was only in cases of emergency and then just for a short period.   

**Q:**  What about the Tseja?   

**A:**  It was the same thing. The Laja was the main office. The Tseja was also called Trede which means easy to collect things quickly [Tib. 'phral du len bde ba]. It was a branch of the Laja. They created the Tseja near the Dalai Lama's palace so that they didn't have to go all the way to the Laja office to get something.   

**A:**  [Gelek:] This was mainly created to provide supplies for the Dalai Lama's kitchen.   

**A:**  Yes, that's right. The Tseja had all the items that the Laja had, although not as much quantity.   

**Q:**  Why did some aristocrats make their sons tsidrung, e.g., Phala Drönyerchemmo, Surkhang Khenjung, Shölkang and Trendong [Tib. bkras mthong] and Ramba?   

**A:**  Normally, it depended on the individual. Sometimes the sons didn't get the chance to go as a groom or a chance to get a bride according to their social status, so they enrolled them into the tsidrung ranks. Most probably these were the reasons.   

**A:**  [Gelek:] The elder sons of Phala and Ramba were tsidrung.   

**Q:**  If a person became a tsidrung, would he get any share of the family estate?   

**A:**  If they lived together, that's it. Later, if they got separated, they would get a share.   

**Q:**  For example, what about Chemmo [Phala]? In the case of the Phala family, Chemmo was the most senior son and he was also a tsidrung, so his younger brother must listen to him. Supposing if they didn't get along well, then the younger ones like Phogpön would have to leave the family, right?   

**A:**  Phogpön would not leave.   

**Q:**  In case they fought, the younger might have to leave, right?   

**A:**  Yes. On the other hand, in the Surkhang family, Surkhang Shape was the most senior son. Then came Surkhang Depön and finally Surkhang Khenjung, so the Shape would let his younger brother do whatever he wishes to do except bringing home a wife. In the Phala family, the two younger brothers would do whatever their eldest monk brother advised.
