**Q:**  What happened after that?   

**A:** 
 In the 2nd month, the Trapchi [Tib. grwa bzhi] soldiers were mobilized and a big war took place.   

**Q:**  I will repeat what you told me in brief. Please check if there is any wrong: The Trapchi soldiers went to bring Reting and they crossed the Gola mountain pass and brought him through the front of the Sera Monastery. At that time, the monks came out from the stone floor area, but there were no monks near the Ketshang [Tib. ke tshang] [Hermitage]. They were coming down from the stone floor and the Jirigang [Tib.?]. At that time, they fired Brenguns from two sides of the Trapchi [Regiment]. The soldiers of the Gusung Regiment were in the sand dam or Jerag [Tib. bye rag] area and they fired shots. Therefore, the monks withdrew. About two days before that, the Gusung soldiers were stationed in Tsesumthang [Tib. tshes gsum thang] and Bari Tsenkhang [Tib. ba ri btsan khang]. When the real war took place, the Trapchi soldiers came down from the mountain top and the Gyantse soldiers came from Chubsang [Tib. chu bzang] while the Gusung soldiers came up from the front of the [monastery]. The big war took place on the 7th and it was not concluded. The soldiers went to the monastery on the 8th. At that time, you were a shengo and a trumpeter and you were with Rupön [Tib. ru dpon] Bükhangwa [Tib. sbud khang ba]. When you went in the monastery on the 9th, probably about 400 monks had been killed and most of the heads and the hands were taken by the Gyantse soldiers, was that correct?   

**A:**  Yes.   

**Q:**  Who cut off the ears [of the killed monks]?   

**A:**  The Trapchi soldiers cut off the ears. [laughing]. In the past, normally, the soldiers would go through the motions of cutting off the heads and the hands of the killed soldiers in Kham. At that time, we were told not to cut off the heads and the hands but to cut off the ears. So we just cut off the ears and left the body there. In Jirigang we didn't kill many monks.   

**Q:**  You said that the monks were shooting from the Tsa Khamtshen [Tib. tsha ba], right?   

**A:** 
 Yes, on the 8th, 4 Trapchi soldiers were killed. When I came down from Jirigang, I saw two of them were killed in Chödinggang [Tib. chos lding sgang]. One of them was killed near the Samlo Khamtsen [Tib. bsam lho]. One of the old soldiers was killed near the wall and the rock. It was said that he was shot from Samlo Khamtsen.   

**Q:**  How many Gusung soldiers were killed?   

**A:** 
 They shot from the Tsa Khamtsen and killed Gusung soldiers and the monks also shot from the wall on the road to Nyangral [Tib. myang ral] and killed one of our trumpeters and I was left alone. Then I went up to the Thawog Linga [Tib. thub 'og gling ga]. Then I was told to blow the trumpet to call the soldiers. When the soldiers came up, two of the teachers and three majors were wounded. Altogether 12 soldiers were wounded. Then at about sunset, we went down and entered the Hamdong [Tib. har gdong] [khamtsen]. When we came along the Tratsang Je [Tib. byes], we saw that the monks had made bunkers out of the pile of assembly cushions and the monks charged forward carrying swords so we had to withdraw for a while. After that, we opened fire, though we couldn't kill monks, we entered the Ngagpa [tratsang] [Tib. sngags pa]. Then we blew a trumpet for calling all the soldiers saying that we had taken over the entire monastery. There was a volunteer fighting monk or dobdo [Tib. rdob rdob] nicknamed, "Burning fire on the forehead." Thökhog Member [Tib. thod khog me 'mar]. He came up charging forward through the stone floor of Ngagpa.   

**Q:**  Did he carry a sword?   

**A:** 
 He was carrying a mauser pistol in his hand. Right at that time, the Gyantse Shengo whose [one] eye was blind, shot the monk. He blew off his skull. After that, the only way to enter Sera Je college was to use hand grenades. Otherwise, we were unable to get through because the monks were filled inside.   

**Q:**  I heard that the monks were hiding in the assembly hall.   

**A:** 
 Yes. When he threw the hand grenade, it didn't even break the window glass much. Only the glass of the front main room or Rabsel [Tib. rab gsal] got a little bit damaged. At that time, Sera Je was handed over to us, the Gusung soldiers. This was because we had never been to make war. So they were afraid that the other soldiers might take away things.   

**Q:**  Who handed you Sera Je?   

**A:** 
 It was the Dzasa Magji Kelsang Tsültrim [Tib. skal bzang tshul khrims]. At that time, even a needle was not lost from that place. The other soldiers took a little bit of foodstuffs and butter from Tsha Mitsen and Hamdong Khamtsen. I am not sure whether they took other things or not. 
  

**Q:**  That's how it goes usually.   

**A:** 
 Probably, there was a trülku in the Tsha Mitshen [Tib. mi tshan]. Some of our majors and shengos took away a few things from him. They also took away a few horses. But the [horses] didn't remain there for a long time, not even a year.   

**Q:**  After that, didn't you go back to Reting again?   

**A:** 
 After we were sent back from the monastery, in the morning, we were served tea from Sera Je and each of the soldiers were given 5 sho [Tib. zho]. Then we marched down from the monastery. The Gusung marched at the front and the next was the Trapchi and then the Gyantse troops. When we arrived at the Trapchi regiment, each of the soldiers were given a brand new 10 sang note. At that time, the leader was Kabshöpa. The money was paid by the Kashag. Then we, the Gusung soldiers, went directly back to Norbulinga and the Gyantse unit went back to their regiment and Trapchi remained in Trapchi. After two days, they were sent to Reting again.   

**Q:**  Did they sent the Trapchi soldiers?   

**A:** 
 At that time, the bearded Gusung Gyagpön Thönwang La [Tib. don dbang lags] who was a specialist for firing cannos, was sent with the Trapchi soldiers. 
 We were stationed in Sera for on guard for a few days. There was one shengo and a jugpön and altogether, there were 30 some soldiers. In Trehor Khamtsen, we were given two large tea bricks and two sacks of tsamba and a half load of butter. When we arrived at Trapchi, Kabshöpa prostrated towards the Potala and made us stand in a line and gave us 10 sang from his own hand.   

**Q:**  Didn't you go to arrest Kapshöba?   

**A:** 
 Yes, after that, I was told to go to arrest Kapshöba.   

**Q:**  Did they leave 15 or 17 soldiers in Reting?   

**A:** 
 They left one shengo and 15 soldiers.   

**Q:**  After that, the soldiers were destroyed. How did that occur?   

**A:** 
 Some people said that the soldiers were killed in Reting and some people said that volunteer monks of Sera went to Reting to kill them.   

**Q:**  How did they kill them?   

**A:** 
 I was not there. I don't know whether they were stabbed or shot.   

**Q:**  Didn't you hear anything about that?   

**A:** 
 I saw the clothes of the soldiers and there were 5-6 holes, but I am not sure whether they were stabbed or shot.   

**Q:**  All of thir clothes had holes, right?   

**A:** 
 Yes.   

**Q:**  This means they shot them.   

**A:** 
 Yes. 
 I heard they also set fire. 
 There was a house where the guard would stay near the gate of the summer cottage. Later, they burned the house. At that time, one of our soldiers was in that house and he shot upwards at the roof and also shot towards the door so they [the monks] couldn't handle him and they had to burn the house and he was also burned. Anyway, all 15 of the soldiers were killed. We departed on the night of 19th of thew 2nd Lunar month and went to Reting.   

**Q:**  At that time, the soldiers robbed many things, right?   

**A:** 
 At that time, the depön was Shükhüpa [Tib. shud khud pa]. We went there through Drigung Thakhe [Tib. 'bri gung [?]] and then went to the estate that belonged to Horkhang.   

**Q:**  That estate was called Gyama Trikhar [Tib. rgya ma khri mkhar].   

**A:** 
 From that place, we crossed the mountain pass.   

**Q:**  Did you sail coracles down the river from Drigung?   

**A:** 
 No, we walked all the way and went to Reting.   

**Q:**  Didn't many soldiers travel in coracles?   

**A:** 
 At that time, it was said that we won't be able to get through if we didn't travel in coracles. So we took two coracles from the Kharog Shenkha [Tib. kha rog shan kha] ferry site.   

**Q:**  Did you sail in the coracles?   

**A:** 
 The coracles were just used for crossing the river and not for sailing down the river.   

**Q:**  Just before you reached Reting, did you fight a little bit?   

**A:** 
 We didn't fight because we didn't see any monks.   

**Q:**  Didn't they shoot from among the forest?   

**A:**  There were just 1-2 shots fired from inside the forest which made a big sound. Probably, it was Pamala rifle. There wasn't any attack that we had to counter attack.
 We saw many cartridges strewb around there.   

**Q:**  You went there later on, right?   

**A:** 
 Yes.   

**Q:**  Were there cartridges at that time?   

**A:** 
 Yes. 
 When we threatened the villagers by turning the bolts of the rifles and asked them, "Where is the abbot and where are the monks? If you don't tell us, we will kill you." They said, "There isn't a single monk in the monastery. There are about 30 monks amidst the forests on the mountain and about 30 monks down there."   

**Q:**  Were there any soldiers who were with Rupön Bükhangwa?   

**A:** 
 Probably not.   

**Q:**  Were there any soldiers from the Tadang Regiment?   

**A:** 
 No.   

**Q:**  Wasn't there a Shengo Lolo [Tib. blo blo] of the Tadang Regiment?   

**A:** 
 I have never heard about him. Muja [Tib. mu bya] was the depön of the Gadang Regiment and Rupön Bükhangwa was lost in Denma [Tib. ldan ma]. Dergesey [Tib. sde dge sras was the depön of Tadang Regiment which surrendered to the Chinese.
 When the Dalai Lama went to China and we, one Squad [Tib. bcu shog] of soldiers went to Chamdo, on the way there was a hermitage and we went there wearing our uniform made from the American serge. We got there first and the [People's Liberation Army] regiment which used to be the Tadang Regiment, came later followed by some Chinese students. At that time, one of the rupön in the Tadang Regiment was a Khamba and we knew him. In the past, when I was about 18-19 old, we, some of the trumpeters, were sent to work on the construction on the Tibetan Medical Astrological Instrument, the Mentsikhang [Tib. sman rtsis khang] and at that time, that Gyagpön of the Tadang Regiment who was a Khamba was over there as a cadre and the two of us got into a fight and I beat him up and he was bleeding a lot. At that time, the Gusung Depön was Yuthok [Tib. g.yu thog]. Right after that, the whistle was blown for lunchtime. I thought that I would be beaten with switches because of the fight, but I didn't care. I took a Khata and went to the depön. Then the depön asked me, "Did he hit you? I said, "No." Then I went to back to the regiment and they asked me whether I got beaten with the switches and I said no. This was what happened in the past. When I met the Khamba Gyagpön in Chamdo, he didn't say anything. He just said, "You were a small boy and you have grown up a lot." At that time, Dergesey came up and he was very impudent to me [Tib. skyag khral shod] and said, "Who the hell told you to carry these guns?"   

**Q:**  Did he tell you, the Gusung soldiers?   

**A:** 
 Yes.   

**Q:**  Why?   

**A:** 
 He was the in charge of the Public Security Bureau [Ch. gong an ju] in Chamdo.   

**Q:**  But, you were the Gusung soldiers, right?   

**A:** 
 I told him, "When we came from Lhasa, Yuthok, the residence of the Chinese officials in Lhasa, both the Tibetan Government and the Chinese didn't tell us that we are not allowed to carry weapons. Are you saying that we are not allowed to carry weapons? Now, this is the condition of your soldiers here." At that time, the Tadang soldiers had cut their hairs short and they are wearing cloth uniform and going to carry fertilizer. Like this, I verbally fought with Dergesey very severely. After that, we had to buy some tea bricks in Chamdo. At that time, in Chamdo one tea brick cost 1 dayang and in Lhasa it is 45 srang. The tea bricks had to be bought from Dergesey. We didn't know any body in Chamdo in the past, we were just shut in the house right after we arrived there. Probably, we arrived at about 17th of the 4th Lunar month.   

**Q:**  You mean on your way back you arrived at Chamdo, right?   

**A:** 
 Yes, at that time, we had to sit facing each other with the Chinese and we didn't talk to each other.  After that, they  gave each of our soldiers 1,000 Chinese yuan as we thought it would be useless to take the dayang to Tibet. So this was the money for buying the tea bricks.   

**Q:**  Later, did he sell you the tea bricks?   

**A:** 
 I went to see him and I saluted to him and told him to sell a little bit of tea bricks to be used for gifts in Lhasa." He said, "How much do you need? I said, each of us need about 10 baskets of tea bricks." He sold us the tea bricks.   

**Q:**  So on the 13th of the 3rd month, you went to Reting, right?   

**A:** 
 On that day, we went to Reting to make the war, but when we arrived at Reting, we didn't need to make the war because there were no monks there. The monks were amidst the forest and they were shooting a little bit from there. At that time, we had the cannon and when we fired the cannon a little bit, they also fired shots from among the forest and the bullets fell near the mules, but there waren't any casualties. On the day when we brought the Regent Reting, one shelngo called Tenzin la [Tib. bstan 'dzin lags] was killed.   

**Q:**  Did they shoot him?   

**A:** 
 Yes, the shengo was from the Jangrashar Yuloshag [Tib. lcang ra shar g.yu lo shag].   

**Q:**  Didn't they said that the person who killed the shengo was Jangrashar chöndze, who was related to him?   

**A:** 
 On that day, he was overly brave and went carrying the gun called Lewis gun and then the monks shot him. We didn't know who killed him for 2-3 days and we said that the shengo was missing. After that, when we were able to arrest the ring leaders of Reting, we knew that he was shot dead.   

**Q:**  When the Trapchi soldiers came from Samlo or Hamdong carrying the military flag to be hoisted on the roof of the monastery assembly hall, the soldier had a son who was a monk and he killed his father and he himself was also killed, was that correct?   

**A:** 
 There wasn't any such thing that happened. 
 The soldier who was carrying the flag was from Nyan [Tib. gnyan] and they were not father and son. I saw that he was shot here [pointing his finger some where] and lost hold of the flag. So our gyagpön whose [one] eye was blind, picked up the flag. The soldier also didn't die. He was brought on a stretcher to the hospital in Dekyilinga [Tib. bde skyid gling ga].   

**Q:**  At that time, Reting was destroyed into pieces [Tib. ther tshal sbar tshal], right?   

**A:** 
 Yes, a lot of things were taken from Reting.   

**Q:**  At that time, did the magji prohibit the soldiers from taking things?   

**A:** 
 Yes, at that time, there was a soldier called Wangchug Chembo [Tib. dbang phyug chen po] who was doing things in a devil-may-care manner [Tib. skyid med sdug zad] and who later he became a major. He argued against the magji saying, "It was right that people say, "There should be looting when you lose the war [Tib. dmag shor jag shor]. You are saying that we are not allowed to take things. So bring me a fire without smoke and water without bubbles. [Tib. me la du ba med pa dang qu la lbu ba med pa]." He verbally fought against the magji and the magji was about to shoot him with his mauser pistol, but he didn't dare to. Then Wangchug Chembvo told the magji, "If you want to shoot me, go ahead and shoot! If not, I am going to shoot you." and he turned his gun bolt and loaded the gun and went to shoot the magji. Then one of the gyagpön intervened between them told them not to do that and the Kungö Shakabpa [Tib. zhwa sgab pa] and all of them seized him. He also verbally fought with Shakabpa.   

**Q:**  Shakabpa was the changji (Governor of the North), right?   

**A:** 
 Yes.   

**Q:**  At that time, who was the fourth rupön [of Trapchi]?   

**A:** 
 He was the late outer fifth rank [Tib. phyi'i gnas lnga pa], letsenpa [Tib. las tshan pa], Rupön Kelsang La [Tib. skal bzang lags].   

**Q:**  Was he the Rupön Kelsang during the Taktra regency?   

**A:** 
 No, this was the first rupön.   

**Q:**  Where did the fourth rupön live?   

**A:** 
 He lived near the Kaling Goshi [Tib. kar ne sgo bzhi] stupa.   

**Q:**  Do you know where he was from?   

**A:** 
 He was born in E [Tib. e] in Lhoka. He became a soldier and gradually became the letsenpa rupön.   

**Q:**  When did he get the letsenpa rank?   

**A:** 
 It had been quite a long time ago.   

**Q:**  Was that before the Reting war?   

**A:** 
 Yes, it was long before that.   

**Q:**  Who gave him the letsenpa title?   

**A:** 
 Probably, it was during Reting.
 No, it was not during Reting. Taktra gave him the letsenpa title. 
 Yes, probably it was during Taktra. The fourth rupön and rupön Anan Dawa [Tib. a nan zla ba] both got the fifth rank.   

**Q:**  Was that during Taktra?   

**A:** 
 Yes.   

**Q:**  Did they give the letsenpa for an accomplishment?   

**A:** 
 Probably, it was for their accomplishment from early times. 
 I don't understand this. There was a rupön called Bu tsering [Tib. bu tshe ring] who didn't make any war, but he also got the letsenpa. The master carpenter Phünkhangshar [Tib. phun khang shar] also got the letsenpa. Gyagpön Anan Dawa was very famous, but the fourth rupön was just a reliable person [Tib. tshugs chen po] in the regiment, otherwise, he didn't have any special [accomplishment].
