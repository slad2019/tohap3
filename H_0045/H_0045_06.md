**A:**  The number of <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. མི་སེར] A term that can mean serf/bound subject as well as citizen, depending on context. For example, the miser of a lord would connote the bound subjects of that lord, whereas the miser of Tibet would connote citizens of Tibet.">miser</a> depended on the size of the estate. Some of them had about 15-20 miser (families). Those aristocrats who had big estates had about 100 miser. The miser also had land according to the size of the estate. The miser had to work providing <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. འུལ་ལག] A generic term for corvée labor that had to be performed for one&#x27;s manorial estate/lord without pay. One kind of ula required people to go and work and another kind required the provision of transportation animals.">ula</a> for the aristocrat because they held land [from the estate]. When the miser came to work for ula, they were sent to plant the fields or do the other farming tasks. They [the lords] would give them a little food. That was the tax on the miser.   

**Q:**  I don't understand about the land-basis [Tib. རྟེན] the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. མི་སེར] A term that can mean serf/bound subject as well as citizen, depending on context. For example, the miser of a lord would connote the bound subjects of that lord, whereas the miser of Tibet would connote citizens of Tibet.">miser</a> had for providing <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. འུལ་ལག] A generic term for corvée labor that had to be performed for one&#x27;s manorial estate/lord without pay. One kind of ula required people to go and work and another kind required the provision of transportation animals.">ula</a>?   

**A:**  Yes, <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. མི་སེར] A term that can mean serf/bound subject as well as citizen, depending on context. For example, the miser of a lord would connote the bound subjects of that lord, whereas the miser of Tibet would connote citizens of Tibet.">miser</a> had a land-basis for doing ula.   

**Q:**  It is hard for you to talk about aristocrats in general because there were different systems. According to the system at Tsarong [Tib. ཚརོང] and Taring [Tib. ཕྲེང་རིང], for example, say one household had two sons and a father, and the elder son and father were getting along, but the younger son didn't get along well. Then if the two brothers took one bride and the younger son and the bride didn't get along with each other, and the younger son says that I can't live with my father and my brother and am going to separated, since that <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. མི་སེར] A term that can mean serf/bound subject as well as citizen, depending on context. For example, the miser of a lord would connote the bound subjects of that lord, whereas the miser of Tibet would connote citizens of Tibet.">miser</a> family had land, in this case would they be able to divide the land or not? If they could, how would they do that? Did they have to report it to the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. དཔོན་པོ, མངའ་བདག] 1. A manorial estate holder. 2. Chief of an area.">lord</a>? What was the traditional custom for that? I am confused.   

**A:**  We had the same custom among the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. མི་སེར] A term that can mean serf/bound subject as well as citizen, depending on context. For example, the miser of a lord would connote the bound subjects of that lord, whereas the miser of Tibet would connote citizens of Tibet.">miser</a> and also among the aristocrats. What you were saying is if there was the father and two sons and the younger son says he wants to get separated, then they would give a share to the younger son. If they agree to that, they didn't have to file the law case to the court. If they didn't agree to that, they could also file the case to court. Usually, the younger son would request them to give him a good share. If the older son   

**Q:**  Usually, they would give only money and things, not land, right?   

**A:**  Yes. If they had a large amount of land they would also give land and if they didn't have a large area of land then they wouldn't give the land. For example, in an aristocratic household like Taring's, if the brothers didn't get along, they would divide the estate and the best estate would be kept by the older brother and other smaller estates could be divided. You don't have to report it to the government. If you are not satisfied in the division of the estates, then you could report it to the government. If the government supported him and said the share that was given was too little, you had to give more as the share. Then you had to obey to the government order. As for the Taring family's <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. མི་སེར] A term that can mean serf/bound subject as well as citizen, depending on context. For example, the miser of a lord would connote the bound subjects of that lord, whereas the miser of Tibet would connote citizens of Tibet.">miser</a>, it was also the same. If they didn't get along among the brothers, then they would tell us and we would be completely fair and we would say that you should give more share to the younger brother. Otherwise they could also divide the land among themselves.   

**Q:**  Among the misers, were they allowed to sell the land to each other?   

**A:**  They could buy the land, and if they bought the land they also had to divide the tax which was levied on the land. They were obliged to pay or work for the tax according to the [size of the] land.   

**Q:**  If a Taring <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. མི་སེར] A term that can mean serf/bound subject as well as citizen, depending on context. For example, the miser of a lord would connote the bound subjects of that lord, whereas the miser of Tibet would connote citizens of Tibet.">miser</a> would sell one <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཁྲལ་རྐང] The name of the basic tax unit for arable land in traditional Tibetan society. Families with farm land would have one or more fields of different sizes, e.g., 1 tregang or 1/2 of a tregang. This was defined by a fixed number of khe of seed (tib. sönkhe) that would be sown on that field. For example, one tregang in some areas would consist of 10 sönkhe. There was substantial variation between and within regions and types of estates.">tregang</a> to another miser, did he have to report this to Taring, saying that "I am going to sell the land and he will be obliged to work for the tax"?   

**A:**  Yes, they had to tell Taring that they decided to do that.   

**Q:**  When they reported to the Taring, would Taring have any objection to that?   

**A:**  No. If they agreed to do that then we wouldn't have any objection to that. If they said that my father was not truthful and the father might say that no matter how much I gave him he still was not satisfied, we would say to the son, "Don't do this, your father has only this much [land]." If they didn't listen to us, they could also appeal the case to the dzong. There was a good thing in the Tibetan tradition. If a couple divorces or if they give the estate to each other, no matter whether the case was big or small, if you could make an agreement internally, they wouldn't go to the court. After making the agreement, the document of your estate which was issued by the government would be the main basis. Supposing if someone said "I will give the Taring [estate] to another person," then he had to give the document of the Taring's estate to the other person. Otherwise, the Taring estate wouldn't belong to that person. If a couple got divorced and if they gave a share, then you wouldn't have to report it to the government. If the case became bitter, then you had to report it to the government. If you did that, you had to spend lot of money and it was very hard because you had to tell many people. If they made an agreement among themselves, that would be very good. You could also give the estate to your father and the father could also give an estate to his son. The only thing you had to do was to make a good agreement and you needed to have one witness. In the document, for the headline, you would write, "To the political and temporal master of the law [Tib. ལུགས་གཉིས་གོང་མ་ཁྲིམ་བདག་རིན་པོ་ཆེ]" and at the end they would write, "If we don't get along then we will accept whatever the government orders or whatever the punishment." That was a very important agreement. You could make the decision by yourself. It was strange.   

**Q:**  In Tibet the younger son had fewer rights, right?   

**A:**  If there were two sons, the elder son had more rights than the younger one. If there was a son and a daughter then the son had more right than the girl. Among the daughters the elder daughter had more rights.   

**Q:**  Supposing the boy belonged to another <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. དཔོན་པོ, མངའ་བདག] 1. A manorial estate holder. 2. Chief of an area.">lord</a> like Rimpoche and the girl belonged to Taring, then what would happen?   

**A:**  If the boy was a <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. མི་སེར] A term that can mean serf/bound subject as well as citizen, depending on context. For example, the miser of a lord would connote the bound subjects of that lord, whereas the miser of Tibet would connote citizens of Tibet.">miser</a> of Rimpoche, then he would pay <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. མི་བོགས] A status wherein a peasant &quot;leased&quot; his/her &quot;freedom&quot; from his/her lord to live and work where he/she wanted. The peasants with human lease status still belonged to their lord and were required to pay an annual fee (&quot;human lease fee&quot;) to their lord. The children of human lease peasants inherited this status from parents of the same sex (i.e. sons of a male belonged to their father&#x27;s lord).">mibo</a> to Rimpoche and the girl would pay mibo to us. It was like if I was an aristocrat and if I took a bride for my son from one of Rimpoche's miser, I had to ask for permission [Tib. mi 'krol] from Rimpoche.   

**Q:**  You mean to say that if the boy and the girl were aristocrats?   

**A:**  No. I am the aristocrat, and if I took a bride for my son from among your <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. མི་སེར] A term that can mean serf/bound subject as well as citizen, depending on context. For example, the miser of a lord would connote the bound subjects of that lord, whereas the miser of Tibet would connote citizens of Tibet.">miser</a>, e.g., your female servant, then when she came to our house she would become the wife of an aristocrat. So I had to request Rimpoche to give the girl to us. Sometimes, we needed to pay a lot of money and they would give her to us. If that household was your friend or relative then you didn't need to pay the money and they would give their daughter to you.   

**Q:**  If one of our <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. མི་སེར] A term that can mean serf/bound subject as well as citizen, depending on context. For example, the miser of a lord would connote the bound subjects of that lord, whereas the miser of Tibet would connote citizens of Tibet.">miser</a>'s daughters went as a bride to one of the servants of Taring, then did we have to ask for [mi krol]?   

**A:**  No, you didn't need to ask for [Tib. མི་ཀྲོལ]. We also asked for person exchange of the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. མི་སེར] A term that can mean serf/bound subject as well as citizen, depending on context. For example, the miser of a lord would connote the bound subjects of that lord, whereas the miser of Tibet would connote citizens of Tibet.">miser</a> [Tib. མི་བརྗེས]. I would tell you that I will give you one person who is capable because there are many people. We can make that boy and girl to become part of the Taring miser and sometimes, they would just give the people if they had a friendly relationship. They would give a servant and a maidservant to friends and relatives who were short of servants. They had the power to give the miser to other people. If they said that they gave the miser, then you didn't need to pay anything.   

**Q:**  The <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. མི་སེར] A term that can mean serf/bound subject as well as citizen, depending on context. For example, the miser of a lord would connote the bound subjects of that lord, whereas the miser of Tibet would connote citizens of Tibet.">miser</a> of Taring on the estate were called <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཁྲལ་པ] The class of bound peasant/miser/serf households who held farmland and had to fulfill large corvée tax obligations to their manorial estates/lords. They are often called taxpayer households in English. While some of these were well off by local standards, many were poor due to a variety of factors such as heavy debts and a dearth of able-bodied workers in their households.">treba</a> or <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. དུད་ཆུང] Literally &quot;small smoke.&quot; A type of peasant/serf/miser in traditional Tibetan society that belonged to an estate/lord, but did not hold tax-base land (tib. ཁྲལ་རྟེན). They usually were poor and survived by working for others or leasing land from treba (taxpayer) households or sometimes from their estate.">düjung</a>?   

**A:**  Among our <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. མི་སེར] A term that can mean serf/bound subject as well as citizen, depending on context. For example, the miser of a lord would connote the bound subjects of that lord, whereas the miser of Tibet would connote citizens of Tibet.">miser</a>s there were two kinds. One was the taxpayer household and the other was the düjung. These two were different in the work they did as a tax. The taxpayer households had large land holdings and the small householder didn't have land or they had just a small piece land for doing the farming. So the small householders were poorer. They also had to work less as a corvee tax than the taxpayer households, because they didn't have land. For the taxpayer household miser, they also had to work for taxes differently according to their land. It was very popular in Tibet that the calculation of land and taxes was done according to many different percentages.   

**Q:**  MCG: Did the taxpayer households have land tenure documents to prove that the land belonged to them?   

**A:**  For example, all the Taring <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. མི་སེར] A term that can mean serf/bound subject as well as citizen, depending on context. For example, the miser of a lord would connote the bound subjects of that lord, whereas the miser of Tibet would connote citizens of Tibet.">miser</a>'s names were written in the income book, babdeb [Tib. འབབ་དེབ] of Taring.   

**Q:**  Did the misers have a document?   

**A:**  Yes, they had the document that showed they were taxpayer households. In the Taring's income book, all the names of the misers were also written.   

**Q:**  For the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. མི་སེར] A term that can mean serf/bound subject as well as citizen, depending on context. For example, the miser of a lord would connote the bound subjects of that lord, whereas the miser of Tibet would connote citizens of Tibet.">miser</a> themselves, did they have documents to prove the land belonged to them?   

**A:**  No, they didn't have that.   

**Q:**  If the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. མི་སེར] A term that can mean serf/bound subject as well as citizen, depending on context. For example, the miser of a lord would connote the bound subjects of that lord, whereas the miser of Tibet would connote citizens of Tibet.">miser</a> said to another miser that this land belongs to me and doesn't belong you, then what would happen?   

**A:**  We would look in the income book of Taring and it would show that this and that land belonged to such and such a person. If there was a big household [Tib. མི་ཚང་ཆེན་པོ] who had a document to prove that the land belonged to them, then this household was aristocratic and they wouldn't stay under the aristocrat. This was just like when <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. བསམ་གྲུབ་ཕོ་བྲང] The name of one of the largest and most powerful aristocratic families.">Samdru Phodrang</a>'s <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. མི་སེར] A term that can mean serf/bound subject as well as citizen, depending on context. For example, the miser of a lord would connote the bound subjects of that lord, whereas the miser of Tibet would connote citizens of Tibet.">miser</a> became aristocrats. Taring's estate was small. Taring got separated from Sikkim and came as a refugee and the Taring estate was given for their salary. When they came to Tibet as refugees, the government gave them 1,000 <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཁལ] A traditional volume measurement used for measuring grain in traditional Tibetan society. Sizes of this unit varied somewhat, but the official government khe (called mkhar ru or bstan dzin mkha ru) weighed about 28-31 pounds for barley. It was used to convey the size of fields. For example, a field said to be 10 khe in size meant that 10 khe of seed could be sown on that field.">khe</a> of grain and 1,000 khe of salt. At that time, Taring said they didn't want 1,000 khe of grain and 1,000 khe of salt, and to give them a small estate. So they gave the Taring estate. Taring estate used to be an estate of a <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. མདའ་དཔོན] A commander or general in charge of a regiment in the traditional Tibetan Army. If a regiment had only 500 troops, there was usually only one depön, but if there were 1,000 troops, there were usually two.">depön</a>. As for the depön, they had an estate as salary.   

**Q:**  When you were in Tibet, did you get the income from the estate or did you do business? Or did you manage a <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. རྫོང] A district in the traditional Tibetan governmental structure. This large administrative unit was headed by one or two district heads (tib. dzongpön [རྫོང་དཔོན]) appointed by the Tibetan government. Typically there was one lay official and one monk official who were jointly sent from Lhasa for three year terms. They were responsible for collecting taxes and adjudicating disputes in their district. These dzong were equivalent to counties (ch. 县) in the current Chinese system of administration.">dzong</a>?   

**A:**  Actually, the income was not enough [from the estate]. There were different households.   

**Q:**  For Taring, was the income from the estate enough for the expenses in Lhasa?   

**A:**  No, it was not enough. From the estate, there were only 7,000 or 8,000 <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཁལ] A traditional volume measurement used for measuring grain in traditional Tibetan society. Sizes of this unit varied somewhat, but the official government khe (called mkhar ru or bstan dzin mkha ru) weighed about 28-31 pounds for barley. It was used to convey the size of fields. For example, a field said to be 10 khe in size meant that 10 khe of seed could be sown on that field.">khe</a> of grain per year. We didn't have big animals herds. There was an estate named Doptra [Tib. རྡོ་བཀྲ] which belonged to the Tibetan Government and later they gave it to Sikkim. From that estate in a year we would get 7,000 or 8,000 khe of grain. Taring had a small estate. We received salary from the Government of Sikkim. Sikkim called my father-in-law twice to Sikkim to be the king, but he didn't go. So Sikkim was paying salary which was 6,000 English or Indian Rupees per year.   

**Q:**  Was it Indian Rupee?   

**A:**  That was the English or Indian Rupee. At the time of the Losar, from Sikkim they would send necessities like [Tib. ཐུགས་མཁོ] like rice, flour and sugar.   

**Q:**  How much did they send you?   

**A:**  They would not send much. It was two loads of rice, two loads of sugar, two loads of flour, and 4 loads of orange and 8 loads of barley beer. I remember it like it was written in the book.   

**Q:**  Those all were in good quality?   

**A:**  Yes. They would also send one load of liquor in which there were two bottles of whiskey. It depended on whether the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཕྱག་མཛོད] A senior manager/treasurer of an aristocratic or monastic estate, or the senior manager/treasurer of an aristocratic family or a monastic unit. Generally chandzö handled both internal and external issues and were considered higher in power and status than nyerpa (stewards), who typically only handled the storerooms.">chandzö</a> of the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. སྐུ་སྒེར་ཡིག་ཚང] Private Secretariat. The office of the private secretary.">Guger Yigtsang</a> of Sikkim is good or not. When the chandzö was Tseden Tashi [Tib. ཚེ་བརྟན་བཀྲ་ཤིས] and Banyag, they would send very good quality things. If the chandzö liked Taring, then he would send good quality things. If he didn't like Taring, then he would send the things which were not so good. They would also send loads of rice, 1 load of sugar, and one load of flour saying there were the necessities for the Panglhasol [Tib. པང྄་ལྷ་གསོལ]   

**Q:**  In a year were you receiving the necessities twice? Once in Losar and once in Panglhasol?   

**A:**  Yes. We also had to send necessities from Tibet to Sikkim.   

**Q:**  What kind of necessities did you have to send?   

**A:**  We had to send dry meat and tsamba.   

**Q:**  How much dry meat did you have to send?   

**A:**  We had to send two big boxes of dry meat.   

**Q:**  You had to send it at the time of Losar?   

**A:**  Yes, we had to send 2-3 loads of tsamba. From Doptra we had to send 4 loads of wool.   

**Q:**  When you were sending those needs, was it like a gift from Tibet or what?   

**A:**  It was like sending them the products from Tibet.   

**Q:**  You were sending all those things of good quality?   

**A:**  Yes, we made all with good quality. In Sikkim the children were waiting for the dry meat because they loved it.   

**Q:**  I am wondering about some family who had few estates like <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ལུང་ཤར] The family name of a famous aristocratic lay official during the time of the 13th Dalai Lama and the Regent Reting.">Lungshar</a> and <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཀ་ཤོད་པ] A famous Tibetan aristocrat who was involved in many important political intrigues.">Kapshöba</a>?   

**A:**  Yes, but <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཀ་ཤོད་པ] A famous Tibetan aristocrat who was involved in many important political intrigues.">Kapshöba</a> was quite okay.   

**Q:**  To become a kalön was very expensive so how did they do it if they didn't have money?   

**A:**  People were smart and were gambling and doing risky business. They were thinking that if they got the position of kalön then they could make more money than they spent on getting the position of kalön. So among the ministers, some of them were just doing their own things and some of them were working for the country. When the ministers were working for themselves, then the state wouldn't get developed.   

**Q:**  So did the bigger families have a bigger advantage because they had lots of money?   

**A:**  They were bigger households from the beginning and when the price of butter and grain would go up, then the big households would make lots of money. The households who didn't produce enough butter and grain, didn't have much income. We did not get enough from our estate.   

**Q:**  So what would happen to aristocrats who didn't have many estates? How could they make more money? Did they try to request to manage a <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. རྫོང] A district in the traditional Tibetan governmental structure. This large administrative unit was headed by one or two district heads (tib. dzongpön [རྫོང་དཔོན]) appointed by the Tibetan government. Typically there was one lay official and one monk official who were jointly sent from Lhasa for three year terms. They were responsible for collecting taxes and adjudicating disputes in their district. These dzong were equivalent to counties (ch. 县) in the current Chinese system of administration.">dzong</a> or an estate?   

**A:**  Regarding requesting to manage a <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. རྫོང] A district in the traditional Tibetan governmental structure. This large administrative unit was headed by one or two district heads (tib. dzongpön [རྫོང་དཔོན]) appointed by the Tibetan government. Typically there was one lay official and one monk official who were jointly sent from Lhasa for three year terms. They were responsible for collecting taxes and adjudicating disputes in their district. These dzong were equivalent to counties (ch. 县) in the current Chinese system of administration.">dzong</a> or estate [Tib. རྫོང་གཞིས], during the time of the 13th Dalai Lama, there was no way to do this unless the government appointed you. The Dalai Lama was careful about appointing persons to manage the dzong and estates. So there was not much corruption like giving bribes for getting positions. After the 13th Dalai Lama passed away, and at the time of the regents, it happened a lot. When you got the chance to manage a dzong or estate if one didn't treat the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. མི་སེར] A term that can mean serf/bound subject as well as citizen, depending on context. For example, the miser of a lord would connote the bound subjects of that lord, whereas the miser of Tibet would connote citizens of Tibet.">miser</a> well and one just worked for themselves, then the dzongpön would become rich.   

**Q:**  How did the person who manged a <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. རྫོང] A district in the traditional Tibetan governmental structure. This large administrative unit was headed by one or two district heads (tib. dzongpön [རྫོང་དཔོན]) appointed by the Tibetan government.

They were responsible for collecting taxes and adjudicating disputes in their district. These dzong were equivalent to counties (ch. 县) in the current Chinese system of administration.">dzong</a> or estate become rich? I am not clear about that. Didn't they have to deliver income to the government? Were there any limits like on how much income they would get and how much they had to spend? I think they might have had limitations.   

**A:**  From the beginning, they had a fixed amount of income. They would be told that if you go to manage that <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. རྫོང] A district in the traditional Tibetan governmental structure. This large administrative unit was headed by one or two district heads (tib. dzongpön [རྫོང་དཔོན]) appointed by the Tibetan government.

They were responsible for collecting taxes and adjudicating disputes in their district. These dzong were equivalent to counties (ch. 县) in the current Chinese system of administration.">dzong</a> there will be this much income. So the dzongpön could get a good income also and the person who managed the dzong or estate could also do business from that dzong like buying wool. If the person who managed the dzong treated the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. མི་སེར] A term that can mean serf/bound subject as well as citizen, depending on context. For example, the miser of a lord would connote the bound subjects of that lord, whereas the miser of Tibet would connote citizens of Tibet.">miser</a> nicely, then they wouldn't get much profit for themselves.   

**Q:**  Did the person who managed the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. རྫོང] A district in the traditional Tibetan governmental structure.

These dzong were equivalent to counties (ch. 县) in the current Chinese system of administration.">dzong</a> or estate have to deliver the income to the government or was there some trick or what?   

**A:**  No. There was no way to avoid to delivering the income to the government because they had to deliver it according to the income book, whether you got a good yield or not.   

**Q:**  What would happen if there was a deficit in delivering the income?   

**A:**  There would be a little deficit, but they couldn't avoid paying the income. You had to deliver the income according to a fixed amount that was set from the early times like a tax. If you had some extra income to deliver to the government, there was also competition among the persons who managed the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. རྫོང] A district in the traditional Tibetan governmental structure. This large administrative unit was headed by one or two district heads (tib. dzongpön [རྫོང་དཔོན]) appointed by the Tibetan government. Typically there was one lay official and one monk official who were jointly sent from Lhasa for three year terms. They were responsible for collecting taxes and adjudicating disputes in their district. These dzong were equivalent to counties (ch. 县) in the current Chinese system of administration.">dzong</a> or estate where they would compete about who could deliver more income to the government. If someone requested the job of managing a better dzong or estate he had to pay a lot of money to the regent or the kalön to get appointed. So he had to get back the money that he paid. This was done by making money for himself and it was not for being beneficial to the people in the dzong. Since he had his own aim to make himself rich, the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. མི་སེར] A term that can mean serf/bound subject as well as citizen, depending on context. For example, the miser of a lord would connote the bound subjects of that lord, whereas the miser of Tibet would connote citizens of Tibet.">miser</a> would suffer a lot. So there were big errors about this issue. If a person really wanted to treat the miser fairly, it was like Tsarong said: it was not okay if we didn't take care of the miser's livelihood and set up schools in the remote places. But it was difficult to do that.   

**Q:**  For example, the yield you were getting from Taring estate was not enough for you, right?   

**A:**  Yes, it was not enough.   

**Q:**  The necessities from Sikkim were also only a small amount, right?   

**A:**  Yes.   

**Q:**  The 6,000 English Rupees was for one year?   

**A:**  Yes. This money was paid to my father-in-law and mother-in-law until their death. My husband and I didn't get that 6,000 Rupees.   

**Q:**  Didn't they send anything to the children?   

**A:**  They would just send a little amount for the children. My husband got a salary from the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. བླ་ཕྱག] 1. The abbreviation of bla brang phyag mdzod, a major treasury/supply office that was located on the second floor of the Tsuglagang Temple and collected taxes annually from various parts of Tibet. 2. A monastic official/manager who worked for the Labrang of the abbots or incarnate lamas. For example, in Loseling College in Drepung, the Laja worked for the abbot who appointed him.">Laja</a> Office where he worked.   

**Q:**  What kind of salary did he get from the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. བླ་ཕྱག] 1. The abbreviation of bla brang phyag mdzod, a major treasury/supply office that was located on the second floor of the Tsuglagang Temple and collected taxes annually from various parts of Tibet. 2. A monastic official/manager who worked for the Labrang of the abbots or incarnate lamas. For example, in Loseling College in Drepung, the Laja worked for the abbot who appointed him.">Laja</a>?   

**A:**  For one year there were 12 loads of butter packed in skin bags [Tib. མར་ལྟང] and 8-9 loads of fruit and 4 loads of brick tea packed in leather. This was useful for the home expenses.   

**Q:**  Was there any other salary?   

**A:**  There was also some woolen material [Tib. སྣམ་བུ] and fruit for the New Year. The most useful was the brick tea and butter.   

**Q:**  That was also not enough, right?   

**A:**  Yes. We were also doing business.   

**Q:**  You had no choice but to do the business, right?   

**A:**  Yes. Consequently, I sent people to do business. I sent people to Sadam [Tib. ས་དམ] [in Yunnan] with 100 boxes of cigarettes and 200-300 loads of cloth.   

**Q:**  Those were things you would buy from India, right?   

**A:**  Yes. I also went to India and bought round tea bricks [Tib. བྱ་རིལ] and I sold them here. If we didn't do business, it would have been difficult because we had to send the children to school and we had to do the construction.   

**Q:**  Is it right that the big aristocrats didn't need to do business and had enough from their estates? For example, <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. བསམ་ཕོ] The abbreviated name of one of the largest and most powerful aristocratic families (Samdru Phodrang).">Sambo</a> and Thönpa [Tib. ཐོན་པ] didn't need to do business, right?   

**A:**  Their livelihoods were very good. When the price of butter and grain would go up, they would have a lot of money. Small aristocrats had to do business. Jigme la and I were doing business because Taring just had enough for his parents. I also bought about 1,000 loads of leather for making boots and 1,000 loads of round tea brick from India. That's how it was. There are still some things left to tell you about the Tsarong Sawangchemmo.   

**Q:**  Please tell us.   

**A:**  What I have to say is, where were we? <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ས་དབང་ཆེན་མོ] One of the heads of the Kashag [bka&#x27; shag] or Council of Ministers. Sawangchemmo was also a term of address for a Kalön/Shape.">Sawangchemmo</a> got demoted from the Kashag and stayed for a few year like that. Then he went to <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. གྲྭ་བཞི] 1. An area below Sera Monastery. 2. The location of the Tibetan Armory-Mint Office and the regimental headquarters of the Khadang Regiment, which was also called the Trapchi Regiment.">Trapchi</a> Office and worked very hard. In the past, the salary of the Dalai Lama's father was paid from the Trapchi Office. One day they were kind of not ready to pay that salary so the father of the Dalai Lama got angry and told Sawangchemmo, "Take your bedding with you and come here." Then he said that he should stay there [in the office]. "Why didn't you pay my salary?" Sawangchemmo told him, "We were working hard and we didn't say this only to you. I am just thinking that when the Dalai Lama is grown up, I would like to hand over a strong government to him. I didn't have any other thought." Then the Dalai Lama's father said, "You go home."   

**Q:**  One time, Taring got beaten by the Dalai Lama's father, right?   

**A:**  No, he didn't beat him. But he scolded him many times. He said, "Look at your house. Why didn't you built a good house for me?" The Dalai Lama's father went to beat Ngabö and Ngabö ran away.   

**Q:**  He held a gun and chased Ngabö, right?   

**A:**  I didn't hear about him holding the gun. The Dalai Lama's father scolded my husband many times. At that time, my husband was the official in charge of construction when they doing the construction for Yabshi. Because the new Dalai Lama had come, they had to build a house for parents of the Dalai Lama and their servants. The Dalai Lama's father was complaining that the walls and the rafters were not good. He was saying to my husband, "Look at your house. How did you build that?" He said he was sorry.   

**Q:**  You could only say, "I am sorry?"   

**A:**  Yes, you could only say "I am sorry" because he was the father of the Dalai Lama.   

**Q:**  Couldn't he tell him that after the painting was finished it would look good?   

**A:**  No, we couldn't. One day my husband got scolded by the Dalai Lama's father who said, "The size of stable is too small and don't you know that the horse will get wet when it rains?" No matter whether the Dalai Lama's father scolded people or beat them up, they had to bear it because the Dalai Lama was magnificent. And even if he beat them up, people would run away.   

**Q:**  When they gouged out <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ལུང་ཤར] The family name of a famous aristocratic lay official during the time of the 13th Dalai Lama and the Regent Reting.">Lungshar</a>'s eyeballs, <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ས་དབང་ཆེན་མོ] One of the heads of the Kashag [bka&#x27; shag] or Council of Ministers. Sawangchemmo was also a term of address for a Kalön/Shape.">Sawangchemmo</a> was not in Lhasa, right? He was at his estate, right?   

**A:**  Yes, he was not in Lhasa.   

**Q:**  Initially, when they held the meeting, was <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ས་དབང་ཆེན་མོ] One of the heads of the Kashag [bka&#x27; shag] or Council of Ministers. Sawangchemmo was also a term of address for a Kalön/Shape.">Sawangchemmo</a> at the meeting?   

**A:**  No, he was not in the meeting. When they gouged out <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ལུང་ཤར] The family name of a famous aristocratic lay official during the time of the 13th Dalai Lama and the Regent Reting.">Lungshar</a>'s eyeballs, we were very afraid.   

**Q:**  Why did you feel afraid?   

**A:**  We felt compassion for him because his eyeballs were gouged out. We were saying what would we do. At that time, I heard that they were making an agreement called, "All people agreeing on the direction that leads towards happiness." [Tib. ཀྱིཔཻ་ཆོཀླ་ཀུནཐུན [སྐྱིད་པའི་ཕྱོགས་ལ་ཀུན་མཐུན]). But we didn't go to sign the agreement.   

**Q:**  What do you mean by gengya?   

**A:**  Gengya means an agreement.   

**Q:**  What did they agree to do?   

**A:**  It said, "I agree with the issue." It was like, "Whatever you do, I will agree with you."   

**Q:**  Did somebody come to your house and ask whether or not you agreed with this?   

**A:**  It was not like that. People were saying that there was an agreement, so you should go and sign the agreement. Some people went there and signed the agreement, saying that you are doing a good job and I agree with you. So the number of people agreeing with <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ལུང་ཤར] The family name of a famous aristocratic lay official during the time of the 13th Dalai Lama and the Regent Reting.">Lungshar</a> was increasing.   

**Q:**  Where would you go [to do this]?   

**A:**  People would go to <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ལུང་ཤར] The family name of a famous aristocratic lay official during the time of the 13th Dalai Lama and the Regent Reting.">Lungshar</a>'s house. Some of the people were telling Jigme la that most of the people were going to sign the agreement, so what did he want to do? We were wondering what we should do. We didn't go there. We and Dingja [Tib. ལྡིང་ཆ] and Choktre [Tib. ལྕོག་བཀྲས] discussed going there but we didn't go.   

**Q:**  At that time, what did you think the agreement was for?   

**A:**  We just knew that the name was Kyipai Chokla Kunthun, but we didn't know the meaning. How should I say it in English?   

**Q:**  That is like a debate. In the agreement there might be the meaning?   

**A:**  It was a written agreement.   

**Q:**  They didn't know the meaning of the agreement, right?   

**A:**  Some people might have known the meaning. If you went to put your seal on the agreement paper they might have told you the meaning and you would know the meaning. If you went there and if you said that I agree with this so tell me the meaning about the agreement, then they would tell you the meaning. At that time, people who put their seal on the agreement might know the meaning. At first they did some publicizing. They would tell people what they were doing, and ask if they wanted to join. People came and looked at the agreement paper and they agreed with that. I think probably, that agreement was for changing the system in Tibet.   

**Q:**  At that time what did you think about this? Did you think if people did this, it would cause trouble for the people?   

**A:**  We didn't know what we should do, but the name of the agreement sounded very good. Anyhow, we needed a kind of reform, but we didn't know what would be the way of doing the reform. We were saying that Tsarong was not here, so there was no one we could seek advice from about that.   

**Q:**  For example, you knew the English language, right?   

**A:**  Yes.   

**Q:**  Dingja also knew English, right?   

**A:**  No, he didn't know English.   

**Q:**  Jogtre [Tib. ལྕོག་བཀྲས] also didn't know English, right?   

**A:**  Yes.   

**Q:**  But he was a person who knew things, right?   

**A:**  Yes.   

**Q:**  When you were discussing with Dingja and Joktre, what were you all saying?   

**A:**  We were saying that we heard that there was an agreement and what was in there and what shall we do? Usually, we would seek advice from <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ས་དབང་ཆེན་མོ] One of the heads of the Kashag [bka&#x27; shag] or Council of Ministers. Sawangchemmo was also a term of address for a Kalön/Shape.">Sawangchemmo</a>, but he was not here. We were talking like that. One day, people were saying that today they were going to gouge the eyeballs of Lungshar.   

**Q:**  The people thought that no matter whether the words sound nice or not, it was meant to be some kind of change, right?   

**A:**  Yes.   

**Q:**  Do you think if <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ས་དབང་ཆེན་མོ] One of the heads of the Kashag [bka&#x27; shag] or Council of Ministers. Sawangchemmo was also a term of address for a Kalön/Shape.">Sawangchemmo</a> had been in Lhasa, he would have done it?   

**A:**  I don't think he would have agreed with that. If he knew the meaning well, he might have done it. We didn't know the meaning then. <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ས་དབང་ཆེན་མོ] One of the heads of the Kashag [bka&#x27; shag] or Council of Ministers. Sawangchemmo was also a term of address for a Kalön/Shape.">Sawangchemmo</a> said that he was very lucky that he was not in Lhasa when the 13th Dalai lama passed away. He said, "If I had been here, I would have given an aspirin to the Dalai Lama when he caught a fever. Therefore, I would have been banished. I was very lucky that I got that leave."   

**Q:**  What kind of special thing did <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ས་དབང་ཆེན་མོ] One of the heads of the Kashag [bka&#x27; shag] or Council of Ministers. Sawangchemmo was also a term of address for a Kalön/Shape.">Sawangchemmo</a> do in <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. གྲྭ་བཞི] 1. An area below Sera Monastery. 2. The location of the Tibetan Armory-Mint Office and the regimental headquarters of the Khadang Regiment, which was also called the Trapchi Regiment.">Trapchi</a>? Later, he built the Trisam bridge [Tib. ཁྲི་ཟམ] and he built one bridge in <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. འབྲི་གུང] The Drigung Monastery.">Drigung</a> [Tib. འབྲི་གུང], right?   

**A:**  Yes, there was a narrow passage between the river and the mountain from Nyetang [Tib. མཉེས་ཐང] and Nam [Tib. རྣམ] so he destroyed this narrow passage [built a wider road] Before he destroyed the narrow passage, the horses and donkeys used to fall down into the river. He liked to build the road.   

**Q:**  Do you have anything else to tell us?   

**A:**  Just before the Chinese came, the Dalai Lama and the government moved to Yadong. At that time, all the aristocrats also ran away to here [India] and Tsarong was also there.   

**Q:**  You said that in Lhasa Reting the regent told <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ས་དབང་ཆེན་མོ] One of the heads of the Kashag [bka&#x27; shag] or Council of Ministers. Sawangchemmo was also a term of address for a Kalön/Shape.">Sawangchemmo</a> to be a kalön, but he didn't agree, right?   

**A:**  Yes.   

**Q:**  At that time, other people were pushing to get the kalön position so why didn't Tsarong do it? What was the reason?   

**A:**  Because he had been working as a kalön and he saw that there was nothing beneficial for the development of the country by accepting it.   

**Q:**  Did the regent send a letter or a message written on a <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. སམ་ཁྲ] The traditional rectangular wooden writing/message board. The message was written on the polished, blackened surface of the wood that was covered with a white chalk. A stylus was used to clear away the chalk leaving the shape of the letters, which appeared black. It was usually about 12-14 inches long and 2 inches wide. There was a lower board on which the messages were written and a top board which served as the cover. In many cases there were several additional writing boards between these two.">samtra</a> board?   

**A:**  He told <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ས་དབང་ཆེན་མོ] One of the heads of the Kashag [bka&#x27; shag] or Council of Ministers. Sawangchemmo was also a term of address for a Kalön/Shape.">Sawangchemmo</a> in person [unclear]. The Regent was very fond of Tsarong.   

**Q:**  I heard that the regent would come to Tsarong and stay there and swing on the swing, right?   

**A:**  Yes, <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ས་དབང་ཆེན་མོ] One of the heads of the Kashag [bka&#x27; shag] or Council of Ministers. Sawangchemmo was also a term of address for a Kalön/Shape.">Sawangchemmo</a> invited the regent and they watched movies and stayed in the garden.   

**Q:**  When was that?   

**A:**  At that time that Reting was the regent. It was in the 1940's.   

**Q:**  After <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ས་དབང་ཆེན་མོ] One of the heads of the Kashag [bka&#x27; shag] or Council of Ministers. Sawangchemmo was also a term of address for a Kalön/Shape.">Sawangchemmo</a> didn't accept the rank of kalön, who got appointed as the kalön by the regent?   

**A:**  He appointed <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. བོན་ཤོད] The name of an aristocratic family.">Bönshö</a> as the kalön. After that, the Chinese came to Tibet. <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ས་དབང་ཆེན་མོ] One of the heads of the Kashag [bka&#x27; shag] or Council of Ministers. Sawangchemmo was also a term of address for a Kalön/Shape.">Sawangchemmo</a> came back and at some point the children were also withdrawn from the school [in India]. He thought whatever would happen, we would stay here [in Lhasa] and he thought that the Chinese might treat them well. It seemed that this was the only way. At that time, the Chinese were doing things inconsistently [Tib. ཡིན་ཙམ་མིན་ཙམ]. So Dündül la, the son of Tsarong, came here, though they didn't have any thought of staying in India. Sawangchemmo gave things to the children. After that, Sawangchemmo said, "I am getting old, so I am going to invite the Dalai Lama to the Assembly at the Mönlam Chemmo." This ceremony was called Tshogpheb [Tib. ཚོགས་ཕེབས]. Sawangchemmo had the Tsarong estate which used to belong to my father and this was the estate from where he got the name. Sawangchemmo also got estates from the government for his military accomplishments. The name of the estates were Paling [Tib. དཔལ་གླིང] and Lhanga [Tib. ལྷ་ལྔ]. He also bought [took] the estate called Miru in Shang as repayment for a loan and there was an estate in Chushul. He sold all the grain from those estates and collected all the money and he also used the belongings in the house like thick brocade [Tib. རྒྱ་སེ] and whatever precious things there were when he invited the Dalai Lama for the Mönlam Chemmo in Lhasa's <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཇོ་ཁང] A most famous temple in Lhasa that houses a holy statue of the Buddha. It is often used to mean the Tsuglagang Temple of which it is a part.">Jokhang</a> temple. At that time, there were about 20,000 monks assembled together. All the holy lamas would attend the assembly and at that time, we had to offer alms, tea, and rice gruel [Tib. མིང་བཏགས] as the food.   

**Q:**  No. I think it was a thick rice porridge because you couldn't offer rice gruel. It was out of the question to serve rice gruel.   

**A:**  Oh! No, for the Tsogpheb, probably we offered the rice gruel.   

**Q:**  No, you couldn't. How could you offer it?   

**A:**  So I think we served a thick rice porridge. <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ས་དབང་ཆེན་མོ] One of the heads of the Kashag [bka&#x27; shag] or Council of Ministers. Sawangchemmo was also a term of address for a Kalön/Shape.">Sawangchemmo</a> offered all the belongings in Tsarong to the Dalai Lama. He went to get an audience with the Dalai Lama. At that time, all the grain of Tsarong were sold and the Chinese didn't get grain from Tsarong. Everything was offered to the monks. After that, my sister died. Tsarong used to treat her very well. The elder wife, Rinzin Chödrön, when she was 50 years old, she asked for leave and went back to her home <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. བདེ་ལེགས་རབ་བརྟན] The name of an important Shigatse aristocratic family.">Delerabten</a> [Tib. བདེ་ལེགས་རབ་བརྟན] in Shigatse and became a nun. When his younger wife Pema Drolker [Tib. པད་མ་སྒྲོལ་ཀར] got ill, Sawangchemmo treated her very well. After his wife died, he made very good offerings to the lamas and monks. There were many houses and he divided all the houses among his children. When he offered the alms for the monks, he also gave 500 <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. རྡོ་ཚད] A currency unit in traditional Tibet that was equal to 50 ngüsang.">dotse</a> to each of his friends and relatives like Dingja, Delerabten, and to the children and to me.   

**Q:**  Did he give the 500 <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. རྡོ་ཚད] A currency unit in traditional Tibet that was equal to 50 ngüsang.">dotse</a> at the time of Tsogpheb?   

**A:**  He gave it just after the Tsogpheb. After that, my sister died in 1957. When the uprising for Tibetan freedom took place, <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ས་དབང་ཆེན་མོ] One of the heads of the Kashag [bka&#x27; shag] or Council of Ministers. Sawangchemmo was also a term of address for a Kalön/Shape.">Sawangchemmo</a> went to join the meeting in Shöl. On the day that he went to the meeting, I met him for a short time. I think that was on the 8th when we met. He said the situation was not good. He was trying to tell me more and he asked where I went. I said, "I went to the meeting of the Women's Association and the [situation] in the meeting was not good at all." The Chinese were not doing well and the Chinese were suspicious of me. I told him like that. At that time, when the two of us were trying to talk more, they were saying Tritsab [Tib. ཀྲི་ཚབ] Rimpoche was coming, so I left. I heard that Tritsab Rimpoche didn't treat him well. Since then I didn't see him. Then they imprisoned him and later he said he was with <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. བསམ་ཕོ] The abbreviated name of one of the largest and most powerful aristocratic families (Samdru Phodrang).">Sambo</a> Depön and <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. གྲོ་མོ] The Tibetan name for the town that is located on the Sikkim/India border that the Chinese call Yadong.">Tromo</a> Geshe Rimpoche [Tib. གྲོ་མོ་དགེ་བཤེས་རིན་པོ་ཆེ]. He told me to work hard and that he didn't have any problems. They showed a movie at night and they had to work in the vegetable garden. At first, their legs were shackled. Later they [the Chinese] removed the shackles. He and Drunyichemmo Bumtang [Tib. འབུམ་ཐང] were in one cell. On the next day, they made the preparations for holding a <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཐམཛིང་ཙོནདུ (འཐབ་འཛིང་ཚོགས་འདུ); ch. 斗争会] Public accusation meetings at which the masses criticized and attacked (struggled against) class enemies and reactionaries, etcetera. Typically, the object of a struggle session would stand in front of the meeting bent over at the waist while the masses questioned and criticized, and often beat him/her.">struggle session</a> against Tsarong and beat him up. They called all of his servants. On that morning when they called him to get up, he had died. Then they called his children and his daughters like Sonam Drolma [Tib. བསོད་ནམས་སྒྲོལ་མ] and Thondrub Drolma [Tib. དོན་གྲུབ་སྒྲོལ་མ] to take his body.   

**Q:**  Do you know about <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཀ་ཤོད་པ] A famous Tibetan aristocrat who was involved in many important political intrigues.">Kapshöba</a> selling an estate to Phabongka [Tib. ཕ་བོང་ཁ]?   

**A:**  No, I don't know about it.   

**Q:**  How did they sell the estates?   

**A:**  You can sell an estate. You have to give the tenure document for the estate which shows that the estate is yours.   

**Q:**  What would they do about the taxes?   

**A:**  They had to say that the taxes would be paid by the buyer. Then the document was handed over.   

**Q:**  Was it allowed to sell the estate which was given for serving the government as an official [Tib. ཞབས་རྟེན་ཕ་གཞིས]?   

**A:**  No, you were not allowed to sell it. There were different kinds of estates and some of the branch states could be sold or bought. If an aristocrat couldn't serve the government because his estate for serving the government was too small, he could also ask for the permission to just pay money [Tib. དོད] in place of serving the government. The law on estates was kind of loose.   

**Q:**  Some of them were offering their estates to lamas, right?   

**A:**  Yes. For example Dekyiling [Tib. བདེ་སྐྱིད་གླིང] offered the estate to Radö Rimpoche [Tib. ར་སྟོད་རིན་པོ་ཆེ] and Dathang [Tib. མདའ་ཐང] also offered their estate to Kyabji Rimpoche [Tib. སྐྱབས་རྗེ་རིན་པོ་ཆེ].   

**Q:**  As for the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. མི་སེར] A term that can mean serf/bound subject as well as citizen, depending on context. For example, the miser of a lord would connote the bound subjects of that lord, whereas the miser of Tibet would connote citizens of Tibet.">miser</a>, was it the same whoever their <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. དཔོན་པོ, མངའ་བདག] 1. A manorial estate holder. 2. Chief of an area.">lord</a> was?   

**A:**  Yes. There were little differences regarding the lords. For example, some were kind to the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. མི་སེར] A term that can mean serf/bound subject as well as citizen, depending on context. For example, the miser of a lord would connote the bound subjects of that lord, whereas the miser of Tibet would connote citizens of Tibet.">miser</a> and some of them were not. When people offered the estate to a high Lama who was liked by the people, even though people want to cause problems, they wouldn't dare to do that. For example, Dathang's estate was offered to Kyabji Rimpoche and people said that was very good and they didn't dare to go against it. That's how it was. Miru Estate was also attached to Tsarong. I am not sure if it was repayment for a loan or if it was bought.   

**Q:**  People were also paying estates for loans?   

**A:**  Yes, there were things like that. If they handed over the land tenure document, then it was okay.   

**Q:**  I heard Tsarong lent a lot of loans to <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཀ་ཤོད་པ] A famous Tibetan aristocrat who was involved in many important political intrigues.">Kapshöba</a>, right?   

**A:**  I don't think so. I don't think he would give loans to <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཀ་ཤོད་པ] A famous Tibetan aristocrat who was involved in many important political intrigues.">Kapshöba</a> because Kapshöba wouldn't pay back properly.   

**Q:**  If you sold an estate to a trader, could he become a government official [Tib. གཞུང་ཞབས] or not?   

**A:**  Probably, you were not allowed to sell the estate that was your estate for serving the government. You could sell the other branch estates.   

**Q:**  If the person who bought the estate was not an aristocrat, could he buy the estate?   

**A:**  He had to pay the tax to government. You must have good documents to prove the ownership of the estate. If they didn't have good documents, then the buyer wouldn't be able to trust them. If you have the exclusive documents for a particular estate and if the conditions were complete, then one could sell it and someone could buy it. People could also give estate as a share of family property when a couple got divorced.   

**Q:**  In Lhasa, how did the price for commodities go up in the years 1920, 1930, 1940? This is the one thing. Also do you remember what social changes happened in Lhasa, like clothing? For example, regarding wearing the head ornament or <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. སྤ་ཕྲུག] The traditional woman&#x27;s headdress.">patrug</a> [Tib. སྤ་ཕྲུག] and the long false hair called lentse [Tib. ལན་རྩེ] and about men's clothing?   

**Q:**  When you first came back from Delhi in 1950, there were a lot of things changed, right?   

**A:**  Yes.   

**Q:**  Now if you look at the society in Lhasa in 1925 when you came back from India, what kind of changes occurred between 1925-1950? Maybe there were no changes, I don't know. There were changes concerning wearing the apron -- they made them shorter, right?   

**A:**  Yes, there were many social changes. When we were children, for example, the wives of the kalön and the wives of high aristocratic like Gung and Theiji, and especially the wives of the kalön, were not allowed to go out without wearing the sleeveless dress (Tib. ཏེངཙག [Tib. སྟེང་བརྩེགས])worn over the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཕྱུ་པ] The traditional Tibetan men and women&#x27;s dress. It is like a robe that is tied at the waist. Both men and women wear such dresses, although they differ slightly in color and in style.">chupa</a>, and the pearl headdress [Tib. མུ་ཏིག་སྤ་ཕུཨག].   

**Q:**  You had to wear the Tengtsag on your back?   

**A:**  Usually, the tengtsag was worn over the chupa. They would not wear the shawl, but they would wear a scarf. Wherever they would go they had to wear the pearl headdress and they had to take two male servants wearing the Mongolian <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཞྭ་མོ; ch. 戴帽] 1. A regular hat, cap. 2. A common political slang term (label) used for people who were classified as class enemies or reactionaries. It was used politically as, &quot;They put the hat on him,&quot; or &quot;They never took his hat off.&quot;">hat</a> [Tib. སོག་ཞྭ] and the maid servants also had to wear the headdress and the pendant and the turquoise earring.   

**Q:**  Was that during the time of the 13th Dalai Lama?   

**A:**  Yes, that was the time of the 13th Dalai Lama. The difficulty for all the wives of the kalön was that they had to attach long false hair to their heads. They had to wear the headdress all the time. If they didn't wear the headdress, then it would be considered inauspicious.   

**Q:**  The false hair was tied to their real hair?   

**A:**  Yes.   

**Q:**  Did they have to wear it even in bed?   

**A:**  Yes.   

**Q:**  Oh! My god!   

**A:**  That's how it was.   

**Q:**  In the bed they didn't have to wear the headdress; they could wear the false hair, right?   

**A:**  They didn't wear the headdress. They wore only the false hair. That was very hard. After that, since I was a child, the system changed. Before going to bed they could take off the false hair. In the past, the false hair was thick and heavy, but later they made the false hair a little lighter.   

**Q:**  When did that change happen?   

**A:**  The changes began in the years 1920-1922.   

**Q:**  When you went out did you have to wear the false hair?   

**A:**  Yes. You could take off the false hair when you went to bed and people were saying that that was a big change. For example, when girls became 16-17 years old and when a girl first wore the headdress, they had to celebrate it. When girls first had their hair braided, they had to put corals and turquoise on the braid and this was called tagzar [Tib. ལྟག་འཛར].   

**Q:**  What kind of celebration did they do?   

**A:**  They would serve ceremonial food made from wild sweet potato, rice, sugar, and butter tea [Tib. གྲོ་མ་འབྲས་སེལ] and they would give the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཁ་བཏགས] A Tibetan ceremonial scarf given to lamas, visitors, etc.">khata</a> scarves. This ceremony was in the house. There was a much bigger ceremony when the girl first wore the headdress at the age of 15-16. This and wearing the apron meant she became an adult. The parent had to make all the jewelry. After she wore the headdress then she would wear the apron. Some foreigners think that the apron was to distinguish between married women and unmarred women and the apron was sign of being married. That was not true. They would go on pilgrimages to the Buddha statue in Jokhang. The family also made them wear Tangtsag according to their condition.   

**Q:**  They would put on the Tangtsag?   

**A:**  Yes.   

**Q:**  They wouldn't put the pearl headdress on?   

**A:**  On that, they would make her wear all the dresses of the high rank official's wife [Tib. ལྷ་ལྕམ].   

**Q:**  Even though she was not a wife of a kalön they would make her wear the dress?   

**A:**  Yes.   

**Q:**  Did they let her wear the white boots called resom [Tib. རས་ཟོན]?   

**A:**  They didn't make them wear resom much. When the girl was sent as a bride, they would make her wear the resom. Otherwise, you could wear woolen boots (Tib. སོནཔ [ཟོན་པ]). The ceremony would be held in the protector deity's chapel [Tib. མགོན་ཁང] and the temple [Tib. མཆོད་ཁང] and all the servants would offer khata. The friends and relatives would come and give presents. On that day, whatever presents she got would be given to her. At that time, wearing the headdress was very common. After quite a while, since the headdresses were heavy, the people didn't like them and they wore them less and less, and then they stopped wearing the headdresses. Since 13th Dalai Lama passed away in 1940s [1932], it just started that lots of people didn't wear their headdresses. Until that time, all the wives of aristocratics wouldn't go out without wearing the headdress. After that, women who were wearing headdresses became fewer. However, for quite a long time, at the time of the 21 days of the Mönlam Chemmo, if you didn't wear the headdress when you went out, the two monastic officials in charge of monitoring discipline in large monasteries, the Tsogchen <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཞལ་ངོ] 1. A junior officer in the traditional Tibetan Army in charge of a unit (platoon) of 25 soldiers (same as dingpön). 2. The two head disciplinary officials for all of Drepung Monastery and for the Mönlam Prayer Festival.">Shengo</a>, would beat you no matter whether you were the wife of an aristocrat or an ordinary woman. When you went to get a blessing from the Prayer Assembly [Tib. ཚོགས་མཇལ] you had to wear the headdress and the false hair. This system lasted until 1959.   

**Q:**  Who was the first wife of an aristocrat who didn't wear the headdress?   

**A:**  I can't tell you this. It was just one woman after another who didn't wear the headdress. Especially, you were not allowed to go to <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ནོར་བུ་གླིང་ཁ] The summer palace of the Dalai Lama.">Norbulinga</a> without wearing the headdress. If you didn't wear the headdress, the guard at the gate of Norbulinga wouldn't let you in. In Norbulinga, women should wear <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཕྱུ་པ] The traditional Tibetan men and women&#x27;s dress. It is like a robe that is tied at the waist. Both men and women wear such dresses, although they differ slightly in color and in style.">chupa</a> with sleeves. If they wore the sleeveless chupa, it would be considered disrespectful. After quite a long time, women wearing the headdress became less. They didn't wear the headdress and it became fashionable to wear a pendant. And then after a while, they wore the fur <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཞྭ་མོ; ch. 戴帽] 1. A regular hat, cap. 2. A common political slang term (label) used for people who were classified as class enemies or reactionaries. It was used politically as, &quot;They put the hat on him,&quot; or &quot;They never took his hat off.&quot;">hat</a> with brocade called Tsering Kyinkhab [Tib. ཚེ་རིང་སྐྱིན་ཁབ] and the Nyangsha [Tib. མྱང་ཞྭ].   

**Q:**  Were they were wearing a <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཞྭ་མོ; ch. 戴帽] 1. A regular hat, cap. 2. A common political slang term (label) used for people who were classified as class enemies or reactionaries. It was used politically as, &quot;They put the hat on him,&quot; or &quot;They never took his hat off.&quot;">hat</a> called Tsering Kyinkhab instead of the headdress?   

**A:**  After quite a while, they wore the Tsering Kyinkhab and also a new style of <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཞྭ་མོ; ch. 戴帽] 1. A regular hat, cap. 2. A common political slang term (label) used for people who were classified as class enemies or reactionaries. It was used politically as, &quot;They put the hat on him,&quot; or &quot;They never took his hat off.&quot;">hat</a> without the outer brocade covering called Nyangsha. After that, women became more courageous and more and more wore hats.   

**Q:**  After t<a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཞྭ་མོ; ch. 戴帽] 1. A regular hat, cap. 2. A common political slang term (label) used for people who were classified as class enemies or reactionaries. It was used politically as, &quot;They put the hat on him,&quot; or &quot;They never took his hat off.&quot;">hat</a> they didn't even wear the hat, right?   

**A:**  Yes.   

**Q:**  In the past, when the wife of kalön didn't wear the headdress when they went out, would people say that she wasn't wearing the headdress?   

**A:**  Yes, it happened like that. But I am sure that the old wives of the high ranking officials wore the headdress until they died.   

**Q:**  The young women didn't wear the headdress?   

**A:**  Yes. The old women passed away and the young women acted rebellious. Then the pendant became very fashionable. They just left the headdress behind and they put on diamond pendants. But when they went to attend parties they had to wear the headdress and also the turquoise earrings [Tib. ཨས་ཀོར].   

**Q:**  Did they wear the headdress when offering the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཁ་བཏགས] A Tibetan ceremonial scarf given to lamas, visitors, etc.">khata</a> at the gathering and after that did they take off the headdress?   

**A:**  They wore the headdress at the party of the Kashag all the time. For the bigger parties, they had to wear the headdress. They definitely had to wear the headdress at government parties like the Kashag party and the lay official summer picnics called [Tib. དྲུང་སྤྱི་དབྱར་སྐྱིད]. After that, people were saying that they couldn't risk the danger because there were many thieves in town and if they wore the headdress when they came back from the party at night, the thieves would rob them. The situation in town became worse and there were more thieves. In the past, even if you went out at night wearing the headdress, no one would rob you. That's how it happened. They were wearing diamond earrings that became very popular and they paid a very high price for the turquoise earrings. The bead zi also became very fashionable.   

**Q:**  Tell me about the things that became fashionable one after another and when something became more fashionable and another thing became less fashionable?   

**A:**  After wearing headdresses became less, people wanted to wear more valuable jewelry. So those wives of aristocrats considered jewelery like investing money. After that, diamonds became fashionable and they were paying several 10,000 <a href="#" data-tooltip="[ch. 元] China&#x27;s basic currency unit. A yuan is divided into 100 fen and 10 jiao. It is also known as renminbi or &quot;people&#x27;s currency.&quot;">yuan</a> for diamond earrings and rings and pendants which became very fashionable. It changed a lot in the clothing. Earlier, they used to tie the belt low and later people tied their belt higher.   

**Q:**  First pendants became fashionable. I remember that there were differently shaped pendants like the one with eight points called shokgyema [Tib. ཤོག་བརྒྱད་མ] and there were pendants that were shaped like stars like semarango [Tib. ཟེ་མ་ར་མགོ], and there were also pendants with shapes like the moon right?   

**A:**  Yes, there were different pendants. This pendant [points] was an old style pendant. There were also pendants which came out at the middle time [Tib. བར་ཐོན]. In the past, they put turquoise on the pendant. I will show you the pendant with peach shaped turquoise designs on it. That kind of came out at the middle time. Afterward, women said that they would make fashionable pendants and then they would just make fashionable ones all the time.   

**Q:**  After that they made the star pendant, right?   

**A:**  That was kind of a false pendant. People were becoming greedy and at parties they were wearing the bigger pendants and under that they made a false pendant attached to the necklace to be used simply. Each aristocratic wife had one big pendant and several false pendants. Some of them were wearing Zi beads. They were very attentive to jewelry. Some of the wives were saying that if you had good jewelry that would be like investing money for the future. And there also were changes in the clothing worn. In the past, the sleeves of the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཕྱུ་པ] The traditional Tibetan men and women&#x27;s dress. It is like a robe that is tied at the waist. Both men and women wear such dresses, although they differ slightly in color and in style.">chupa</a> were long.   

**Q:**  When did these changes take place?   

**A:**  It kept on changing.   

**Q:**  Don't say it kept on changing. Do you remember when people were wearing long sleeves?   

**A:**  Yes, I remember that my late mother wore the long sleeves when she danced.   

**Q:**  Did you wear long sleeves?   

**A:**  No, I didn't wear long sleeves. It had changed by that time. When I was young, people were wearing narrow [Tib. ཕྲ་པོ] sleeves. Before that, they wore long sleeves.   

**Q:**  When did they wear the long sleeves?   

**A:**  Since 1921-25 people started wearing Tsering Kyingkhab hats and wearing thin sleeves.   

**Q:**  At that time, they were wearing Tsering Kyingkhab hats and narrow sleeved shirts with sleeveless <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཕྱུ་པ] The traditional Tibetan men and women&#x27;s dress. It is like a robe that is tied at the waist. Both men and women wear such dresses, although they differ slightly in color and in style.">chupa</a> [Tib. ཕུ་མེད], right?   

**A:**  Then it changed into longer sleeves.   

**Q:**  But they were still wearing Tsering Kyinkhab, right?   

**A:**  Yes.   

**Q:**  When did they start wearing Nyangsha [Tib. མྱང་ཞྭ]?   

**A:**  The Nyangzha [literally means hat of mourning] was made from brocade. A lot of people were wearing that hat.   

**Q:**  At some point weren't people wearing the Kongpo area's <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཞྭ་མོ; ch. 戴帽] 1. A regular hat, cap. 2. A common political slang term (label) used for people who were classified as class enemies or reactionaries. It was used politically as, &quot;They put the hat on him,&quot; or &quot;They never took his hat off.&quot;">hat</a> style?   

**A:**  A few people were wearing that. That's how it changed.   

**Q:**  In which year did they wear those hats?   

**A:**  The <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཞྭ་མོ; ch. 戴帽] 1. A regular hat, cap. 2. A common political slang term (label) used for people who were classified as class enemies or reactionaries. It was used politically as, &quot;They put the hat on him,&quot; or &quot;They never took his hat off.&quot;">hat</a> Tsering Kyingkhab became fashionable in the late 1920s. In the past, people tied the belt on their stomachs but later they tied their belt a little higher. For blouses. in the past they were wearing long sleeves and later it became shorter.   

**Q:**  In the 1940s, they were wearing long sleeves and from then on did it remain the same?   

**A:**  The apron also changed. In the past, the apron was said to be worn when people were working and later it became fashionable. In the past, they put small triangle decorations made of brocade on two sides of the apron (Tib. དྲོགདེན [སྒྲོག་གདན]). Later they put big drogden on the aprons which were made from thick brocade. In the past, they would wear scarves with the headdress and later people didn't wear the scarf.   

**Q:**  In the past, did they have to wear the scarf even though they wore the headdress?   

**A:**  Yes, when you wore the headdress, you had to take the scarf with you. Nowadays, the Bhutanese are wearing the scarf.   

**Q:**  Was that because you might feel cold?   

**A:**  They must take the scarf. The wife of Phunkhang always had the scarf with her. In <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ནོར་བུ་གླིང་ཁ] The summer palace of the Dalai Lama.">Norbulinga</a> you were not allowed to use an umbrella, so in the sunshine you could use the scarf as an umbrella.   

**Q:**  When did people stop wearing scarves?   

**A:**  It has been a long time since people have worn scarves, although they had to wear scarves in big ceremonies. When you went as a bride you had to wear a scarf and shawl.   

**Q:**  When did they stop wearing the shawl?   

**A:**  They didn't stop wearing shawls.   

**Q:**  They would wear the shawl in big ceremonies, but not every day, right?   

**A:**  Even though they didn't wear the shawl every day, they had to wear the shawl in big ceremonies and at weddings. At the big parties, the women who served the barley beer [Tib. འཁྲུངས་ཞུ་མ] had to wear scarves and the jewelry ornaments and shawl. That system was carried on even after the Chinese came to Tibet. When we were having the lay official's summer picnic [Tib. དྲུང་སྤྱི་དབྱར་སྐིད] people were wearing all the jewelry. This system was carried on until the Tibetan uprising. Usually there were more women who they didn't wear the headdress, but the main system of wearing the jewelry was continued until the Tibetan uprising.   

**Q:**  Was there any change regarding the age at marriage?   

**A:**  No. That didn't change in Tibet. In the past, in some cases they were getting married at a young age, like 14-15. But most people would send the bride at the age of 17 or 18, which was the right time. They didn't arrange the marriage at the age of 11 or 12 like in India. In some cases there was am arranged marriage system. For example, if you had a baby girl and if I had a boy, we would say that in the future our son and your daughter will get married. It happened like that, you know the wife of Wangdü La [Tib. དབང་འདུས་ལགས] and my elder sister from <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. བདེ་ལེགས་རབ་བརྟན] The name of an important Shigatse aristocratic family.">Delerabten</a> were friends. They said that in the future if you give a birth to a baby boy and if I give birth to a baby girl then we will arrange their marriage. After that, they had a very hard time and it didn't go well. It happened like that because of one's Karmic effect. Regarding men, they also changed the style of their head knot (Tib. <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. སྤ་ལྗོག] The two hair knots required to be worn by Tibetan government officials on their heads.">pajok</a> [སྤ་ལྕོག]).   

**Q:**  How did that change?   

**A:**  In the past, the style of head knots was like this. Later they made the head knot up like false hair.   

**Q:**  I guess that's all?   

**A:**  Yes. The people who usually wore the Tsechuma [Tib. ཚལ་ཕྱུ་མ] used to have their belt tied high and in the past it was tied lower. The sleeves also used to be broader, but later they became narrower.   

**Q:**  Would they wear the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཕྱུ་པ] The traditional Tibetan men and women&#x27;s dress. It is like a robe that is tied at the waist. Both men and women wear such dresses, although they differ slightly in color and in style.">chupa</a> Tsechuma in the past?   

**A:**  In the past the sleeve of a <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཕྱུ་པ] The traditional Tibetan men and women&#x27;s dress. It is like a robe that is tied at the waist. Both men and women wear such dresses, although they differ slightly in color and in style.">chupa</a> was very big. The people who usually wear the kind of chupa called Chubchen [Tib. ཕྱུ་ཆེན] would put the belt low. The men's chupa also changed and they tied their belts higher and they made their sleeves shorter like women's.   

**Q:**  Were they wearing the Tsechuma from long ago?   

**A:**  I was told that they were wearing Tsechuma in early times under their chupas. They were wearing the Tsechuma at the time of my father. That's how it was. Tibetan social laws were very strict.   

**Q:**  In the past they were talking about whether you could wear leather shoes, right?   

**A:**  You were not allowed to wear leather shoes and use the Indian saddle. If you put on an Indian saddle, they would rob it. Basically, Tibetan law has been strict. If women wore yellow and orange clothing, they would scold you and say that yellow and orange were the colors of monks and not the colors of women. At some point, they were doing some meaningless things like that.   

**Q:**  Were there any changes in economics, e.g., price of the things?   

**A:**  Yes, there were many changes. For example, since I can remember, in 1925 or in 1926, the price of one square of brocade was 1-2-3 sang. However, before we left Lhasa [for exile] the price of brocade had gone up to 250 srang which was equal to 5 dotse. In 1925, one Bo [Tib. འབོ] of barley was 1 srang.   

**Q:**  The price went up from 1 <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. སྲང] A unit of traditional Tibetan currency. It was also called ngüsang [tib. དངུལ་སྲང]. 50 nügsang = 1 dotse; 10 sho = 1 nügsang; 20 5-karma coins = 1 ngüsang. There were also paper currency notes of 7-sang, 25-sang, and 10-sang denominations.">sang</a>. Since I can remember, the price of one Bo of barley was 7 sang and 5 sho. That stayed for quite a long time, right?   

**A:**  Later, the price of barley went up to 25 sang. After that it went up to 50 sang. At that time the big households were saying that we should hold the barley until the price went up to 100 sang. Then we should repay the loans.   

**Q:**  Did the price of barley go up to 100 <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. སྲང] A unit of traditional Tibetan currency. It was also called ngüsang [tib. དངུལ་སྲང]. 50 nügsang = 1 dotse; 10 sho = 1 nügsang; 20 5-karma coins = 1 ngüsang. There were also paper currency notes of 7-sang, 25-sang, and 10-sang denominations.">sang</a>?   

**A:**  Yes. Later the price of barley went up to 250 sang. Butter and meat were also expensive.   

**Q:**  When did the big changes in price take place? Did it happen gradually or did the price go up rapidly after the 1940s?   

**A:**  The price went up rapidly for most things after the Chinese came. Before that the price increased only gradually.   

**Q:**  You remember the price of barley went up from 5 <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཞོ] A unit in the traditional Tibetan currency system. 10 sho equaled to 1 sang and 10 karma equaled one sho.">sho</a> to 1 <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. སྲང] A unit of traditional Tibetan currency. It was also called ngüsang [tib. དངུལ་སྲང]. 50 nügsang = 1 dotse; 10 sho = 1 nügsang; 20 5-karma coins = 1 ngüsang. There were also paper currency notes of 7-sang, 25-sang, and 10-sang denominations.">sang</a>. I remember that in 1945-1946, when I was 6-7 years old, the price of barley was 7 sang and 5 sho. During the time of the regent <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. སྟག་བྲག] The regent of Tibet who replaced Reting in 1941 and served until 1950 when the 14th Dalai Lama assumed power.">Taktra</a> [Tib. སྟག་བྲག], prices went up very high, right?   

**A:**  People were saying that at the time of the regent Reting the economic condition [Tib. སྐྱ་ནམ] was quite good. Anyway, prices gradually increased. The cause of the inflation was because the government was just printing more money.   

**Q:**  How did they print more money? Did they print more paper currency?   

**A:**  They printed many kinds of paper currency so there was more money [in circulation] and prices went up. In the past, in Lhasa, one maund of sugar cost 50 Indian rupees [Tib. སྒོར་མོ].   

**Q:**  Was 50 <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. སྲང] A unit of traditional Tibetan currency. It was also called ngüsang [tib. དངུལ་སྲང]. 50 nügsang = 1 dotse; 10 sho = 1 nügsang; 20 5-karma coins = 1 ngüsang. There were also paper currency notes of 7-sang, 25-sang, and 10-sang denominations.">sang</a> considered expensive?   

**A:**  Yes. That was very expensive. Just after we came back from school in India, at that time, 1 Indian rupee was not even worth one <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. སྲང] A unit of traditional Tibetan currency. It was also called ngüsang [tib. དངུལ་སྲང]. 50 nügsang = 1 dotse; 10 sho = 1 nügsang; 20 5-karma coins = 1 ngüsang. There were also paper currency notes of 7-sang, 25-sang, and 10-sang denominations.">sang</a>; it was 7 sho. Later, one rupee was worth 15 sang. In 1925, one Indian rupee was not even one sang.   

**Q:**  At some point, one Indian rupee was worth 5 <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. སྲང] A unit of traditional Tibetan currency. It was also called ngüsang [tib. དངུལ་སྲང]. 50 nügsang = 1 dotse; 10 sho = 1 nügsang; 20 5-karma coins = 1 ngüsang. There were also paper currency notes of 7-sang, 25-sang, and 10-sang denominations.">sang</a> and it remained that way for long time, right?   

**A:**  It remained that way for a long time. Later it went up to 15 <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. སྲང] A unit of traditional Tibetan currency. It was also called ngüsang [tib. དངུལ་སྲང]. 50 nügsang = 1 dotse; 10 sho = 1 nügsang; 20 5-karma coins = 1 ngüsang. There were also paper currency notes of 7-sang, 25-sang, and 10-sang denominations.">sang</a> for one Indian rupee.   

**Q:**  At that time, a <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ད་ཡང; ch. 大洋] A Chinese silver dollar that had the image of Yuan Shikai on its face. It was used by the Chinese government in Tibet in the 1950s because Tibetans did not accept Chinese paper currency.">dayan</a> was also worth 15 <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. སྲང] A unit of traditional Tibetan currency.

**A:**  Yes. One <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ད་ཡང; ch. 大洋] A Chinese silver dollar that had the image of Yuan Shikai on its face. It was used by the Chinese government in Tibet in the 1950s because Tibetans did not accept Chinese paper currency.">dayan</a> was equal to 3 rupees.   

**Q:**  So it was 5 <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. སྲང] A unit of traditional Tibetan currency. It was also called ngüsang [tib. དངུལ་སྲང]. 50 nügsang = 1 dotse; 10 sho = 1 nügsang; 20 5-karma coins = 1 ngüsang. There were also paper currency notes of 7-sang, 25-sang, and 10-sang denominations.">sang</a> for one rupee, right?   

**A:**  I think it went up more than that. The price of grain and Indian cloth also increased. But at that time all the people had abundant money. The price of things increased because people had an abundance of money. This is my opinion. I think that if they say that if people's stomachs became large, then it is too bad and one won't be able to fill it. If we say the price of things went up, it seems like people were having abundant money. If your salary increased, then when you bought things, it would become easier. If they sold you things that you needed like fruit and cloth and they charged more, you also had more to pay. So it just depended on how abundant your money was. For example, if they said that the crop grew less this year than last year, e.g., if they said that last year they got yields 5-10 times the seed sown, and this year it was only 3-4 times a yield, then we won't have enough food to eat, so we would be finished. Paying more paper currency to each other just became extra work. That's all. This is my own opinion. I think about a lot of things. For example, when we plant barley, if we plant one grain and at the time of harvest the yield becomes 10 grains, this is precious. For one grain of barley there would be one ear of stalk and there would be many grains in that. If the ear of a stalk grain got worse, then it was finished. Some people were saying that in the past the grains of barley were big like this and now they have became smaller. In our generation, the grain didn't become smaller. The size of people's stomach was same as before. What happened is that the money became abundant and I think the price of things remained same as before. I have always had this kind of thought. It is too bad if they say the yield was getting worse and the cow wasn't giving much milk. If you had money, you would get milk. Everywhere, money became abundant. In Tibet, they printed many 100 <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. སྲང] A unit of traditional Tibetan currency. It was also called ngüsang [tib. དངུལ་སྲང]. 50 nügsang = 1 dotse; 10 sho = 1 nügsang; 20 5-karma coins = 1 ngüsang. There were also paper currency notes of 7-sang, 25-sang, and 10-sang denominations.">sang</a> notes. I was told by Tsarong that if the government didn't have much reserve then there would be a great trouble so he stored much gold and Chinese silver. Later, the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. གྲྭ་བཞི] 1. An area below Sera Monastery. 2. The location of the Tibetan Armory-Mint Office and the regimental headquarters of the Khadang Regiment, which was also called the Trapchi Regiment.">Trapchi</a> office bought gold and silver and the government had quite a good store of gold and silver. The way of Tsarong's work in the past, in the middle period, and at present were all good. Money became abundant. That's how it happened. At that time, a cause of the people's livelihood improving was that the Sikkim Political Officer Mr Guru came and his way of thinking was nice. He said, "The aristocrats of Tibet should become rich. If the aristocrats become rich then they will treat their <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. མི་སེར] A term that can mean serf/bound subject as well as citizen, depending on context. For example, the miser of a lord would connote the bound subjects of that lord, whereas the miser of Tibet would connote citizens of Tibet.">miser</a> well." So he gave many licenses to the aristocrats to buy Chinese silver so at that time much Chinese silver came to Tibet. Each license for buying silver bricks could get one lakh of Indian rupees as profit. As for us, he gave us a license to buy 200 silver bricks. We sold that and we [used the profit] to built the Taring House in Lhasa. [... unclear] He gave many licenses to Surkhang and Tsarong. The silver bricks helped a lot of people to get rich.   

**Q:**  Did they give the licenses to private people?   

**A:**  Yes. Guru Sab came to Tibet three times.   

**Q:**  At that time, did the British give parties for the children?   

**A:**  Yes. They gave many parties for the children.   

**Q:**  At that time were you there?   

**A:**  I was the one of main members at the parties.   

**Q:**  When they gave the party for the wives of aristocrats, I heard that you got there late and were unable to join the party because you were working on construction. Is that right?   

**A:**  Guru Sab used to give a Christmas Party for the children. At that time, the wife of Ringang [Tib. རིན་སྒང] and I had to go to help at the party doing things like giving the presents to the children. Guru Sab used to bring very good quality toys. He liked to treat the children well. He invited Dromo Geshe Rimpoche [Tib. གྲོ་མོ་དགེ་བཤེས་རིན་པོ་ཆེ], who was a very young boy then. At that time, he was 5 years old. When he came to the party, the servant of Rimpoche went to seek a blessing from him. At that time, Guru Sab said, "Why did they treat him like that? [... unclear]   

**Q:**  Probably, he didn't believe in Geshe Rimpoche?   

**A:**  No. It was not that he didn't have faith, but it was because he was a just a child.   

**Q:**  At that time, people in Kalimpong had great faith towards Geshe Rimpoche. The former Geshe Rimpoche was very well known. The children of Guru sab had very good toys.   

**Q:**  Why did he like to buy good quality toys? At that time, did he buy the toys or was it the government?   

**A:**  The government bought the toys, but there was a great diffidence in the way people worked. He was powerful and whatever he did, he like to do on a large scale. Guru sab was different from the other Political Officers of Sikkim.   

**Q:**  Do you have the book called "Lotus and Jewelry" which was written by Guru sab?   

**A:**  Yes, I have that.   

**Q:**  Can I borrow that book?   

**A:**  Sure. That was published after he died.   

**Q:**  Please lend me the book written by Künsangtse [Tib. ཀུན་བཟང་རྩེ].   

**A:**  Sure. I will send the book. If you read his book then you will know that no matter whatever aim he had, he wanted to set up good relations with Tibetans. He thought that if he helped the aristocrats and they became rich, then they would treat the misers well.   

**Q:**  The main thing he did was to give licenses to the aristocrats so they could do business, right?   

**A:**  Yes.   

**Q:**  He also gave the licenses to Lamas, so why was that?   

**A:**  I think it was the same. If a <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. བླ་བྲང] 1. The property/wealth owning corporate entity of an incarnate lama. 2. The property/wealth owning corporate entity of the Panchen Lama.">labrang</a> requested a license he would give it. And any important person who requested one he would give it.   

**Q:**  When did he give these licenses?   

**A:**  It was 1937-1938. I remember that very clearly because I was building the Taring House. The main expenditure for that was paid by the 200 silver bricks.   

**Q:**  Were there any changes after the 13th Dalai Lama died?   

**A:**  The 13th Dalai Lama prohibited smoking. He sent an edict to all the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. རྫོང] A district in the traditional Tibetan governmental structure. This large administrative unit was headed by one or two district heads (tib. dzongpön [རྫོང་དཔོན]) appointed by the Tibetan government. Typically there was one lay official and one monk official who were jointly sent from Lhasa for three year terms. They were responsible for collecting taxes and adjudicating disputes in their district. These dzong were equivalent to counties (ch. 县) in the current Chinese system of administration.">dzong</a> and the estates.   

**Q:**  What happened in Gyantse Dzong?   

**A:**  The Gyantse Dzong sent an edict to the masses. There was a clerk and he said, "Now the persons who are using opium and cigarettes are sending the edict to those people who aren't using opium and cigarettes." Since the 13th Dalai Lama passed away, those prohibitions were gradually disbanded. All the people had great faith toward the Dalai Lama and he treated the people like parents do their children. So all people didn't think that he was a harsh person. In those days, nobody could handle Tibet. All the people were afraid of him and also they were happy. The discipline was very good. After the 13th Dalai Lama passed away, the corruption increased which was not good for the country. When there was good discipline, it was good for the country. During the time of the regent <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. སྟག་བྲག] The regent of Tibet who replaced Reting in 1941 and served until 1950 when the 14th Dalai Lama assumed power.">Taktra</a>, mahjong was prohibited and all the mahjong sets were burned.   

**Q:**  It was said widely that Ngabö lost his property/ house and his wife at mahjong, right?   

**A:**  I don't know about that. Anyhow, when the aristocrats played mahjong, there were great losses and great winnings. So they asked their partners to join the office and they were not attentive to government work and the work was delayed. But the 13th Dalai Lama's government offices were successful [Tib. ཚགས་ཚུད་པོ].   

**Q:**  Do you think there was a difference a generation ago during the period from 1930-1940? There are lot of aristocrats and traders doing a lot of trade, but a generation ago, like the time of your parents, among the aristocratic were they doing less trade?   

**A:**  At the time of my parents, they were really aristocrats and they didn't do trade. Trade had become more popular in our generation among the aristocrats. At the time of my parents, they were using the income they got from their estates only for their expenditures. They didn't do trading. If they had a hard time for their livelihood, they would take loans and some households had many loans. We didn't have large estates, so my parents had some loans to pay. After that Dasang Dramdrü paid all the loans.   

**Q:**  When did aristocrats start doing business?   

**A:**  The aristocrats started doing business in the 1930s. At the time of the Second World War, they developed a road and since then many cigarettes and yards of cloth were sent to China. There were many traders from Yunnan. Since then, people started doing trade. The aristocrats and the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. བླ་བྲང] 1. The property/wealth owning corporate entity of an incarnate lama. 2. The property/wealth owning corporate entity of the Panchen Lama.">labrang</a> were doing trade and the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཕྱག་མཛོད] A senior manager/treasurer of an aristocratic or monastic estate, or the senior manager/treasurer of an aristocratic family or a monastic unit. Generally chandzö handled both internal and external issues and were considered higher in power and status than nyerpa (stewards), who typically only handled the storerooms.">chandzö</a> of the labrang were also doing trade. They made very good profit.   

**Q:**  Did they mainly sell Indian goods?   

**A:**  They sent dark blue jean material to China for making army uniforms. At that time, if a motorable road would have been opened, it would have been very good. But the [Tibetan Government] didn't let the road open. In the past, the British sent a jeep for delivering the mail from Phari to Gyantse. But the people of Gyantse were against that and were saying, "If you send up jeeps, you will stop us from making profit from transportation goods by donkey and it will harm the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. མི་སེར] A term that can mean serf/bound subject as well as citizen, depending on context. For example, the miser of a lord would connote the bound subjects of that lord, whereas the miser of Tibet would connote citizens of Tibet.">miser</a> livelihood." So they reported this to the government and they stopped the jeeps. They were stopping vehicles and I don't know whether that helped or caused harm. But they had to transport the trade goods using horses, yaks, and mules.   

**Q:**  What about the family life? There were different changes on economy and people were buying more things. Were there any changes in the relationship between people?   

**A:**  No. The relationships between people remained as same as before. In some households, they had unfortunate things happen. Anyhow, the people's livelihood was developing and it didn't get worse. The people of Tibet love to eat good food.   

**Q:**  In some countries like America, things changed and the children didn't listen to their parents and the wives got more power. Did anything like this happen in Tibet?   

**A:**  No, it didn't happen like that. It remained the same as before. The children had great affection towards their parents. In the households, the elder people will act like elderly and the wife had the power inside the house. All of these didn't have much change, but some of the households had change. That was just a natural thing. The majority of people were good. Since people begin to do trading, the people's livelihood got better and they had good furniture. Therefore, Tibet was developing. Even a small household improved. <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཀ་ཤོད་པ] A famous Tibetan aristocrat who was involved in many important political intrigues.">Kapshöba</a> was nothing in the past, but later he became very good in economics. The aristocratic households got much better and even their cushions were made much better. People were getting much more fashionable.   

**Q:**  Did they become much more fashionable after the 13th Dalai Lama died?   

**A:**  Yes, I think it was like that. When the Dalai Lama was alive, people were afraid of getting scolded by the Dalai Lama if they did fashionable things. After the 13th Dalai Lama passed away, nobody was saying that they were happy that the Dalai Lama passed away, but naturally people didn't need to be afraid of him. So life became more elaborate.   

**Q:**  Did aristocrats go to the restaurants?   

**A:**  We regarded the people who would go to restaurants and teashops as pitiful and bad. There weren't any good restaurants that the aristocrats could go to. If you went to the restaurants and the teashops, people might think you didn't have a good living condition at home so you went to the restaurant to eat.   

**Q:**  There was a song about this t<a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཞྭ་མོ; ch. 戴帽] 1. A regular hat, cap. 2. A common political slang term (label) used for people who were classified as class enemies or reactionaries. It was used politically as, &quot;They put the hat on him,&quot; or &quot;They never took his hat off.&quot;">hat</a> said, "If people eat bread it means they don't have tsamba. If people wear the hat Tsering Kyinkhab, it means they don't have a headdress." [Tib. བཞེས་བག་ཀོ་ཀུན་མཆོད་མཁན། གསོལ་ཞིབ་མེད་པའི་རྟགས་རེད། ཚེརིང་སྐྱིན་ཁབ་མཆོད་མཁན། དབུ་ཕྲུག་མེད་པའི་རྟགས་རེད].   

**A:**  That's true. People were singing like that.   

**Q:**  How about gambling? You mentioned mahjong. Did gambling become more popular after the 13th Dalai Lama died?   

**A:**  Yes, of course. It became very popular and it was like limitless.   

**Q:**  When did they start gambling? Was it 5-6 years after [the Dalai Lama died]?   

**A:**  It started gradually.   

**Q:**  Later, when people were gambling, did they use gold coins to gamble?   

**A:**  People wouldn't go to play mahjong if they didn't have 5-6 tola of gold in their pockets.   

**Q:**  It looks to me like a little bit that after the 13th Dalai Lama died, people were more interested in getting goods and buying things and having fun and gambling and fooling around. At that time, did they think about the government?   

**A:**  I think that if someone worked sincerely and energetically for the government, that person himself wouldn't be successful and he would have some hindrances. So people were saying that it would be okay if you do just the regular government work and people lost their interest in that. If you really wanted to develop the country, they would say that you were a spy from this and that and they would teach you a lesson. People were saying that the Prime Minister Desi Sangye Gyatso [Tib. སྡེ་སྲིད་སངས་རྒྱས་རྒྱ་མཚོ] did many things for developing Tibet, so what happened to him? People were saying that if someone worked diligently for the government, they wouldn't get a good result and there would be many people who didn't like them. When we think about that, the reason why people thought like that was because of the poor education and shortsightedness. The main reason was the lack of education. If people were educated, all the people would have thoughts in unison on developing the country. We were lacking good schools. So the public were thinking that whatever things are related to the government, the government would know about it. They had great trust in the government. But the lords [Tib. སྐུ་ངོ] of the Tibetan Government were playing mahjong, so what would happen?   

**Q:**  You are absolutely right.   

**A:**  The Tibetan people trusted the government, but they [the officials] were doing like that. So we lost Tibet to the Chinese. If they had done well, it wouldn't have been so easy for the Chinese.   

**Q:**  After the Dalai Lama died, there were two people who were most likely to keep changes going; <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཀུན་འཕེལ] The name of the favorite of the 13th Dalai Lama who became politically powerful during the later period of the 13th Dalai Lama&#x27;s reign.">Künphel</a> la and <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ལུང་ཤར] The family name of a famous aristocratic lay official during the time of the 13th Dalai Lama and the Regent Reting.">Lungshar</a>, right?   

**A:**  Yes.   

**Q:**  After 1934, nobody came forward and the government work was just done at the minimum [Tib. འཆར་ཅན]?   

**A:**  Yes, government work became not special.   

**Q:**  That's why I want to go back to Tsarong's period. It was very important in making changes, right?   

**A:**  At that time he did very well. Because Tsarong had the power and the Dalai Lama supported him, he was successful during the 14 years before he went to India for pilgrimage. After that, people instigated and he got demoted. People were saying that if someone worked sincerely for the government, then that person wouldn't be successful. The same thing happened to <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ལུང་ཤར] The family name of a famous aristocratic lay official during the time of the 13th Dalai Lama and the Regent Reting.">Lungshar</a>, <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཀུན་འཕེལ] The name of the favorite of the 13th Dalai Lama who became politically powerful during the later period of the 13th Dalai Lama&#x27;s reign.">Künphel</a> la, and Tsarong because they were faithful to the government [Tib. གཞུང་སེམས་ཆེན་པོ].   

**Q:**  They were mostly liberal in term of change?   

**A:**  They had been very powerful.   

**Q:**  Was Trimon [Tib. ཁྲི་སྨོན] very conservative?   

**A:**  You have judged quite well. Trimon had a high rank, but there was no record that he did anything helpful to the government.   

**Q:**  It was very difficult to change Tibet because most changes meant that monks in the monastery would have less power and as soon as they realized that, they would stop it. It was very difficult, right?   

**A:**  To have a change, first the people should know what the change would be. Otherwise, how could it work? If people didn't have knowledge concerning the benefit of a change and they might have to live like that [it is had]... I heard that when somebody told <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. གླང་མདུན] The name of the family of the 13th Dalai Lama.">Langdün</a>, who was then a kalön, that a plane would come to Tibet he said, "Planes cannot come to Tibet because in Tibet there are many high mountains which will block the plane." Some of them were saying that if we brought electricity into the country then the weather would get warmer. The people needed education and also the leaders also needed education.   

**Q:**  Once when they said that they were going to set up electricity in <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཀུན་བདེ་གླིང] 1. A famous incarnate lama whose lineage served as Regent of Tibet. The Lhasa monastery of Kundeling Rimpoche.">Kundeling</a> Labrang, the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. རྫ་ས] 1. A high rank in the Tibetan government. 2. A top manager-like official for the labrang of important incarnate lamas, especially those who in the past had served as regents of Tibet.">dzasa</a> said, "If you set up electricity, our houses will burn down."   

**Q:**  Do you know how old Prime Minister <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. གླང་མདུན] The name of the family of the 13th Dalai Lama.">Langdün</a> was when he died?   

**A:**  Yes, I know. <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. གླང་མདུན] The name of the family of the 13th Dalai Lama.">Langdün</a> was two years older than me. Just after they gouged the eyeballs of <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ལུང་ཤར] The family name of a famous aristocratic lay official during the time of the 13th Dalai Lama and the Regent Reting.">Lungshar</a>, Langdün resigned.   

**Q:**  I think that was in 1938, right?   

**A:**  When they gouged the eyeballs of <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ལུང་ཤར] The family name of a famous aristocratic lay official during the time of the 13th Dalai Lama and the Regent Reting.">Lungshar</a>, <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. གླང་མདུན] The name of the family of the 13th Dalai Lama.">Langdün</a> was there and he signed the verdict.   

**Q:**  1938 was the Earth Tiger Year. At that time, how old was <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. གླང་མདུན] The name of the family of the 13th Dalai Lama.">Langdün</a>? What animal year were you born in?   

**A:**  I was born in the Bird Year so I am 73 years old.   

**Q:**  So it was 45 years ago.   

**A:**  <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. གླང་མདུན] The name of the family of the 13th Dalai Lama.">Langdün</a> is 2 years older than me.   

**Q:**  So he might have been about 30 years old. He became the Prime minister in 1926.   

**A:**  I heard that he wasn't educated.   

**Q:**  From the Western point of view, after the Dalai Lama died, he was the one should have had the power?   

**A:**  Yes. Everybody says that he was a foolish person. He died recently. I think it was just two or three years go. He was a sweet man, but probably he didn't know how to think about work. After threshing was over and when they brought the grain home, the grain was kind of wet. When they measured the grain [in the bo], the number [of bo] would be high. After storing the grain in the storeroom, it would dry up.
