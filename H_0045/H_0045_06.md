**A:**  The number of miser depended on the size of the
               estate. Some of them had about 15-20 miser (families). Those aristocrats who had big
               estates had about 100 miser. The miser also had land according to the size of the
               estate. The miser had to work providing ula for the aristocrat because they held land
               [from the estate]. When the miser came to work for ula, they were sent to plant the
               fields or do the other farming tasks. They [the lords] would give them a little food.
               That was the tax on the miser.   

**Q:**  I don't understand about the land-basis [Tib.
               rten] the miser had for providing ula?   

**A:**  Yes, miser had a land-basis for doing ula.   

**Q:**  It is hard for you to talk about aristocrats in
               general because there were different systems. According to the system at Tsarong
               [Tib. tsharong] and Taring [Tib. phreng ring], for example, say one household had two
               sons and a father, and the elder son and father were getting along, but the younger
               son didn't get along well. Then if the two brothers took one bride and the younger
               son and the bride didn't get along with each other, and the younger son says that I
               can't live with my father and my brother and am going to separated, since that miser
               family had land, in this case would they be able to divide the land or not? If they
               could, how would they do that? Did they have to report it to the lord? What was the
               traditional custom for that? I am confused.   

**A:**  We had the same custom among the miser and also
               among the aristocrats. What you were saying is if there was the father and two sons
               and the younger son says he wants to get separated, then they would give a share to
               the younger son. If they agree to that, they didn't have to file the law case to the
               court. If they didn't agree to that, they could also file the case to court. Usually,
               the younger son would request them to give him a good share. If the older son
               
  

**Q:**  Usually, they would give only money and things,
               not land, right?   

**A:**  Yes. If they had a large amount of land they
               would also give land and if they didn't have a large area of land then they wouldn't
               give the land. For example, in an aristocratic household like Taring's, if the
               brothers didn't get along, they would divide the estate and the best estate would be
               kept by the older brother and other smaller estates could be divided. You don't have
               to report it to the government. If you are not satisfied in the division of the
               estates, then you could report it to the government. If the government supported him
               and said the share that was given was too little, you had to give more as the share.
               Then you had to obey to the government order. As for the Taring
               family's miser, it was also the same. If they didn't get along among the brothers,
               then they would tell us and we would be completely fair and we would say that you
               should give more share to the younger brother. Otherwise they could also divide the
               land among themselves.   

**Q:**  Among the misers, were they allowed to sell the
               land to each other?   

**A:**  They could buy the land, and if they bought the
               land they also had to divide the tax which was levied on the land. They were obliged
               to pay or work for the tax according to the [size of the] land.   

**Q:**  If a Taring miser would sell one tregang to
               another miser, did he have to report this to Taring, saying that "I am going to sell
               the land and he will be obliged to work for the tax"?   

**A:**  Yes, they had to tell Taring that they decided to
               do that.   

**Q:**  When they reported to the Taring, would Taring
               have any objection to that?   

**A:**  No. If they agreed to do that then we wouldn't
               have any objection to that. If they said that my father was not truthful and the
               father might say that no matter how much I gave him he still was not satisfied, we
               would say to the son, "Don't do this, your father has only this much [land]." If they
               didn't listen to us, they could also appeal the case to the dzong.
               There was a good thing in the Tibetan tradition. If a couple divorces or if they give
               the estate to each other, no matter whether the case was big or small, if you could
               make an agreement internally, they wouldn't go to the court. After making the
               agreement, the document of your estate which was issued by the government would be
               the main basis. Supposing if someone said "I will give the Taring
               [estate] to another person," then he had to give the document of the Taring's estate
               to the other person. Otherwise, the Taring estate wouldn't belong to that person. If
               a couple got divorced and if they gave a share, then you wouldn't have to report it
               to the government. If the case became bitter, then you had to report it to the
                  government. If you did that, you had to spend lot of money and
               it was very hard because you had to tell many people. If they made an agreement among
               themselves, that would be very good. You could also give the estate to your father
               and the father could also give an estate to his son. The only thing you had to do was
               to make a good agreement and you needed to have one witness. In the document, for the
               headline, you would write, "To the political and temporal master of the law [Tib.
               lugs gnyis gong ma khrim bdag rin po che]" and at the end they would write, "If we
               don't get along then we will accept whatever the government orders or whatever the
               punishment." That was a very important agreement. You could make the decision by
               yourself. It was strange.   

**Q:**  In Tibet the younger son had fewer rights, right?   

**A:**  If there were two sons, the elder son had more
               rights than the younger one. If there was a son and a daughter then the son had more
               right than the girl. Among the daughters the elder daughter had more rights.   

**Q:**  Supposing the boy belonged to another lord like
               Rimpoche and the girl belonged to Taring, then what would happen?   

**A:**  If the boy was a miser of Rimpoche, then he would
               pay mibo to Rimpoche and the girl would pay mibo to us. It was like if I was an
               aristocrat and if I took a bride for my son from one of Rimpoche's miser, I had to
               ask for permission [Tib. mi 'krol] from Rimpoche.   

**Q:**  You mean to say that if the boy and the girl were
               aristocrats?   

**A:**  No. I am the aristocrat, and if I took a bride
               for my son from among your miser, e.g., your female servant, then when she came to
               our house she would become the wife of an aristocrat. So I had to request Rimpoche to
               give the girl to us. Sometimes, we needed to pay a lot of money and they would give
               her to us. If that household was your friend or relative then you didn't need to pay
               the money and they would give their daughter to you.   

**Q:**  If one of our miser's daughters went as a bride
               to one of the servants of Taring, then did we have to ask for [mi krol]?   

**A:**  No, you didn't need to ask for [Tib. mi krol]. We
               also asked for person exchange of the miser [Tib. mi brjes]. I would tell you that I
               will give you one person who is capable because there are many people. We can make
               that boy and girl to become part of the Taring miser and sometimes, they would just
               give the people if they had a friendly relationship. They would give a servant and a
               maidservant to friends and relatives who were short of servants. They had the power
               to give the miser to other people. If they said that they gave the miser, then you
               didn't need to pay anything.   

**Q:**  The miser of Taring on the estate were called
               treba or dÃ¼jung?   

**A:**  Among our misers there were two kinds. One was
               the taxpayer household and the other was the dÃ¼jung. These two were different in the
               work they did as a tax. The taxpayer households had large land holdings and the small
               householder didn't have land or they had just a small piece land for doing the
               farming. So the small householders were poorer. They also had to work less as a
               corvee tax than the taxpayer households, because they didn't have land. For the
               taxpayer household miser, they also had to work for taxes differently according to
               their land. It was very popular in Tibet that the calculation of land and taxes was
               done according to many different percentages.   

**Q:**  MCG: Did the taxpayer households have land tenure
               documents to prove that the land belonged to them?   

**A:**  For example, all the Taring miser's names were
               written in the income book, babdeb [Tib. 'bab deb] of Taring.   

**Q:**  Did the misers have a document?   

**A:**  Yes, they had the document that showed they were
               taxpayer households. In the Taring's income book, all the names of the misers were
               also written.   

**Q:**  For the miser themselves, did they have documents
               to prove the land belonged to them?   

**A:**  No, they didn't have that.   

**Q:**  If the miser said to another miser that this land
               belongs to me and doesn't belong you, then what would happen?   

**A:**  We would look in the income book of Taring and it
               would show that this and that land belonged to such and such a person. If there was a
               big household [Tib. mi tshang chen po] who had a document to prove that the land
               belonged to them, then this household was aristocratic and they wouldn't stay under
               the aristocrat. This was just like when Samdru Phodrang's miser became aristocrats.
               Taring's estate was small. Taring got separated from Sikkim and came as a refugee and
               the Taring estate was given for their salary. When they came to
               Tibet as refugees, the government gave them 1,000 khe of grain and 1,000 khe of salt.
               At that time, Taring said they didn't want 1,000 khe of grain and 1,000 khe of salt,
               and to give them a small estate. So they gave the Taring estate. Taring estate used
               to be an estate of a depÃ¶n. As for the depÃ¶n, they had an estate as salary.   

**Q:**  When you were in Tibet, did you get the income
               from the estate or did you do business? Or did you manage a dzong?   

**A:**  Actually, the income was not enough [from the
               estate]. There were different households.   

**Q:**  For Taring, was the income from the estate enough
               for the expenses in Lhasa?   

**A:**  No, it was not enough. From the estate, there
               were only 7,000 or 8,000 khe of grain per year. We didn't have big animals herds.
               There was an estate named Doptra [Tib. rdo bkra] which belonged to the Tibetan
               Government and later they gave it to Sikkim. From that estate in a year we would get
               7,000 or 8,000 khe of grain. Taring had a small estate. We received salary from the
               Government of Sikkim. Sikkim called my father-in-law twice to Sikkim to be the king,
               but he didn't go. So Sikkim was paying salary which was 6,000 English or Indian
               Rupees per year.   

**Q:**  Was it Indian Rupee?   

**A:**  That was the English or Indian Rupee. At the time
               of the Losar, from Sikkim they would send necessities like [Tib. thugs mkho] like
               rice, flour and sugar.   

**Q:**  How much did they send you?   

**A:**  They would not send much. It was two loads of
               rice, two loads of sugar, two loads of flour, and 4 loads of orange and 8 loads of
               barley beer. I remember it like it was written in the book.   

**Q:**  Those all were in good quality?   

**A:**  Yes. They would also send one load of liquor in
               which there were two bottles of whiskey. It depended on whether the chandzÃ¶ of the
               Guger Yigtsang of Sikkim is good or not. When the chandzÃ¶ was Tseden Tashi [Tib. tshe
               brtan bkra shis] and Banyag, they would send very good quality things. If the chandzÃ¶
               liked Taring, then he would send good quality things. If he didn't like Taring, then
               he would send the things which were not so good. They would also send loads of rice,
               1 load of sugar, and one load of flour saying there were the necessities for the
               Panglhasol [Tib. pang? lha gsol] 
  

**Q:**  In a year were you receiving the necessities
               twice? Once in Losar and once in Panglhasol?   

**A:**  Yes. We also had to send necessities from Tibet
               to Sikkim.   

**Q:**  What kind of necessities did you have to send?   

**A:**  We had to send dry meat and tsamba.   

**Q:**  How much dry meat did you have to send?   

**A:**  We had to send two big boxes of dry meat.   

**Q:**  You had to send it at the time of Losar?   

**A:**  Yes, we had to send 2-3 loads of tsamba. From
               Doptra we had to send 4 loads of wool.   

**Q:**  When you were sending those needs, was it like a
               gift from Tibet or what?   

**A:**  It was like sending them the products from Tibet.   

**Q:**  You were sending all those things of good
               quality?   

**A:**  Yes, we made all with good quality. In Sikkim the
               children were waiting for the dry meat because they loved it.   

**Q:**  I am wondering about some family who had few
               estates like Lungshar and KapshÃ¶ba?   

**A:**  Yes, but KapshÃ¶ba was quite okay.   

**Q:**  To become a kalÃ¶n was very expensive so how did
               they do it if they didn't have money?   

**A:**  People were smart and were gambling and doing
               risky business. They were thinking that if they got the position of kalÃ¶n then they
               could make more money than they spent on getting the position of kalÃ¶n. So among the
               ministers, some of them were just doing their own things and some of them were
               working for the country. When the ministers were working for themselves, then the
               state wouldn't get developed.   

**Q:**  So did the bigger families have a bigger
               advantage because they had lots of money?   

**A:**  They were bigger households from the beginning
               and when the price of butter and grain would go up, then the big households would
               make lots of money. The households who didn't produce enough butter and grain, didn't
               have much income. We did not get enough from our estate.   

**Q:**  So what would happen to aristocrats who didn't
               have many estates? How could they make more money? Did they try to request to manage
               a dzong or an estate?   

**A:**  Regarding requesting to manage a dzong or estate
               [Tib. rdzong gzhis], during the time of the 13th Dalai Lama, there was no way to do
               this unless the government appointed you. The Dalai Lama was careful about appointing
               persons to manage the dzong and estates. So there was not much corruption like giving
               bribes for getting positions. After the 13th Dalai Lama passed away, and at the time
               of the regents, it happened a lot. When you got the chance to manage a dzong or
               estate if one didn't treat the miser well and one just worked for themselves, then
               the dzongpÃ¶n would become rich.   

**Q:**  How did the person who manged a dzong or estate
               become rich? I am not clear about that. Didn't they have to deliver income to the
               government? Were there any limits like on how much income they would get and how much
               they had to spend? I think they might have had limitations.   

**A:**  From the beginning, they had a fixed amount of
               income. They would be told that if you go to manage that dzong there will be this
               much income. So the dzongpÃ¶n could get a good income also and the person who managed
               the dzong or estate could also do business from that dzong like buying wool. If the
               person who managed the dzong treated the miser nicely, then they wouldn't get much
               profit for themselves.   

**Q:**  Did the person who managed the dzong or estate
               have to deliver the income to the government or was there some trick or what?   

**A:**  No. There was no way to avoid to delivering the
               income to the government because they had to deliver it according to the income book,
               whether you got a good yield or not.   

**Q:**  What would happen if there was a deficit in
               delivering the income?   

**A:**  There would be a little deficit, but they
               couldn't avoid paying the income. You had to deliver the income according to a fixed
               amount that was set from the early times like a tax. If you had some extra income to
               deliver to the government, there was also competition among the persons who managed
               the dzong or estate where they would compete about who could deliver more income to
               the government. If someone requested the job of managing a better
               dzong or estate he had to pay a lot of money to the regent or the kalÃ¶n to get
               appointed. So he had to get back the money that he paid. This was done by making
               money for himself and it was not for being beneficial to the people in the dzong.
               Since he had his own aim to make himself rich, the miser would suffer a lot. So there
               were big errors about this issue. If a person really wanted to
               treat the miser fairly, it was like Tsarong said: it was not okay if we didn't take
               care of the miser's livelihood and set up schools in the remote places. But it was
               difficult to do that.   

**Q:**  For example, the yield you were getting from
               Taring estate was not enough for you, right?   

**A:**  Yes, it was not enough.   

**Q:**  The necessities from Sikkim were also only a
               small amount, right?   

**A:**  Yes.   

**Q:**  The 6,000 English Rupees was for one year?   

**A:**  Yes. This money was paid to my father-in-law and
               mother-in-law until their death. My husband and I didn't get that 6,000 Rupees.   

**Q:**  Didn't they send anything to the children?   

**A:**  They would just send a little amount for the
               children. My husband got a salary from the Laja Office where he worked.   

**Q:**  What kind of salary did he get from the Laja?   

**A:**  For one year there were 12 loads of butter packed
               in skin bags [Tib. mar ltang] and 8-9 loads of fruit and 4 loads of brick tea packed
               in leather. This was useful for the home expenses.   

**Q:**  Was there any other salary?   

**A:**  There was also some woolen material [Tib. snam
               bu] and fruit for the New Year. The most useful was the brick tea and butter.   

**Q:**  That was also not enough, right?   

**A:**  Yes. We were also doing business.   

**Q:**  You had no choice but to do the business, right?   

**A:**  Yes. Consequently, I sent people to do business.
               I sent people to Sadam [Tib. sa dam] [in Yunnan] with 100 boxes of cigarettes and
               200-300 loads of cloth.   

**Q:**  Those were things you would buy from India,
               right?   

**A:**  Yes. I also went to India and bought round tea
               bricks [Tib. bya ril] and I sold them here. If we didn't do business, it would have
               been difficult because we had to send the children to school and we had to do the
               construction.   

**Q:**  Is it right that the big aristocrats didn't need
               to do business and had enough from their estates? For example, Sambo and ThÃ¶npa [Tib.
               thon pa] didn't need to do business, right?   

**A:**  Their livelihoods were very good. When the price
               of butter and grain would go up, they would have a lot of money. Small aristocrats
               had to do business. Jigme la and I were doing business because Taring just had enough
               for his parents. I also bought about 1,000 loads of leather for making boots and
               1,000 loads of round tea brick from India. That's how it was. There are still some
               things left to tell you about the Tsarong Sawangchemmo.   

**Q:**  Please tell us.   

**A:**  What I have to say is, where were we?
               Sawangchemmo got demoted from the Kashag and stayed for a few year like that. Then he
               went to Trapchi Office and worked very hard. In the past, the salary of the Dalai
               Lama's father was paid from the Trapchi Office. One day they were kind of not ready
               to pay that salary so the father of the Dalai Lama got angry and told Sawangchemmo,
               "Take your bedding with you and come here." Then he said that he should stay there
               [in the office]. "Why didn't you pay my salary?" Sawangchemmo told him, "We were
               working hard and we didn't say this only to you. I am just thinking that when the
               Dalai Lama is grown up, I would like to hand over a strong government to him. I
               didn't have any other thought." Then the Dalai Lama's father said, "You go home."   

**Q:**  One time, Taring got beaten by the Dalai Lama's
               father, right?   

**A:**  No, he didn't beat him. But he scolded him many
               times. He said, "Look at your house. Why didn't you built a good house for me?" The
               Dalai Lama's father went to beat NgabÃ¶ and NgabÃ¶ ran away.   

**Q:**  He held a gun and chased NgabÃ¶, right?   

**A:**  I didn't hear about him holding the gun. The
               Dalai Lama's father scolded my husband many times. At that time, my husband was the
               official in charge of construction when they doing the construction for Yabshi.
               Because the new Dalai Lama had come, they had to build a house for parents of the
               Dalai Lama and their servants. The Dalai Lama's father was complaining that the walls
               and the rafters were not good. He was saying to my husband, "Look at your house. How
               did you build that?" He said he was sorry.   

**Q:**  You could only say, "I am sorry?"   

**A:**  Yes, you could only say "I am sorry" because he
               was the father of the Dalai Lama.   

**Q:**  Couldn't he tell him that after the painting was
               finished it would look good?   

**A:**  No, we couldn't. One day my husband got scolded
               by the Dalai Lama's father who said, "The size of stable is too small and don't you
               know that the horse will get wet when it rains?" No matter whether the Dalai Lama's
               father scolded people or beat them up, they had to bear it because the Dalai Lama was
               magnificent. And even if he beat them up, people would run away.   

**Q:**  When they gouged out Lungshar's eyeballs,
               Sawangchemmo was not in Lhasa, right? He was at his estate, right?   

**A:**  Yes, he was not in Lhasa.   

**Q:**  Initially, when they held the meeting, was
               Sawangchemmo at the meeting?   

**A:**  No, he was not in the meeting. When they gouged
               out Lungshar's eyeballs, we were very afraid.   

**Q:**  Why did you feel afraid?   

**A:**  We felt compassion for him because his eyeballs
               were gouged out. We were saying what would we do. At that time, I heard that they
               were making an agreement called, "All people agreeing on the direction that leads
               towards happiness." [Tib. Kyipai Chokla Kunthun [skyid pa'i phyogs la kun mthun]).
               But we didn't go to sign the agreement.   

**Q:**  What do you mean by gengya?   

**A:**  Gengya means an agreement.   

**Q:**  What did they agree to do?   

**A:**  It said, "I agree with the issue." It was like,
               "Whatever you do, I will agree with you."   

**Q:**  Did somebody come to your house and ask whether
               or not you agreed with this?   

**A:**  It was not like that. People were saying that
               there was an agreement, so you should go and sign the agreement. Some people went
               there and signed the agreement, saying that you are doing a good job and I agree with
               you. So the number of people agreeing with Lungshar was increasing.   

**Q:**  Where would you go [to do this]?   

**A:**  People would go to Lungshar's house. Some of the
               people were telling Jigme la that most of the people were going to sign the
               agreement, so what did he want to do? We were wondering what we should do. We didn't
               go there. We and Dingja [Tib. lding cha] and Choktre [Tib. lcog bkras] discussed
               going there but we didn't go.   

**Q:**  At that time, what did you think the agreement
               was for?   

**A:**  We just knew that the name was Kyipai Chokla
               Kunthun, but we didn't know the meaning. How should I say it in English?   

**Q:**  That is like a debate. In the agreement there
               might be the meaning?   

**A:**  It was a written agreement.   

**Q:**  They didn't know the meaning of the agreement,
               right?   

**A:**  Some people might have known the meaning. If you
               went to put your seal on the agreement paper they might have told you the meaning and
               you would know the meaning. If you went there and if you said that I agree with this
               so tell me the meaning about the agreement, then they would tell you the meaning. At
               that time, people who put their seal on the agreement might know the meaning. At
               first they did some publicizing. They would tell people what they were doing, and ask
               if they wanted to join. People came and looked at the agreement paper and they agreed
               with that. I think probably, that agreement was for changing the system in Tibet.   

**Q:**  At that time what did you think about this? Did
               you think if people did this, it would cause trouble for the people?   

**A:**  We didn't know what we should do, but the name of
               the agreement sounded very good. Anyhow, we needed a kind of reform, but we didn't
               know what would be the way of doing the reform. We were saying that Tsarong was not
               here, so there was no one we could seek advice from about that.   

**Q:**  For example, you knew the English language,
               right?   

**A:**  Yes.   

**Q:**  Dingja also knew English, right?   

**A:**  No, he didn't know English.   

**Q:**  Jogtre [Tib. lcog bkras] also didn't know
               English, right?   

**A:**  Yes.   

**Q:**  But he was a person who knew things, right?   

**A:**  Yes.   

**Q:**  When you were discussing with Dingja and Joktre,
               what were you all saying?   

**A:**  We were saying that we heard that there was an
               agreement and what was in there and what shall we do? Usually, we would seek advice
               from Sawangchemmo, but he was not here. We were talking like that. One day, people
               were saying that today they were going to gouge the eyeballs of Lungshar.   

**Q:**  The people thought that no matter whether the
               words sound nice or not, it was meant to be some kind of change, right?   

**A:**  Yes.   

**Q:**  Do you think if Sawangchemmo had been in Lhasa,
               he would have done it?   

**A:**  I don't think he would have agreed with that. If
               he knew the meaning well, he might have done it. We didn't know the meaning then.
               Sawangchemmo said that he was very lucky that he was not in Lhasa when the 13th Dalai
               lama passed away. He said, "If I had been here, I would have given an aspirin to the
               Dalai Lama when he caught a fever. Therefore, I would have been banished. I was very
               lucky that I got that leave."   

**Q:**  What kind of special thing did Sawangchemmo do in
               Trapchi? Later, he built the Trisam bridge [Tib. khri zam] and he built one bridge in
               Drigung [Tib. 'bri gung], right?   

**A:**  Yes, there was a narrow passage between the river
               and the mountain from Nyetang [Tib. mnyes thang] and Nam [Tib. rnam] so he destroyed
               this narrow passage [built a wider road] Before he destroyed the narrow passage, the
               horses and donkeys used to fall down into the river. He liked to build the road.   

**Q:**  Do you have anything else to tell us?   

**A:**  Just before the Chinese came, the Dalai Lama and
               the government moved to Yadong. At that time, all the aristocrats also ran away to
               here [India] and Tsarong was also there.   

**Q:**  You said that in Lhasa Reting the regent told
               Sawangchemmo to be a kalÃ¶n, but he didn't agree, right?   

**A:**  Yes.   

**Q:**  At that time, other people were pushing to get
               the kalÃ¶n position so why didn't Tsarong do it? What was the reason?   

**A:**  Because he had been working as a kalÃ¶n and he saw
               that there was nothing beneficial for the development of the country by accepting it.   

**Q:**  Did the regent send a letter or a message written
               on a samtra board?   

**A:**  He told Sawangchemmo in person [unclear]. The
               Regent was very fond of Tsarong.   

**Q:**  I heard that the regent would come to Tsarong and
               stay there and swing on the swing, right?   

**A:**  Yes, Sawangchemmo invited the regent and they
               watched movies and stayed in the garden.   

**Q:**  When was that?   

**A:**  At that time that Reting was the regent. It was
               in the 1940's.   

**Q:**  After Sawangchemmo didn't accept the rank of
               kalÃ¶n, who got appointed as the kalÃ¶n by the regent?   

**A:**  He appointed BÃ¶nshÃ¶ as the kalÃ¶n. After that, the
               Chinese came to Tibet. Sawangchemmo came back and at some point the children were
               also withdrawn from the school [in India]. He thought whatever would happen, we would
               stay here [in Lhasa] and he thought that the Chinese might treat them well. It seemed
               that this was the only way. At that time, the Chinese were doing things
               inconsistently [Tib. yin tsam min tsam]. So DÃ¼ndÃ¼l la, the son of
               Tsarong, came here, though they didn't have any thought of staying in India.
               Sawangchemmo gave things to the children. After that, Sawangchemmo said, "I am
               getting old, so I am going to invite the Dalai Lama to the Assembly at the MÃ¶nlam
               Chemmo." This ceremony was called Tshogpheb [Tib. tshogs phebs]. Sawangchemmo had the
               Tsarong estate which used to belong to my father and this was the estate from where
               he got the name. Sawangchemmo also got estates from the government
               for his military accomplishments. The name of the estates were Paling [Tib. dpal
               gling] and Lhanga [Tib. lha lnga]. He also bought [took] the estate called Miru in
               Shang as repayment for a loan and there was an estate in Chushul. He sold all the
               grain from those estates and collected all the money and he also used the belongings
               in the house like thick brocade [Tib. rgya se] and whatever precious things there
               were when he invited the Dalai Lama for the MÃ¶nlam Chemmo in Lhasa's Jokhang temple.
               At that time, there were about 20,000 monks assembled together. All the holy lamas
               would attend the assembly and at that time, we had to offer alms, tea, and rice gruel
               [Tib. ming btags] as the food.   

**Q:**  No. I think it was a thick rice porridge because
               you couldn't offer rice gruel. It was out of the question to serve rice gruel.   

**A:**  Oh! No, for the Tsogpheb, probably we offered the
               rice gruel.   

**Q:**  No, you couldn't. How could you offer it?   

**A:**  So I think we served a thick rice porridge.
               Sawangchemmo offered all the belongings in Tsarong to the Dalai Lama. He went to get
               an audience with the Dalai Lama. At that time, all the grain of Tsarong were sold and
               the Chinese didn't get grain from Tsarong. Everything was offered to the monks. After
               that, my sister died. Tsarong used to treat her very well. The elder wife, Rinzin
               ChÃ¶drÃ¶n, when she was 50 years old, she asked for leave and went back to her home
               Delerabten [Tib. bde legs rab brtan] in Shigatse and became a nun. When his younger
               wife Pema Drolker [Tib. pad ma sgrol kar] got ill, Sawangchemmo treated her very
               well. After his wife died, he made very good offerings to the lamas and monks. There
               were many houses and he divided all the houses among his children. When he offered
               the alms for the monks, he also gave 500 dotse to each of his friends and relatives
               like Dingja, Delerabten, and to the children and to me.   

**Q:**  Did he give the 500 dotse at the time of
               Tsogpheb?   

**A:**  He gave it just after the Tsogpheb. After that,
               my sister died in 1957. When the uprising for Tibetan freedom took place,
               Sawangchemmo went to join the meeting in ShÃ¶l. On the day that he went to the
               meeting, I met him for a short time. I think that was on the 8th when we met. He said
               the situation was not good. He was trying to tell me more and he asked where I went.
               I said, "I went to the meeting of the Women's Association and the [situation] in the
               meeting was not good at all." The Chinese were not doing well and the Chinese were
               suspicious of me. I told him like that. At that time, when the two
               of us were trying to talk more, they were saying Tritsab [Tib. kri tshab] Rimpoche
               was coming, so I left. I heard that Tritsab Rimpoche didn't treat him well. Since
               then I didn't see him. Then they imprisoned him and later he said he was with Sambo
               DepÃ¶n and Tromo Geshe Rimpoche [Tib. gro mo dge bshes rin po che]. He told me to work
               hard and that he didn't have any problems. They showed a movie at night and they had
               to work in the vegetable garden. At first, their legs were shackled. Later they [the
               Chinese] removed the shackles. He and Drunyichemmo Bumtang [Tib. 'bum thang] were in
               one cell. On the next day, they made the preparations for holding a struggle session
               against Tsarong and beat him up. They called all of his servants. On that morning
               when they called him to get up, he had died. Then they called his children and his
               daughters like Sonam Drolma [Tib. bsod nams sgrol ma] and Thondrub Drolma [Tib. don
               grub sgrol ma] to take his body.   

**Q:**  Do you know about KapshÃ¶ba selling an estate to
               Phabongka [Tib. pha bong kha]?   

**A:**  No, I don't know about it.   

**Q:**  How did they sell the estates?   

**A:**  You can sell an estate. You have to give the
               tenure document for the estate which shows that the estate is yours.   

**Q:**  What would they do about the taxes?   

**A:**  They had to say that the taxes would be paid by
               the buyer. Then the document was handed over.   

**Q:**  Was it allowed to sell the estate which was given
               for serving the government as an official [Tib. zhabs rten pha gzhis]?   

**A:**  No, you were not allowed to sell it. There were
               different kinds of estates and some of the branch states could be sold or bought. If
               an aristocrat couldn't serve the government because his estate for serving the
               government was too small, he could also ask for the permission to just pay money
               [Tib. dod] in place of serving the government. The law on estates was kind of loose.   

**Q:**  Some of them were offering their estates to
               lamas, right?   

**A:**  Yes. For example Dekyiling [Tib. bde skyid gling]
               offered the estate to RadÃ¶ Rimpoche [Tib. ra stod rin po che] and Dathang [Tib. mda'
               thang] also offered their estate to Kyabji Rimpoche [Tib. skyabs rje rin po che].   

**Q:**  As for the miser, was it the same whoever their
               lord was?   

**A:**  Yes. There were little differences regarding the
               lords. For example, some were kind to the miser and some of them were not. When
               people offered the estate to a high Lama who was liked by the people, even though
               people want to cause problems, they wouldn't dare to do that. For example, Dathang's
               estate was offered to Kyabji Rimpoche and people said that was very good and they
               didn't dare to go against it. That's how it was. Miru Estate was also attached to
               Tsarong. I am not sure if it was repayment for a loan or if it was bought.   

**Q:**  People were also paying estates for loans?   

**A:**  Yes, there were things like that. If they handed
               over the land tenure document, then it was okay.   

**Q:**  I heard Tsarong lent a lot of loans to KapshÃ¶ba,
               right?   

**A:**  I don't think so. I don't think he would give
               loans to KapshÃ¶ba because KapshÃ¶ba wouldn't pay back properly.   

**Q:**  If you sold an estate to a trader, could he
               become a government official [Tib. gzhung zhabs] or not?   

**A:**  Probably, you were not allowed to sell the estate
               that was your estate for serving the government. You could sell the other branch
               estates.   

**Q:**  If the person who bought the estate was not an
               aristocrat, could he buy the estate?   

**A:**  He had to pay the tax to government. You must
               have good documents to prove the ownership of the estate. If they didn't have good
               documents, then the buyer wouldn't be able to trust them. If you have the exclusive
               documents for a particular estate and if the conditions were complete, then one could
               sell it and someone could buy it. People could also give estate as a share of family
               property when a couple got divorced.   

**Q:**  In Lhasa, how did the price for commodities go up
               in the years 1920, 1930, 1940? This is the one thing. Also do you remember what
               social changes happened in Lhasa, like clothing? For example, regarding wearing the
               head ornament or patrug [Tib. spa phrug] and the long false hair called lentse [Tib.
               lan rtse] and about men's clothing?   

**Q:**  When you first came back from Delhi in 1950,
               there were a lot of things changed, right?   

**A:**  Yes.   

**Q:**  Now if you look at the society in Lhasa in 1925
               when you came back from India, what kind of changes occurred between 1925-1950? Maybe
               there were no changes, I don't know. There were changes concerning wearing the apron
               -- they made them shorter, right?   

**A:**  Yes, there were many social changes. When we were
               children, for example, the wives of the kalÃ¶n and the wives of high aristocratic like
               Gung and Theiji, and especially the wives of the kalÃ¶n, were not allowed to go out
               without wearing the sleeveless dress (Tib. tengtsag [Tib. steng brtsegs])worn over
               the chupa, and the pearl headdress [Tib. mu tig spa phuag].   

**Q:**  You had to wear the Tengtsag on your back?   

**A:**  Usually, the tengtsag was worn over the chupa.
               They would not wear the shawl, but they would wear a scarf. Wherever they would go
               they had to wear the pearl headdress and they had to take two male servants wearing
               the Mongolian hat [Tib. sog zhwa] and the maid servants also had to wear the
               headdress and the pendant and the turquoise earring.   

**Q:**  Was that during the time of the 13th Dalai Lama?   

**A:**  Yes, that was the time of the 13th Dalai Lama.
               The difficulty for all the wives of the kalÃ¶n was that they had to attach long false
               hair to their heads. They had to wear the headdress all the time. If they didn't wear
               the headdress, then it would be considered inauspicious.   

**Q:**  The false hair was tied to their real hair?   

**A:**  Yes.   

**Q:**  Did they have to wear it even in bed?   

**A:**  Yes.   

**Q:**  Oh! My god!   

**A:**  That's how it was.   

**Q:**  In the bed they didn't have to wear the
               headdress; they could wear the false hair, right?   

**A:**  They didn't wear the headdress. They wore only
               the false hair. That was very hard. After that, since I was a child, the system
               changed. Before going to bed they could take off the false hair. In the past, the
               false hair was thick and heavy, but later they made the false hair a little lighter.   

**Q:**  When did that change happen?   

**A:**  The changes began in the years 1920-1922.   

**Q:**  When you went out did you have to wear the false
               hair?   

**A:**  Yes. You could take off the false hair when you
               went to bed and people were saying that that was a big change. For example, when
               girls became 16-17 years old and when a girl first wore the headdress, they had to
               celebrate it. When girls first had their hair braided, they had to put corals and
               turquoise on the braid and this was called tagzar [Tib. ltag 'dzar].   

**Q:**  What kind of celebration did they do?   

**A:**  They would serve ceremonial food made from wild
               sweet potato, rice, sugar, and butter tea [Tib. gro ma 'bras sel] and they would give
               the khata scarves. This ceremony was in the house. There was a much bigger ceremony
               when the girl first wore the headdress at the age of 15-16. This and wearing the
               apron meant she became an adult. The parent had to make all the
               jewelry. After she wore the headdress then she would wear the apron. Some foreigners
               think that the apron was to distinguish between married women and unmarred women and
               the apron was sign of being married. That was not true. They would go on pilgrimages
               to the Buddha statue in Jokhang. The family also made them wear Tangtsag according to
               their condition.   

**Q:**  They would put on the Tangtsag?   

**A:**  Yes.   

**Q:**  They wouldn't put the pearl headdress on?   

**A:**  On that, they would make her wear all the dresses
               of the high rank official's wife [Tib. lha lcam].   

**Q:**  Even though she was not a wife of a kalÃ¶n they
               would make her wear the dress?   

**A:**  Yes.   

**Q:**  Did they let her wear the white boots called
               resom [Tib. ras zon]?   

**A:**  They didn't make them wear resom much. When the
               girl was sent as a bride, they would make her wear the resom. Otherwise, you could
               wear woolen boots (Tib. sonpa [zon pa]). The ceremony would be held in the protector
               deity's chapel [Tib. mgon khang] and the temple [Tib. mchod khang] and all the
               servants would offer khata. The friends and relatives would come and give presents.
               On that day, whatever presents she got would be given to her. At that time, wearing
               the headdress was very common. After quite a while, since the headdresses were heavy,
               the people didn't like them and they wore them less and less, and then they stopped
               wearing the headdresses. Since 13th Dalai Lama passed away in 1940s
               [1932], it just started that lots of people didn't wear their headdresses. Until that
               time, all the wives of aristocratics wouldn't go out without wearing the headdress.
               After that, women who were wearing headdresses became fewer.
               However, for quite a long time, at the time of the 21 days of the MÃ¶nlam Chemmo, if
               you didn't wear the headdress when you went out, the two monastic officials in charge
               of monitoring discipline in large monasteries, the Tsogchen Shengo, would beat you no
               matter whether you were the wife of an aristocrat or an ordinary woman. When you went
               to get a blessing from the Prayer Assembly [Tib. tshogs mjal] you had to wear the
               headdress and the false hair. This system lasted until 1959.   

**Q:**  Who was the first wife of an aristocrat who
               didn't wear the headdress?   

**A:**  I can't tell you this. It was just one woman
               after another who didn't wear the headdress. Especially, you were not allowed to go
               to Norbulinga without wearing the headdress. If you didn't wear the headdress, the
               guard at the gate of Norbulinga wouldn't let you in. In Norbulinga, women should wear
               chupa with sleeves. If they wore the sleeveless chupa, it would be considered
               disrespectful. After quite a long time, women wearing the headdress became less. They
               didn't wear the headdress and it became fashionable to wear a pendant. And then after
               a while, they wore the fur hat with brocade called Tsering Kyinkhab [Tib. tshe ring
               skyin khab] and the Nyangsha [Tib. myang zhwa].   

**Q:**  Were they were wearing a hat called Tsering
               Kyinkhab instead of the headdress?   

**A:**  After quite a while, they wore the Tsering
               Kyinkhab and also a new style of hat without the outer brocade covering called
               Nyangsha. After that, women became more courageous and more and more wore hats.   

**Q:**  After that they didn't even wear the hat, right?   

**A:**  Yes.   

**Q:**  In the past, when the wife of kalÃ¶n didn't wear
               the headdress when they went out, would people say that she wasn't wearing the
               headdress?   

**A:**  Yes, it happened like that. But I am sure that
               the old wives of the high ranking officials wore the headdress until they died.   

**Q:**  The young women didn't wear the headdress?   

**A:**  Yes. The old women passed away and the young
               women acted rebellious. Then the pendant became very fashionable. They just left the
               headdress behind and they put on diamond pendants. But when they went to attend
               parties they had to wear the headdress and also the turquoise earrings [Tib. as kor].   

**Q:**  Did they wear the headdress when offering the
               khata at the gathering and after that did they take off the headdress?   

**A:**  They wore the headdress at the party of the
               Kashag all the time. For the bigger parties, they had to wear the headdress. They
               definitely had to wear the headdress at government parties like the Kashag party and
               the lay official summer picnics called [Tib. drung spyi dbyar skyid]. After that, people were saying that they couldn't risk the danger because there
               were many thieves in town and if they wore the headdress when they came back from the
               party at night, the thieves would rob them. The situation in town became worse and
               there were more thieves. In the past, even if you went out at night wearing the
               headdress, no one would rob you. That's how it happened. They were wearing diamond
               earrings that became very popular and they paid a very high price for the turquoise
               earrings. The bead zi also became very fashionable.   

**Q:**  Tell me about the things that became fashionable
               one after another and when something became more fashionable and another thing became
               less fashionable?   

**A:**  After wearing headdresses became less, people
               wanted to wear more valuable jewelry. So those wives of aristocrats considered
               jewelery like investing money. After that, diamonds became fashionable and they were
               paying several 10,000 yuan for diamond earrings and rings and pendants which became
               very fashionable. It changed a lot in the clothing. Earlier, they used to tie the
               belt low and later people tied their belt higher.   

**Q:**  First pendants became fashionable. I remember
               that there were differently shaped pendants like the one with eight points called
               shokgyema [Tib. shog brgyad ma] and there were pendants that were shaped like stars
               like semarango [Tib. ze ma ra mgo], and there were also pendants with shapes like the
               moon right?   

**A:**  Yes, there were different pendants. This pendant
               [points] was an old style pendant. There were also pendants which came out at the
               middle time [Tib. bar thon]. In the past, they put turquoise on the pendant. I will
               show you the pendant with peach shaped turquoise designs on it. That kind of came out
               at the middle time. Afterward, women said that they would make fashionable pendants
               and then they would just make fashionable ones all the time.   

**Q:**  After that they made the star pendant, right?   

**A:**  That was kind of a false pendant. People were
               becoming greedy and at parties they were wearing the bigger pendants and under that
               they made a false pendant attached to the necklace to be used simply. Each
               aristocratic wife had one big pendant and several false pendants. Some of them were
               wearing Zi beads. They were very attentive to jewelry. Some of the wives were saying
               that if you had good jewelry that would be like investing money for the future. And
               there also were changes in the clothing worn. In the past, the sleeves of the chupa
               were long.   

**Q:**  When did these changes take place?   

**A:**  It kept on changing.   

**Q:**  Don't say it kept on changing. Do you remember
               when people were wearing long sleeves?   

**A:**  Yes, I remember that my late mother wore the long
               sleeves when she danced.   

**Q:**  Did you wear long sleeves?   

**A:**  No, I didn't wear long sleeves. It had changed by
               that time. When I was young, people were wearing narrow [Tib. phra po] sleeves.
               Before that, they wore long sleeves.   

**Q:**  When did they wear the long sleeves?   

**A:**  Since 1921-25 people started wearing Tsering
               Kyingkhab hats and wearing thin sleeves.   

**Q:**  At that time, they were wearing Tsering Kyingkhab
               hats and narrow sleeved shirts with sleeveless chupa [Tib. phu med], right?   

**A:**  Then it changed into longer sleeves.   

**Q:**  But they were still wearing Tsering Kyinkhab,
               right?   

**A:**  Yes.   

**Q:**  When did they start wearing Nyangsha [Tib. myang
               zhwa]?   

**A:**  The Nyangzha [literally means hat of mourning]
               was made from brocade. A lot of people were wearing that hat.   

**Q:**  At some point weren't people wearing the Kongpo
               area's hat style?   

**A:**  A few people were wearing that. That's how it
               changed.   

**Q:**  In which year did they wear those hats?   

**A:**  The hat Tsering Kyingkhab became fashionable in
               the late 1920s. In the past, people tied the belt on their stomachs but later they
               tied their belt a little higher. For blouses. in the past they were wearing long
               sleeves and later it became shorter.   

**Q:**  In the 1940s, they were wearing long sleeves and
               from then on did it remain the same?   

**A:**  The apron also changed. In the past, the apron
               was said to be worn when people were working and later it became fashionable. In the
               past, they put small triangle decorations made of brocade on two sides of the apron
               (Tib. drogden [sgrog gdan]). Later they put big drogden on the aprons which were made
               from thick brocade. In the past, they would wear scarves with the headdress and later
               people didn't wear the scarf.   

**Q:**  In the past, did they have to wear the scarf even
               though they wore the headdress?   

**A:**  Yes, when you wore the headdress, you had to take
               the scarf with you. Nowadays, the Bhutanese are wearing the scarf.   

**Q:**  Was that because you might feel cold?   

**A:**  They must take the scarf. The wife of Phunkhang
               always had the scarf with her. In Norbulinga you were not allowed to use an umbrella,
               so in the sunshine you could use the scarf as an umbrella.   

**Q:**  When did people stop wearing scarves?   

**A:**  It has been a long time since people have worn
               scarves, although they had to wear scarves in big ceremonies. When you went as a
               bride you had to wear a scarf and shawl.   

**Q:**  When did they stop wearing the shawl?   

**A:**  They didn't stop wearing shawls.   

**Q:**  They would wear the shawl in big ceremonies, but
               not every day, right?   

**A:**  Even though they didn't wear the shawl every day,
               they had to wear the shawl in big ceremonies and at weddings. At the big parties, the
               women who served the barley beer [Tib. 'khrungs zhu ma] had to wear scarves and the
               jewelry ornaments and shawl. That system was carried on even after the Chinese came
               to Tibet. When we were having the lay official's summer picnic
               [Tib. drung spyi dbyar skid] people were wearing all the jewelry. This system was
               carried on until the Tibetan uprising. Usually there were more women who they didn't
               wear the headdress, but the main system of wearing the jewelry was continued until
               the Tibetan uprising.   

**Q:**  Was there any change regarding the age at
               marriage?   

**A:**  No. That didn't change in Tibet. In the past, in
               some cases they were getting married at a young age, like 14-15. But most people
               would send the bride at the age of 17 or 18, which was the right time. They didn't
               arrange the marriage at the age of 11 or 12 like in India. In some cases there was am
               arranged marriage system. For example, if you had a baby girl and if I had a boy, we
               would say that in the future our son and your daughter will get married. It happened like that, you know the wife of WangdÃ¼ La [Tib. dbang
               'dus lags] and my elder sister from Delerabten were friends. They said that in the
               future if you give a birth to a baby boy and if I give birth to a baby girl then we
               will arrange their marriage. After that, they had a very hard time and it didn't go
               well. It happened like that because of one's Karmic effect. Regarding men, they also
               changed the style of their head knot (Tib. pajok [spa lcog]).   

**Q:**  How did that change?   

**A:**  In the past, the style of head knots was like
               this. Later they made the head knot up like false hair.   

**Q:**  I guess that's all?   

**A:**  Yes. The people who usually wore the Tsechuma
               [Tib. tshal phyu ma] used to have their belt tied high and in the past it was tied
               lower. The sleeves also used to be broader, but later they became narrower.   

**Q:**  Would they wear the chupa Tsechuma in the past?   

**A:**  In the past the sleeve of a chupa was very big.
               The people who usually wear the kind of chupa called Chubchen [Tib. phyu chen] would
               put the belt low. The men's chupa also changed and they tied their belts higher and
               they made their sleeves shorter like women's.   

**Q:**  Were they wearing the Tsechuma from long ago?   

**A:**  I was told that they were wearing Tsechuma in
               early times under their chupas. They were wearing the Tsechuma at the time of my
               father. That's how it was. Tibetan social laws were very strict.   

**Q:**  In the past they were talking about whether you
               could wear leather shoes, right?   

**A:**  You were not allowed to wear leather shoes and
               use the Indian saddle. If you put on an Indian saddle, they would rob it. Basically,
               Tibetan law has been strict. If women wore yellow and orange clothing, they would
               scold you and say that yellow and orange were the colors of monks and not the colors
               of women. At some point, they were doing some meaningless things like that.   

**Q:**  Were there any changes in economics, e.g., price
               of the things?   

**A:**  Yes, there were many changes. For example, since
               I can remember, in 1925 or in 1926, the price of one square of brocade was 1-2-3
               sang. However, before we left Lhasa [for exile] the price of brocade had gone up to
               250 srang which was equal to 5 dotse. In 1925, one Bo [Tib. 'bo] of barley was 1
               srang.   

**Q:**  The price went up from 1 sang. Since I can
               remember, the price of one Bo of barley was 7 sang and 5 sho. That stayed for quite a
               long time, right?   

**A:**  Later, the price of barley went up to 25 sang.
               After that it went up to 50 sang. At that time the big households were saying that we
               should hold the barley until the price went up to 100 sang. Then we should repay the
               loans.   

**Q:**  Did the price of barley go up to 100 sang?   

**A:**  Yes. Later the price of barley went up to 250
               sang. Butter and meat were also expensive.   

**Q:**  When did the big changes in price take place? Did
               it happen gradually or did the price go up rapidly after the 1940s?   

**A:**  The price went up rapidly for most things after
               the Chinese came. Before that the price increased only gradually.   

**Q:**  You remember the price of barley went up from 5
               sho to 1 sang. I remember that in 1945-1946, when I was 6-7 years old, the price of
               barley was 7 sang and 5 sho. During the time of the regent Taktra [Tib. stag brag],
               prices went up very high, right?   

**A:**  People were saying that at the time of the regent
               Reting the economic condition [Tib. skya nam] was quite good. Anyway, prices
               gradually increased. The cause of the inflation was because the government was just
               printing more money.   

**Q:**  How did they print more money? Did they print
               more paper currency?   

**A:**  They printed many kinds of paper currency so
               there was more money [in circulation] and prices went up. In the past, in Lhasa, one
               maund of sugar cost 50 Indian rupees [Tib. sgor mo].   

**Q:**  Was 50 sang considered expensive?   

**A:**  Yes. That was very expensive. Just after we came
               back from school in India, at that time, 1 Indian rupee was not even worth one sang;
               it was 7 sho. Later, one rupee was worth 15 sang. In 1925, one Indian rupee was not
               even one sang.   

**Q:**  At some point, one Indian rupee was worth 5 sang
               and it remained that way for long time, right?   

**A:**  It remained that way for a long time. Later it
               went up to 15 sang for one Indian rupee.   

**Q:**  At that time, a dayan was also worth 15 sang,
               right?   

**A:**  Yes. One dayan was equal to 3 rupees.   

**Q:**  So it was 5 sang for one rupee, right?   

**A:**  I think it went up more than that. The price of
               grain and Indian cloth also increased. But at that time all the people had abundant
               money. The price of things increased because people had an abundance of money. This
               is my opinion. I think that if they say that if people's stomachs became large, then
               it is too bad and one won't be able to fill it. If we say the price of things went
               up, it seems like people were having abundant money. If your salary increased, then
               when you bought things, it would become easier. If they sold you things that you
               needed like fruit and cloth and they charged more, you also had more to pay. So it
               just depended on how abundant your money was. For example, if they said that the crop
               grew less this year than last year, e.g., if they said that last year they got yields
               5-10 times the seed sown, and this year it was only 3-4 times a yield, then we won't
               have enough food to eat, so we would be finished. Paying more paper currency to each
               other just became extra work. That's all. This is my own opinion. I
               think about a lot of things. For example, when we plant barley, if we plant one grain
               and at the time of harvest the yield becomes 10 grains, this is precious. For one
               grain of barley there would be one ear of stalk and there would be many grains in
               that. If the ear of a stalk grain got worse, then it was finished.
               Some people were saying that in the past the grains of barley were big like this and
               now they have became smaller. In our generation, the grain didn't become smaller. The
               size of people's stomach was same as before. What happened is that the money became
               abundant and I think the price of things remained same as before. I have always had
               this kind of thought. It is too bad if they say the yield was getting worse and the
               cow wasn't giving much milk. If you had money, you would get milk. Everywhere, money
               became abundant. In Tibet, they printed many 100 sang notes. I was
               told by Tsarong that if the government didn't have much reserve then there would be a
               great trouble so he stored much gold and Chinese silver. Later, the Trapchi office
               bought gold and silver and the government had quite a good store of gold and silver.
               The way of Tsarong's work in the past, in the middle period, and at present were all
                  good. Money became abundant. That's how it happened. At that
               time, a cause of the people's livelihood improving was that the Sikkim Political
               Officer Mr Guru came and his way of thinking was nice. He said, "The aristocrats of
               Tibet should become rich. If the aristocrats become rich then they will treat their
               miser well." So he gave many licenses to the aristocrats to buy Chinese silver so at
               that time much Chinese silver came to Tibet. Each license for buying silver bricks
               could get one lakh of Indian rupees as profit. As for us, he gave
               us a license to buy 200 silver bricks. We sold that and we [used the profit] to built
               the Taring House in Lhasa. [... unclear] He gave many licenses to Surkhang and
               Tsarong. The silver bricks helped a lot of people to get rich.   

**Q:**  Did they give the licenses to private people?   

**A:**  Yes. Guru Sab came to Tibet three times.   

**Q:**  At that time, did the British give parties for
               the children?   

**A:**  Yes. They gave many parties for the children.   

**Q:**  At that time were you there?   

**A:**  I was the one of main members at the parties.   

**Q:**  When they gave the party for the wives of
               aristocrats, I heard that you got there late and were unable to join the party
               because you were working on construction. Is that right?   

**A:**  Guru Sab used to give a Christmas Party for the
               children. At that time, the wife of Ringang [Tib. rin sgang] and I had to go to help
               at the party doing things like giving the presents to the children. Guru Sab used to
               bring very good quality toys. He liked to treat the children well. He invited Dromo
               Geshe Rimpoche [Tib. gro mo dge bshes rin po che], who was a very young boy then. At
               that time, he was 5 years old. When he came to the party, the servant of Rimpoche
               went to seek a blessing from him. At that time, Guru Sab said, "Why did they treat
               him like that? [... unclear]   

**Q:**  Probably, he didn't believe in Geshe Rimpoche?   

**A:**  No. It was not that he didn't have faith, but it
               was because he was a just a child.   

**Q:**  At that time, people in Kalimpong had great faith
               towards Geshe Rimpoche. The former Geshe Rimpoche was very well known. The children
               of Guru sab had very good toys.   

**Q:**  Why did he like to buy good quality toys? At that
               time, did he buy the toys or was it the government?   

**A:**  The government bought the toys, but there was a
               great diffidence in the way people worked. He was powerful and whatever he did, he
               like to do on a large scale. Guru sab was different from the other Political Officers
               of Sikkim.   

**Q:**  Do you have the book called "Lotus and Jewelry"
               which was written by Guru sab?   

**A:**  Yes, I have that.   

**Q:**  Can I borrow that book?   

**A:**  Sure. That was published after he died.   

**Q:**  Please lend me the book written by KÃ¼nsangtse
               [Tib. kun bzang rtse].   

**A:**  Sure. I will send the book. If you read his book
               then you will know that no matter whatever aim he had, he wanted to set up good
               relations with Tibetans. He thought that if he helped the aristocrats and they became
               rich, then they would treat the misers well.   

**Q:**  The main thing he did was to give licenses to the
               aristocrats so they could do business, right?   

**A:**  Yes.   

**Q:**  He also gave the licenses to Lamas, so why was
               that?   

**A:**  I think it was the same. If a labrang requested a
               license he would give it. And any important person who requested one he would give
               it.   

**Q:**  When did he give these licenses?   

**A:**  It was 1937-1938. I remember that very clearly
               because I was building the Taring House. The main expenditure for that was paid by
               the 200 silver bricks.   

**Q:**  Were there any changes after the 13th Dalai Lama
               died?   

**A:**  The 13th Dalai Lama prohibited smoking. He sent
               an edict to all the dzong and the estates.   

**Q:**  What happened in Gyantse Dzong?   

**A:**  The Gyantse Dzong sent an edict to the masses.
               There was a clerk and he said, "Now the persons who are using opium and cigarettes
               are sending the edict to those people who aren't using opium and cigarettes." Since
               the 13th Dalai Lama passed away, those prohibitions were gradually disbanded. All the
               people had great faith toward the Dalai Lama and he treated the people like parents
               do their children. So all people didn't think that he was a harsh person. In those
               days, nobody could handle Tibet. All the people were afraid of him and also they were
               happy. The discipline was very good. After the 13th Dalai Lama passed away, the
               corruption increased which was not good for the country. When there was good
               discipline, it was good for the country. During the time of the regent Taktra,
               mahjong was prohibited and all the mahjong sets were burned.   

**Q:**  It was said widely that NgabÃ¶ lost his property/
               house and his wife at mahjong, right?   

**A:**  I don't know about that. Anyhow, when the
               aristocrats played mahjong, there were great losses and great winnings. So they asked
               their partners to join the office and they were not attentive to government work and
               the work was delayed. But the 13th Dalai Lama's government offices were successful
               [Tib. tshags tshud po].   

**Q:**  Do you think there was a difference a generation
               ago during the period from 1930-1940? There are lot of aristocrats and traders doing
               a lot of trade, but a generation ago, like the time of your parents, among the
               aristocratic were they doing less trade?   

**A:**  At the time of my parents, they were really
               aristocrats and they didn't do trade. Trade had become more popular in our generation
               among the aristocrats. At the time of my parents, they were using the income they got
               from their estates only for their expenditures. They didn't do trading. If they had a
               hard time for their livelihood, they would take loans and some households had many
               loans. We didn't have large estates, so my parents had some loans to pay. After that
               Dasang DramdrÃ¼ paid all the loans.   

**Q:**  When did aristocrats start doing business?   

**A:**  The aristocrats started doing business in the
               1930s. At the time of the Second World War, they developed a road and since then many
               cigarettes and yards of cloth were sent to China. There were many traders from
               Yunnan. Since then, people started doing trade. The aristocrats and the labrang were
               doing trade and the chandzÃ¶ of the labrang were also doing trade. They made very good
               profit.   

**Q:**  Did they mainly sell Indian goods?   

**A:**  They sent dark blue jean material to China for
               making army uniforms. At that time, if a motorable road would have been opened, it
               would have been very good. But the [Tibetan Government] didn't let the road open. In
               the past, the British sent a jeep for delivering the mail from Phari to Gyantse. But
               the people of Gyantse were against that and were saying, "If you send up jeeps, you
               will stop us from making profit from transportation goods by donkey and it will harm
               the miser livelihood." So they reported this to the government and they stopped the
               jeeps. They were stopping vehicles and I don't know whether that helped or caused
               harm. But they had to transport the trade goods using horses, yaks, and mules.   

**Q:**  What about the family life? There were different
               changes on economy and people were buying more things. Were there any changes in the
               relationship between people?   

**A:**  No. The relationships between people remained as
               same as before. In some households, they had unfortunate things happen. Anyhow, the
               people's livelihood was developing and it didn't get worse. The people of Tibet love
               to eat good food.   

**Q:**  In some countries like America, things changed
               and the children didn't listen to their parents and the wives got more power. Did
               anything like this happen in Tibet?   

**A:**  No, it didn't happen like that. It remained the
               same as before. The children had great affection towards their parents. In the
               households, the elder people will act like elderly and the wife had the power inside
               the house. All of these didn't have much change, but some of the households had
               change. That was just a natural thing. The majority of people were
               good. Since people begin to do trading, the people's livelihood got better and they
               had good furniture. Therefore, Tibet was developing. Even a small household improved.
               KapshÃ¶ba was nothing in the past, but later he became very good in economics. The
               aristocratic households got much better and even their cushions were made much
               better. People were getting much more fashionable.   

**Q:**  Did they become much more fashionable after the
               13th Dalai Lama died?   

**A:**  Yes, I think it was like that. When the Dalai
               Lama was alive, people were afraid of getting scolded by the Dalai Lama if they did
               fashionable things. After the 13th Dalai Lama passed away, nobody was saying that
               they were happy that the Dalai Lama passed away, but naturally people didn't need to
               be afraid of him. So life became more elaborate.   

**Q:**  Did aristocrats go to the restaurants?   

**A:**  We regarded the people who would go to
               restaurants and teashops as pitiful and bad. There weren't any good restaurants that
               the aristocrats could go to. If you went to the restaurants and the teashops, people
               might think you didn't have a good living condition at home so you went to the
               restaurant to eat.   

**Q:**  There was a song about this that said, "If people
               eat bread it means they don't have tsamba. If people wear the hat Tsering Kyinkhab,
               it means they don't have a headdress." [Tib. bzhes bag ko kun mchod mkhan/ gsol zhib
               med pa'i rtags red/ tshering skyin khab mchod mkhan/ dbu phrug med pa'i rtags red].   

**A:**  That's true. People were singing like that.   

**Q:**  How about gambling? You mentioned mahjong. Did
               gambling become more popular after the 13th Dalai Lama died?   

**A:**  Yes, of course. It became very popular and it was
               like limitless.   

**Q:**  When did they start gambling? Was it 5-6 years
               after [the Dalai Lama died]?   

**A:**  It started gradually.   

**Q:**  Later, when people were gambling, did they use
               gold coins to gamble?   

**A:**  People wouldn't go to play mahjong if they didn't
               have 5-6 tola of gold in their pockets.   

**Q:**  It looks to me like a little bit that after the
               13th Dalai Lama died, people were more interested in getting goods and buying things
               and having fun and gambling and fooling around. At that time, did they think about
               the government?   

**A:**  I think that if someone worked sincerely and
               energetically for the government, that person himself wouldn't be successful and he
               would have some hindrances. So people were saying that it would be okay if you do
               just the regular government work and people lost their interest in that. If you
               really wanted to develop the country, they would say that you were a spy from this
               and that  and they would teach you a lesson. People were saying that
               the Prime Minister Desi Sangye Gyatso [Tib. sde srid sangs rgyas rgya mtsho] did many
               things for developing Tibet, so what happened to him? People were saying that if
               someone worked diligently for the government, they wouldn't get a good result and
               there would be many people who didn't like them. When we think
               about that, the reason why people thought like that was because of the poor education
               and shortsightedness. The main reason was the lack of education. If people were
               educated, all the people would have thoughts in unison on developing the country. We
               were lacking good schools. So the public were thinking that whatever things are
               related to the government, the government would know about it. They had great trust
               in the government. But the lords [Tib. sku ngo] of the Tibetan Government were
               playing mahjong, so what would happen? 
  

**Q:**  You are absolutely right.   

**A:**  The Tibetan people trusted the government, but
               they [the officials] were doing like that. So we lost Tibet to the Chinese. If they
               had done well, it wouldn't have been so easy for the Chinese.   

**Q:**  After the Dalai Lama died, there were two people
               who were most likely to keep changes going; KÃ¼nphel la and Lungshar, right?   

**A:**  Yes.   

**Q:**  After 1934, nobody came forward and the
               government work was just done at the minimum [Tib. 'char can]?   

**A:**  Yes, government work became not special.   

**Q:**  That's why I want to go back to Tsarong's period.
               It was very important in making changes, right?   

**A:**  At that time he did very well. Because Tsarong
               had the power and the Dalai Lama supported him, he was successful during the 14 years
               before he went to India for pilgrimage. After that, people instigated and he got
               demoted. People were saying that if someone worked sincerely for the government, then
               that person wouldn't be successful. The same thing happened to Lungshar, KÃ¼nphel la,
               and Tsarong because they were faithful to the government [Tib. gzhung sems chen po].   

**Q:**  They were mostly liberal in term of change?   

**A:**  They had been very powerful.   

**Q:**  Was Trimon [Tib. khri smon] very conservative?   

**A:**  You have judged quite well. Trimon had a high
               rank, but there was no record that he did anything helpful to the government.   

**Q:**  It was very difficult to change Tibet because
               most changes meant that monks in the monastery would have less power and as soon as
               they realized that, they would stop it. It was very difficult, right?   

**A:**  To have a change, first the people should know
               what the change would be. Otherwise, how could it work? If people didn't have
               knowledge concerning the benefit of a change and they might have to live like that
               [it is had]... I heard that when somebody told LangdÃ¼n, who was then a kalÃ¶n, that a
               plane would come to Tibet he said, "Planes cannot come to Tibet because in Tibet
               there are many high mountains which will block the plane." Some of them were saying
               that if we brought electricity into the country then the weather would get warmer.
               The people needed education and also the leaders also needed education.   

**Q:**  Once when they said that they were going to set
               up electricity in Kundeling Labrang, the dzasa said, "If you set up electricity, our
               houses will burn down." 
  

**Q:**  Do you know how old Prime Minister LangdÃ¼n was
               when he died?   

**A:**  Yes, I know. LangdÃ¼n was two years older than me.
               Just after they gouged the eyeballs of Lungshar, LangdÃ¼n resigned.   

**Q:**  I think that was in 1938, right?   

**A:**  When they gouged the eyeballs of Lungshar,
               LangdÃ¼n was there and he signed the verdict.   

**Q:**  1938 was the Earth Tiger Year. At that time, how
               old was LangdÃ¼n? What animal year were you born in?   

**A:**  I was born in the Bird Year so I am 73 years old.   

**Q:**  So it was 45 years ago.   

**A:**  LangdÃ¼n is 2 years older than me.   

**Q:**  So he might have been about 30 years old. He
               became the Prime minister in 1926.   

**A:**  I heard that he wasn't educated. 
  

**Q:**  From the Western point of view, after the Dalai
               Lama died, he was the one should have had the power?   

**A:**  Yes. Everybody says that he was a foolish person.
               He died recently. I think it was just two or three years go. He was a sweet man, but
               probably he didn't know how to think about work. After threshing was over and when
               they brought the grain home, the grain was kind of wet. When they measured the grain
               [in the bo], the number [of bo] would be high. After storing the grain in the
               storeroom, it would dry up.
