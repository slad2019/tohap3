**A:**  In the Military (Command Center) Headquarters, Tsipön Shüküpa was there.   

**Q:**  Was that the Shüküpa who is now in America?   

**A:**  Yes. After he was released he went there. And there was also Rimshi Lobsang Tsewang. While I was in the Kashag, Sitsab Lobsang Tashi and Khenjung Tara came to the Norbulinga Kashag.   

**Q:**  Where was Lukhangwa then?   

**Q:**  He had gone to India in 1957. He said he was going on a pilgrimage. Then I told Lobsang Tashila what the kalön had said about his coming and that I would serve him by making reports, etcetera. This was on the 9th. Tara and those people probably invited him to the Kashag. At this time, the Chinese broadcast amplifiers were playing loudly. They said a lot of propaganda things like, "You should control yourselves. If not, we are preparing a meal for you and we are going to serve you a Chinese radish." This implied that they were going to fire their cannons.   

**Q:**  Did you have any contact with Ngabö after this?   

**A:**  I had no contact with Ngabö. Then on the evening on the 9th, Ngabö's lay official bodyguard, his simgag, Rabgang Tashi Wangye [Tib. rab sgang bkra shis dbang rgyal] came to Norbulinga. He brought a secret letter in code for the Kashag. We told him the Kashag was in a meeting with the Dalai Lama, so he probably kept the letter. Then on the morning of the 10th at around 2-3 a.m., the shelling began. The Chinese were shelling from Nortölinga and the Gusung Regiment which was next to Norbulinga, were firing cannons back to Nortölinga. Near them was the Ngadang Regiment [Gyantse Regiment]. They were firing rifles etcetera. [Trindor: We were awoken by the noise. Everyone in our courtyard was up.] Then at almost sunrise on the 10th, at (Command Center) Headquarters, there was no other choice but to fight, right? So Shüküpa and those people [in the Command Center] told me to make an edict to all the monasteries and all the palaces, so I wrote it. In it it said, "Now the Tibetan people have risen up and are opposing the Chinese Communist Party. Now we are in the midst of our fight. So, headed by the monasteries, all the people should keep in mind that for the sake of the religion you should serve in the war and provide arms and the salary." I wrote about 15-20 of these and placed the Headquarters' seal on them.   

**Q:**  You didn't have the seal, right?   

**A:**  The Kashag's seal was taken by the kalön but the box was left there. Then I sent it out for distribution. All of this is the truth. The shelling was terrible in Norbulinga. Houses were brought down and people were killed and wounded. Every shell that went over us would still break the glass in the windows. At about 10 a.m., Khenjung Tara took a machine gun and bullets and went to Jogpori where he fought along with some soldiers [to try to recapture the hill]. After awhile, because of the shelling, all of the people were scattered. [Trindor says he had a friend on Jogpori who told him it was hopeless; that they were shelled by artillery and had a hard time to find a place to hide, let alone shoot.]   

**Q:**  What happened to the coded letter?   

**A:**  Later, Lobsang Tashi said he got it from Rabgang, and the sitsab, Tara, and I opened it and saw it was in code. We didn't have the code book, so we couldn't read it.   

**Q:**  Trindor: Earlier Ngabö had sent a real letter to the Kashag saying, "Tan Guansan has a plan to save the Dalai Lama and it would be good if you can pave the way for him. If this isn't possible, send me a map of where the Dalai Lama will be." Did you know about this?   

**A:**  I just heard that the Dalai Lama wrote a letter through the Tsenshab Gyatsoling [Tib. mtshan zhabs rgya mtsho gling].   

**Q:**  Trindor: This letter didn't reach the Kashag and it was directly delivered to the Dalai Lama, right?   

**A:**  Probably. I don't know in detail. I heard that Tan Guansan sent a letter saying, "We can't bear the responsibility if you stay like this because cannon shells have no eyes. So it is dangerous. You should go to the Military Headquarters."   

**Q:**  Trindor: On the morning of the 10th, the [Chinese] soldiers arrived, right?   

**A:**  They had not arrived at Norbulinga at that time but by about noon or 1-2 pm. on the 11th, the soldiers had taken control of Norbulinga and they arrested us.   

**Q:**  I heard that the Drepung monks saw that many riders were going towards the south of Norbulinga through the Ramagang ferry site.   

**A:**  Yes. When the Dalai Lama left he went via the south door dressed in a common chupa and went straight to the Ramagang ferry site on foot. The rest of them, the Kashag, Yabshi members and the tutors, went by car to Kündeling's new house and from there by horse. I think this was true that they saw the riders.   

**Q:**  When did Tara and those people flee?   

**A:**  Tara was there in the afternoon on the 10th, and must have fled just before the Chinese took over. Taring was taking photos at Norbulinga during the morning shelling. I saw him taking pictures of the Jensel Phodrang [Tib. spyan bsal pho brang], which was half blown up.   

**Q:**  You were unable to flee, right?   

**A:**  Yes.   

**Q:**  When you went with Lhalu to Chamdo what kind of work did you do?   

**A:**  I was staff. Then Bumtang Tsendrön Gyentsen Phüntso [Tib. rgyal mtshan phun tshogs] and I [were] in charge of the horse corvée tax [Tib. rta spyi]. After that I was sent as a salt tax collector [Tib. bal dmar tshwa sho] in an area just below Nagchuka and I worked there for about a year.   

**Q:**  When Lhalu left, the staff was left there as before, right?   

**A:**  My work had finished before that and I had been appointed as the one in charge of the Payroll Office in Sog. It was under Chamdo.   

**Q:**  The other staff people were left there, right?   

**A:**  Yes.   

**Q:**  We heard that Lhalu was enthusiastic about making war against the communists and had tried to make war plans with the heads of the Nangchen and Derge. Was this true?   

**A:**  When he was there, there was no big fighting, but there were some small skirmishes at the borders. At this time, the government had stationed many soldiers on the border like at Mankham, etc. There was no plan to go on the offensive as far as I could see, but I didn't know things in detail.   

**Q:**  You mentioned a discussion between Ngabö and Che Jigme in Beijing, what was it about?   

**A:**  I don't know in detail, but in general, one of the main issues was the property of the Panchen Lama's relatives and friends such as the Yabshi and the officials like the favorite, Jensel Lobsangla [Tib. spyan bsal blo bzang lags]. Altogether there were about 100 of those whose property had been confiscated by the Tibetan government after the Panchen Lama fled. And the Panchen Lama's father was put under detention in Norbulinga. So returning all of their things was the main issue they discussed. Then in addition to this, there was the issue of collecting the tax of one-fourth of the military's salary [Tib. dmag phogs bzhi zur]. In the past, when the Tibetan government attacked the British, Tashilhunpo had a very hard time and they had to pay one-fourth of the military's salary. At that time, the Panchen Lama said that we don't have the means to pay one-fourth of the military's salary and sent [as proof] many land tenures documents issued in the past [that exempted them from taxes]. However, in short, they imposed the military salary tax on Tashilhunpo. So it was said that the Panchen Lama went to China was to collect donations to pay the military salary. The main thing was that they [Labrang] was charging the Tibetan government compensation for the losses that they suffered. This was the internal discussion between Ngabö and Che Jigme. Finally, Labrang borrowed a little more than 40,000 dotse from the Tibetan government to be used for bringing up the Panchen Lama [from China] to Tibet. I heard that this payment was written off, but actually it was not settled.   

**Q:**  When you were in the Dalai Lama's office in Beijing, what were the contents of the secret code telegrams you sent?   

**A:**  We didn't have any important things to talk about because we were staying in the Chinese land. We were sending telegrams about the arrival of the tour groups and so on. It was supposed to be for sending information about the situation there. In the past, when they set up the Nanjing Office, they had the secret code and they were supposed to send [things] like information on Tibetan issues, but we didn't have the authority to send those things.
