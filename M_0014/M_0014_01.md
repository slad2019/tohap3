**Q:**  American Professor Dr. Goldstein and I are trying to learn about Drepung's social life and I am helping him. You were an experienced person and well educated and you were also very attentive on history. If you remember the situation in Drepung when you were there please tell us. I am not going to ask you about how to hold the classes, and how did they do teaching because those were usual thing. I like to ask in general about religious activity, about the condition of incarnate lamas, about the condition of the ordinary monks, bout the condition of the chöndze monks, and the condition about shagtsang (monk's households). I also would like to ask about monastic estates and the story of famous scholars, for example, you wrote about the Triu Kyorpon [Tib. tre hor skyor dpon]. As long as we live in the society there were many things that happened. Like how did the monastic discipline officer, the sheyngo, make decision and how did the laji make decisions. Please tell me about these things?   

**A:** 
 I don't have much things to tell you.   

**Q:**  I am sorry for asking such a long question.   

**A:**  Drepung is a very famous monastery. The main monastery of the Yellow Hat sect, the Riwo Gandenpa [Tib. ri bo dga' ldan pa], is Ganden Nampar Gyalweling [Tib. dga' ldan rnam par rgyal ba'i gling]. Under that, is Sera and Drepung. We were saying that there were three great monasteries or densa [Tib. 'dan sa] (seats). But the real densa is only Ganden Monastery. Sera and Drepung were monasteries or chöde [Tib. chos sde]. Sera and Drepung were not densa. Ganden monastery is the monastery of Tsongkhapa and his disciples. We would call Sera as Chöde Chembo Sera Thegpa Chembö Ling [Tib. chos sde chen po se ra theg pa chen po'i gling]. For Drepung, it is called Chöde Chembo Palden Drekar Pungpa [Tib. chos sde chen po dpal ldan 'bras dkar spung pa]. Tashilhunpo was called Chöde Chembo Tashilhunpo [Tib. chos sde chen po bkra shi lhun po]. As I said, Drepung Monastery is tremendous and there were more monks in it than in Sera and Ganden. The founder of Drepung Monastery wss Jamyang Chöje [Tib. 'jam dbang chos rje]. Since then, the number of the monks was increasing. At the time when the Dalai Lama took his Geshe Exam [in 1959], in Drepung there were more then 10,000 monks. It was said that in Drepung there were 7700 monks, but when they offered alms they learned that there were more then 10,000 monks. Therefore, Drepung was the biggest monastery among the three great monasteries which had been holding the debate and meditation [Tib. bshad sgrub] tradition of the Gelugpa sect. The founder of Drepung Monastery was the pupil of Tsongkapa Jamyang Chöje Tashi. He was a very well educated Lama. When he gave teachings, he would open 100 texts at the same time and give the teaching. Among the pupils of Tsongkapa, Jamyang Chöje Palden was very famous. At that time, there was only one prayer assembly hall, the Tsogchen [Tib. tshogs chen]. Later, his pupilS set up many tratsang (colleges) and Drepung came to have 7 tratsang.   

**Q:**  What is the reason for calling these tratsang?   

**A:**  That means a monk's section [Tib. tshan pa]. So there were the khamtsen and mitsen.   

**Q:**  Why were they calling one unit as tratsang and one as khamtsen and one as mitsen?   

**A:**  Tratsang means one group of monks. Among that group there were khamtsen and among the khamtsen there were mitsen.   

**Q:**  This is the way of tratsang, khamtsen and mitsen. Were there any reasons, for example why did they put khamtsen under the tratsang and why didn't they put the khamtsen before the tratsang?   

**A:**  This is because the khamtsen is the part of the tratsang.   

**Q:**  There was no other main reason?   

**A:**  No.   

**Q:**  At first, there was the tratsang and then the khamtsen was set up and became part the tratsang, right?   

**A:**  Probably it was just like that.   

**Q:**  The mitsen is set up according to where the people belonged [Tib. mi khungs], although the khamtsen also had the system of where people belonged to?   

**A:**  Yes, that's right. As I said Jamyang Chöje have many pupils and these pupils gave their teachings to groups (of monks). Therefore, the groups of monks became the tratsang.   

**Q:**  Who was the founder of the Gomang?   

**A:**  I don't remember.   

**Q:**  Do you remember who set up Loseling? Was the first text of Loseling made by Jamyang Gewai Lodrö [Tib. 'jam dbyangs dge ba'i blo gros]?   

**A:**  In the text called Jigje Chönjung [Tib. 'jigs byed chos 'byung] written by Jamyang Shepa [Tib. 'jam dbang bzhad pa], at the end of the text, there is a list of the Drepung Tripa [Tib. khri pa] called Trirab [Tib. khri rabs] and in that text I remember that it explained about how the tratsang were sit up. But I haven't read that text for a long time.   

**Q:**  Don't worry, this interview won't go outside. This is just between Mel la and me. In case somebody said that this is absolutely wrong then we might need it to prove it.   

**A:**  Yes.   

**Q:**  Did you see any thing else beside the Jigje Chonjung which wrote about the Drepung Monastery. I saw the book written by Drogmi [Tib. 'brog mi] [a lama].   

**A:**  That was a simple one, right?   

**Q:**  Yes, it was very simple.   

**A:**  I am thinking of writing the history of the three great monasteries. When I am making that history, I should make Drepung's history with the trirab, the list of the Drepung's Tripa and Sera's history with Sera's trirab and Ganden's history with Ganden's trirab. People don't know about the trirab of Drepung and Sera. They know only the trirab of Ganden. I could find the documents up to the 66th Ganden Tripa. From the 66th-96th, there were 30 tripa, and among that, only 2 tripa have biographies; one was Trichen Jangchup Chönpel [ti. khri chen byang chup chos phel] and the other was Trichen Ngawang Chönpel [Tib. khri chen ngag dbang chos 'phel]. We don't know who was 28th tripa and it is kind of pointless. But I found the 28th tripa's biography.   

**Q:**  You didn't tell me about that. Were there biographies?   

**A:**  I have every document on that. There are not many biographies, but there was a system of having double thrones. I think I have published the date of birth and death with the text called Bindurya Serpo. Do you have those that tell what he studied and how did he study?   

**Q:**  Yes, I have those.   

**A:**  I am trying to write in detail that among the tripa, some of them were tutors of the Dalai Lama and some of them gave many teachings and some them built many statues. The 15th Tripa Panchen Sonam Dragpa [Tib. bsod nams grags pa] wrote 5 volumes of text and also wrote many texts on tantras. The 22nd Tripa Gendun Tenpa Dargye [Tib. dge 'dun bstan pa dar rgyas] who wrote the text on Sera Mey. So some of the tripa wrote many texts. I wrote until the 96th Tripa in Tibet but I didn't publish it in Tibet and I took it to India. I reported this to the Dalai Lama and he said, "You should add the biography of Ling Rimpoche and the present Ganden Tripa." It is very easy to add the biography of the Ling Rimpoche because he wrote his life story. So I could add that. For the life story of the present tripa, I interviewed him and I have his life story, so only thing I have to do is proofread the ms. I tried to do that, but I had many things to do so I couldn't finish it yet. There is a complete name list of the Drepung Tripa written by Kunkyen Jamyang Shepa Ngawang Thöndub.   

**Q:**  He was the first Jamyang Shepa right?   

**A:**  He wrote completely about the Drepung tripa.   

**Q:**  He wrote up to him?   

**A:**  He didn't write about himself because he was not a tripa. He wrote until the 5th Dalai Lama. It is easy to make the tripa's list of Sera and Drepung. For example, for Drepung you can write from Jamyang Chöje to the 5th Dalai Lama. After the 5th Dalai Lama, the tripa was done by the later Dalai Lamas. The Sera Tripa started from Jamchen Chöje [Tib. byams chen chos rje] to 5th Dalai Lama. From the 5th Dalai Lama, the tripa of the Sera were the later Dalai Lamas.   

**Q:**  The Dalai Lama was considered as the tripa of Drepung and Sera, right?   

**A:**  Yes.   

**Q:**  Drepung has a separate abbot tripa, right?   

**A:**  Yes. In Sera, they also have a so called Abbot Tripa. That means the Senior Abbot known as the Khembo Tripa. That was not necessarily the senior abbot. What they did was they would change the abbot and a new abbot would come. I remember that the Gyepa [Tib. rgyas pa] abbot was the tripa when I first came to monastery and then after that he resigned, Jungnela [Tib. 'byung gnas lags] became the tripa.   

**Q:**  What is the reason that the Dalai Lamas was the Drepung Tripa?   

**A:**  The reason is eplained in Jamyang Shepa's text. It was written clearly.   

**Q:**  But not the Ganden Tripa?   

**A:**  In Ganden, they have a separate tripa. That was started from Lama Tsongkhapa. The first tripa was Je Rimpoche [Tib. rje rin po che] after that was Gyaltsab [Tib. rgyal tshab] Rimpoche. The next was Khedrub [Tib. mkhas grub] Rimpoche and then was Shaluwa Legpa Gyentsen [Tib. zha lu ba legs pa rgyal mtshan], Jamyang Tsangpa Gyunchö [Tib. 'jam dbyang gtsang pa [?]. You should write the history of Sera and Drepung.   

**Q:**  I don't know if I would be able to write Sera's history, but I will write the history of Drepung while I am studying it. I will write it in Tibetan and I will send it to you and you can make the correction for that, right?   

**A:**  About the list of the tripa of Sera, the Sera Trirab, we have to collect it from other documents. In some of the trirab, we can find where were they born and when they died, but I didn't get the detailed history of some the tripa. For example, after Jamchen Chöje went to China, for his replacement, Chöje Dargye Sangpo [Tib. chos rje dar rgyas bzang po] and I didn't find his history. After that the tripa is Gongru Gyentsen Sangpo [Tib. gung ru rgyal mtshan bzang po] and his life story is common. Sera Jetsunpa's [Tib. se ra rje btsun pa] life story is easy to find. I couldn't find some of the tripa's life story.   

**Q:**  At first give me the materials of the writing.
  

**A:**  As I said, Drepung is a very well known monastery and later it became very large. And there were also many monks.   

**Q:**  After you came to Tibet, when did you join Drepung?   

**A:**  At first I got admitted in Sera, and then I went to visit Drepung and Ganden.   

**Q:**  You went to Drepung and Ganden for pilgrimage right?   

**A:**  Yes.   

**Q:**  Do you remember at that time?   

**A:**  I remember a little.   

**Q:**  Where did you go in Drepung?   

**A:**  Actually, I was to belong to Loseling Tratsang.   

**Q:**  Your khamtsen is Tsha Khamtsen right?   

**A:**  Yes, I belonged to Tsha and Drakpa [Tib. grags pa].   

**Q:**  So you belonged to both Tsha and Drakpa both?   

**A:**  Yes.   

**Q:**  You belonged to Drakpa because you were from Markham [Tib. smar khams], right?   

**A:**  Yes.   

**Q:**  How did you belong to Tsha?   

**A:**  Some of the monks from Markham belonged to Tsha and some of them belonged to Drakpa. I belonged to both Tsha and Drakpa.   

**Q:**  That could happen?   

**A:**  Drakpa Khamtsen is quite small, but Tsha Khamtsen is big.   

**Q:**  There were not many monks right?   

**A:**  Yes.   

**Q:**  Tsha Khamtsen was one of the big khamtsen, right?   

**A:**  Yes. It belonged to the big khamtsen category, but the quality of the assembly hall was not that good. When they get alms, they had to go by lines or shakhag [Tib. bshar bkag] and it was kind of imposing and they were chanting their prayers actively [Tib. 'ur po].   

**Q:**  That was because they were a big khamtsen?   

**A:**  If the monks from Markham went to Ganden they belonged to Pukhang Khamtsen and Tsha.   

**Q:**  The monks from Markham belonged to two khamtsen and one is Tsha and one Drakpa. So was this differentiated according to the area (wihtin Markham) or the branch monastery, the shigön?   

**A:**  That was differentiated according to the branch monastery.   

**Q:**  Do you remember who was the abbot of Drepung Loseling when you came there? Probably the abbot was the Lhopa Khembo?   

**A:**  The reason why I belonged to Tsha and Drakpa is because in Kham, I was in the monastic community [Tib. skyid sdug] of Wöser ['od zer] Monastery and also in Rongphu [Tib. rong phu] Monastery. Therefore, from the side of Rongphu Monastery, I belonged to Drakpa Khamtsen. And from the side of Wöser Monastery I belonged to Tsha. In Kham I belonged to two monasteries. Therefore, in Lhasa, I belonged to two khamtsen.   

**Q:**  Why do they call you Ribur [Tib. ri sbur]?   

**A:**  That was the name of the Ribur Monastery.   

**Q:**  So was there a separate Ribur Monastery?   

**A:**  Yes, there was a separate monastery. In the past, the monastery was located on a hill so it was known as Ribur. That monastery was founded by Drongön Chögyal Phagpa [Tib. 'gro mgon chos rgyal 'phags pa]. I wrote about this in my first book. In my first book, I wrote about the labrang and the monastery because we had the historical materials. After that, the Chinese destroyed them. So I wrote it as I remembered it.   

**Q:**  Did you write about the difference between the labrang and monastery?   

**A:**  No. I wrote about the ups and downs of the labrang. At first there were very big monasteries in Markham and later there were also many labrangs in Markham. So later, our monastery went down. So I wrote about the ups and downs of the monasteries. I thought that would be useful to the next generation.   

**Q:**  In your first book, there was also your life story, right?   

**A:**  Yes.   

**Q:**  Did you remember something that happened in Drepung about the Mönlam and something about the sheyngo [Tib. zhal ngo] and the geyog [Tib. dge g.yog] or something about cases between estates? Do you remember these things?   

**A:**  We all know about the Mönlam. The Mönlam is fantastic and was found by the Je Rimpoche in Lhasa. Since the time Je Rimpoche founded the Mönlam until 1959, it has been held continuously. At some point, the leading of the Mönlam was done by Drepung.   

**Q:**  You mean to say since the 5th Dalai Lama the Mönlam was led by the Drepung, right?   

**A:**  Yes, since the 5th Dalai Lama, the study of the five volumes of dialectics had developed. On the other side, on the side of politics, even the way of wearing clothes has been changed. From when I came to Central Tibet, the clothes of the sheyngo (chief disciplinary officer) has changed a lot.   

**Q:**  How did that happen?   

**A:**  For example, the iron stick/staff called bere or jagyug [Tib. lcags rgyug] has been made bigger and bigger and more elaborated. It was not that big at the beginning.   

**Q:**  How do you spell bere?   

**A:**  I don't know. Then they made the iron stick which sounds like, "sin sin" when they stuck it on the ground. I heard that they had some kind of wires in it. In the past, when the sheyngo stuck the iron stick on the stone floor, the iron stick didn't make any sound other,"tshob tshob]. Also in the past, the ornament on the backside of the sheyngo's gown called Droglu drogden [Tib. sgrog lu sgrog gdan] used to be a thin one. Later, it was made wider and wider and they also put the design of a tiger, lion, garuda and dragon [Tib. stag seng khyung 'brug], the eight auspicious signs [Tib. bkra shis rtags brygad] and the seven royal symbols [Tib. rgyal sras sna bdun] on it. It was made so wide that the backside of the sheyngo was almost filled with those things.   

**Q:**  Later, I remember they also put the golden cross vajra [Tib. rdo rje rgya gram], right?   

**A:**  Probably, and they also made the pin for fastening their sen [Tib. sdig ra] from gold. In the past, they used to have a kind of army badge made from silver with some designs on it like a lotus flower. The sheyngo might have some gilded ones. But the chagdampa had a just silver badge. Later, I also heard they borrowed the golden badges worn on their hat. Their conduct also became very distant from the way of Viniyana [Tib. 'dul ba]. Later, the geyog would wear long hair and apply black on their faces. And they would have the stylized water bottle, chablug [Tib. chab blug], made from leather. Some of them would use red serge for the chablug.   

**Q:**  They had a green leather line on the edge of the chablug, right?   

**A:**  Yes, it also had some designs like a flower and a dog's nose. Actually, I heard that the chablug was used like a purse.   

**Q:**  The system of carrying a knife by the geyog was in the past, right?   

**A:**  In the past, I don't think they had that long sword.   

**Q:**  Were they carrying a longer knife?   

**A:**  Yes.   

**Q:**  I heard the geyog had to return their celibacy (vows) back during the Tsongjö and Mönlam?   

**A:**  I heard that also.   

**Q:**  If the geyog had to return his celibacy every year during the Tsongjö and Mönlam, then that would be more than seven times. So how would they do it?   

**A:**  If they returned their celibacy, they had to get it from the abbot [Tib. las slob] and other monks and they have to do it according for the Vinaya.   

**Q:**  I heard that they would return the celibacy, but I didn't hear that they were getting the celibacy back?   

**A:**  I don't know whether they had the vow of celibacy right from the beginning .   

**Q:**  It happened like that many times?   

**A:**  Yes.   

**Q:**  When you were in Drepung, were there any troubles about the estates? For example in Sera, the senior monks knew about the trouble at Lhundrup Dzong and nowadays the Lhundrup Dzong's trouble was written about in English in detail.   

**A:**  Was it written clearly? At that time, I was in the monastery studying pecha (religious texts).   

**Q:**  Probably in Drepung there might have happened similar situations?   

**A:**  I think so.   

**Q:**  Do you have anything to tell about that?   

**A:**  Yes, it happened like that.   

**Q:**  You know there were the monastic estates, the chöshi, and the government officials have estates and they were robbing them from each other and some of them also sold the estates. So were they allowed to sell their estate?   

**A:**  Some of them were doing like that. I don't know about that well.   

**Q:**  For example, one of the estates of the Phala [Tib. pha la] family belonged to Sumdo [Tib. sum mdo]. I think Phala sold it. Do you know about that?   

**A:**  I don't know.   

**Q:**  If a lama and his labrang got demoted then they would take away his estates. That could happen. There were also lamas offering their estates to each other, right?   

**A:**  Yes, you are right.   

**Q:**  Do you know beside that, among the tratsang, did they hand over their estates to each other?   

**A:**  The tutor to the 7th Dalai Lama Kesang Gyatso [Tib. skal bzang rgyas mtsho] called Trichen Ngawang Chöden [Tib. khri chen nga dbang mchog ldan] got Gyantse Palgön Chöde [Tib. rgyal rtse dpal mgon chos sde] as his salary estate, [Tib. thab rten]. And before he died, he said, "I don't want that. I will go to Reting. So they offered it to Reting. After that, Demo Ngawang Delek Gyatso [Tib. de mo ngag dbang bde legs rgya mtsho] got Palgön Chöde. When the Demo Labrang owned the Palgon Chöde, at the time of 8th Dalai Lama Jampel Gyasto [Tib. 'jam dpal rgya mtsho] took back Palgön Chöde from Demo Labrang and handed it over to his Yabshi [Tib. yab gzhis] (natal family). The Yabshi said that they don't want that and gave it back to the government.   

**Q:**  Do you remember anything like that during recent times when we could remember it? There were situations like Reting got demoted and the estates of Reting were owned by the government. At the time of the Lhopa Abbot, Loseling got many estates so how did they get the estates?   

**A:**  I don't remember well. After the Regent Demo, Loseling got demoted, at that time, the tsacha [Tib. tsha phyag] was expelled. At that time, I think the monastic estates also had a little bit of a problem. Later, at the time of the Lhopa abbot, they got back the estates. Probably it was like that. I am not sure whether got any new estates.   

**Q:**  Before the Lhopa abbot, one of the Deyang abbots had a misfortune; his name was Sibug [Tib. ?] abbot. Do you have anything to tell about that?   

**A:**  No, I don't know.   

**Q:**  Do you know where the Drepung tsogchen sheyngo comes from?   

**A:**  I don't know about the Drepung one. In Sera, the sheyngo would take turns by the khamtsen. But the following khamtsen: Minyag [Tib. mi nyag] Tayön [Tib. rta yon] and Gyalrong [Tib. rgyal rong] were not allowed to do the sheyngo position.   

**Q:**  Why?   

**A:**  These were the small khamtsen.   

**Q:**  In Sera, was Gyerong small?   

**A:**  No, Gyerong was not small, but in past probably, Gyerong was a mitsen of Tsha Khamtsen.   

**Q:**  So the Gyerong Khamtsen was like a mitsen that became a khamtsen right?   

**A:**  Yes. Once every 3 years or something, Ngagpa would become sheyngo. I was not attentive about that.   

**Q:**  Is the sheyngo in Sera government appointed?   

**A:**  Probably it is government appointed.   

**Q:**  It was approved [Tib. phyag rtags dgongs don] by the Dalai Lama or the regent, right?   

**A:**  Yes.   

**Q:**  I heard at the time of 13th Dalai Lama, the personal attendant of the Dalai Lama in charge of clothes, the Simpön Khembo, did the sheyngo in Drepung for 2 years?   

**A:**  That could be. In Sera Jey and Sera Mey, the gegö should be a geshe unlike in Drepung. I am sure about Ganden. Specially, they have one gegö in winter and one in summer. The summer gegö should be done by a pechawa (scholar monk) because they have to debate in the prayer assembly, (do tsoglang [Tib. tshogs langs]).   

**Q:**  In Sera they don't have the chabu and the nyertsang is the main thing, right?   

**A:**  In Sera they have the Jiso and the individual tratsang have the nyertsang.   

**Q:**  In Loseling we have the chabu and the bungdzö. The bungdzö was set up later on. They also have the nyertsang who had to supply the donggo (ritual ceremonies).   

**A:**  Yes. Does Gomang also have the same?   

**Q:**  Probably, Gomang also had chabu, but I am not sure about Deyang. Were there any other things that happened in the monastery during your life time except the Reting issue because we all know that?   

**A:**  In my first book, I wrote the main things in that book. For example, the issue of Pomda [Tib. spom da] and Gongkar Lamatshang [Tib. gong dkar bla ma tshang] who surrendered to the government. And the government gave him the rank of Khenjung.   

**Q:**  I think he did khenche at first?   

**A:**  First he was khenjung and after that he became khenche.   

**Q:**  Is it like that?   

**A:**  I am clear about this, because...
