 Li Zuomin was the director [Ch. qu zhang] of the United Front Bureau [Tib. 'thab
                    phyogs gcig gyur bu] in the Tibet Work Committee [Tib. bod las don; Ch. wei yuan
                    Tib. lhan khang]. He speaks fluent Lhasa dialect Tibetan and was the major
                    Tibetan translator for the heads of the TWC. In this interview, Li Zuoming
                    discusses the revolt launched by Chime Gompo after asking the Dalai Lama for
                    instructions. He then discusses in detail his experiences working on the Tibetan
                    Work Committee, and also the varying opinions of its members. He also describes
                    the circumstances surrounding the Dalai Lama's journey to Kalimpong and how the
                    decision was weighed. He briefly discusses the "94th Instruction" before going
                    into detail on his work as an interpreter for the Dalai Lama. Additionally, he
                    describes some of the many influences on the Dalai Lama and how they contributed

**A:**  I will tell you whatever I know.   

**Q:**  One thing that I don't know in detail is that before you went to India
                    with the Dalai Lama, in Chamdo's Jomda, [Tib. 'jo mda'] a small revolt took
                    place launched by Chime Gompo [Tib. 'chi med mgon po] and you also went there.
                    Please tell me in detail about this.   

**A:**  From the end of April to the beginning of the May in 1956, the PCTAR was
                    formally set up. At that time, there were the representatives of all the
                    counties.  Under Chamdo, there were several counties and there were ten
                    some representatives of Jomda County led by Chime Gompo. When they came to
                    Lhasa, before the meeting they had brought some gifts to be given to the Dalai
                    Lama. At that time, Lobsang Samten [Tib. blo bzang bsam gtan] was the acting
                    Jigyab Khempo, the Khentsab, [Tib. mkhan thshab] and when they went to offer the
                    gifts, the representatives told the Khentsab that they have to offer the gifts
                    and they also have to ask important questions to the Dalai Lama. Khentsab told
                    the representatives, "I will report the Dalai Lama whatever you tell me. I can't
                    say whether the Dalai Lama will give you an audience because he is busy with the
                    works of the TAR. I will ask the Dalai Lama about giving an audience, hand
                    blessing and blessing ribbons, [Tib. srung mdud].  I heard that the
                    representatives mainly have to ask the Dalai Lama to give instructions [Tib.
                    bka' slob] after the PCTAR was set up about what they should do after going back
                    to Chamdo. After two days, Lobsang Samten called the representatives and told
                    them, "The Dalai Lama said that he doesn't have time to give you the audience.
                    However, after you go back to your homeland, you can do the Khamba's way of
                    doing things [Tib. khams pa'i byed stang rang byas na 'grig gi red]." Then the
                    representatives went back.  The so called Khamba's way of doing things
                    means to carry gun and make war. By that time, the revolt in the Ganzi
                    Autonomous Prefecture, [Tib. dkar mdzes rang skyong zhou] had already taken
                    place and this is a Khamba's place.  At that time, Chamdo was regarded as
                    Kham because it is located on the east side of the Yangtse River, [Tib. 'bri
                    chu] [ed. that is incorrect]. So the representatives said that they were to do
                    the Khamba's way of doing things and they were extremely glad and went back
                    home.  At that time, the speeches given on the inauguration of the PCTAR by
                    Chen Yi, the Dalai Lama, the Panchen Lama and the the Central Committee's
                    representatives were all passed on to the counties who were told to study them.
                    At that time, in Chamdo there was the Chamdo Local People's Liberation Committee
                    [Tib. chab mdo sa khul mi dmangs bcings bkrol uyon lhan khang]. And in the
                    12 counties under Chamdo, they have the County People's Liberation Committee,
                    [Tib. rdzong mi dmangs bcings bkrol uyon lhan khang]. Chime Gompo was the
                    director, [ch zhu ren] of the Jomda County People's Liberation Committee. At
                    that time, all the members of the County People's Liberation Committee were all
                    heads [Tib. 'go pa] and there was no masses present.  So one night all of
                    them went to the mountains carrying guns and the launched the revolt saying that
                    we are doing this according to the Dalai Lama's order to do the Khamba's way of
                    doing things.   

**Q:** How many people were there when they first went up to the mountains?   

**A:** There were a little less than 30 people and they also took some masses
                    with them by force [Tib. btsan khrid]. There were 27-28 ring leaders [Tib. gte
                    po]. Among them, there was Derge Sey [Tib. sde dge sras], the son of the King of
                    Derge King and his mother Jayang Palmo [Tib. 'jam dbyangs dpal mo]. He was also
                    taken by force to be used like a flag because in the past, before the
                    liberation, Chime Gompo belonged to Jomda which was under the Derge King. So
                    Derge Sey who was about 16-17 years old, was taken as a "flag" to show that it
                    was an order from the Derge King. So this was their kind of plot.   

**Q:**  After they went to the mountains, did they make war right away or what?   

**A:** At that time, all the provisions for the PLA were transported through the
                    Kham-Tibet Highway [Tib. khams bod gzhung lam] which was also called Chuan-Tibet
                    Highway, [Ch. chuan; Tib. bod gzhung lam] and there were over 100 Liberation
                    Brand [Tib. bcings 'grol rtags can] PLA trucks driving in line with one gyashog
                    (squad of 100) of PLA troops. After the Khambas went to the mountains, they
                    ambushed the PLA trucks and cut off the highway. And they also burned many
                    highway maintenance centers.  Therefore, in August, there was the Tibet
                    Work Committee of the Communist Party [Ch. zhong gong; Tib. bod las don uyon
                    lhan khang] and the Tibet Military Command Area [Tib. bod dmag khul khang] which
                    was also under the Tibet Work Committee. And regarding politics [Tib. chab srid]
                    the PCTAR was also set up, but it did not have real political power. The main
                    work was taken care of by the Tibet Work Committee of the Communist Party. 
                    At that time, the person in charge of the Tibet Work Committee staying in Lhasa
                    was Fan Ming. So he set up a work team [Ch. gong zuo zu] whose Team Leaders [Ch.
                    zu zhang] were Ya Hanzhang who was the general secretary of the Tibet Work
                    Committee and Zhang Ziwen who was the director of the main office [Ch. ban gong
                    ting]. The director of the Public Security Office [Tib. spyi bde khang] was Song
                    Ziwen and I was the director [Ch. qu zhang] of the United Front Department of
                    the Tibet Work Committee. The four of us were told to go to Chamdo and they gave
                    us two duties: one was to win over [Tib. brtson len] Chime Gompo, etc., those
                    who went to the mountains, by educating and persuading them [Tib. go skon slob
                    gso].  The main duty was to educate and persuade the Chamdo Local Work
                    Committee of the Communist Party which was under the Tibet Work Committee to
                    lead and implement the first people's democratic reforms. Probably, they had
                    sent a letter before that said, "you have been liberated in 1950 and the offices
                    were set up in the counties. Therefore, you have good conditions (to start
                    reforms), so you should lead the people and implement the first democratic
                    reform in Tibet. But they didn't agree to do this. When we went there, when we
                    reached the Tagma la [Tib. stag ma la] mountain pass, we could hear the sound of
                    guns from the revolt launched by Chime Gompo everywhere. So we couldn't sleep,
                    [and thought] that there was no hope of winning them over by peaceful methods
                    and by telling them to put down their guns.  Then we made work assignments
                    to see whether the conditions for democratic reform have ripened, [Tib. cha
                    rkyen smin] or not. We held many meetings of the religious persons such as
                    Phagpala [Tib. 'phags pa lha] who was the main lama of the Champaling [Tib.
                    byans pa gling] Monastery and then Shiwala [Tib. zhi ba lha] and there were many
                    monks like the abbots and the gegÃ¶ also. They were all the high ranking people
                    [Tib. mtho rim mi sna]. We held round table discussions [Tib. bzhugs mol tshogs
                    'du] with about 10 people and discussed whether the conditions for the
                    democratic reforms have ripened or not. They were saying, "Leave alone the
                    condition ripening, how could we implement democratic reform when we can hear
                    gun sounds on the Tagma La Pass."  Then Zhang Ziwen, who was the director
                    of the main office of the Tibet Work Committee, but didn't know Tibetan, he held
                    meetings consisted of the cadres in the offices in Chamdo and discussed whether
                    the conditions for democratic reform have ripened or not.  Song Ziwen, who
                    is in charge of Public Security, also held meetings consisting of the police and
                    such people and discussed whether the conditions for democratic reform have
                    ripened or not.  The opinion of the three of us was that the conditions to
                    implement democratic reform had not ripened. But Ya Hanzhang, who was the team
                    leader, was saying that we can say that the conditions have ripened and we can
                    implement the reform in Chamdo first.  At that time, the team leader and
                    three other members had contradictory [Tib. rgyab 'gal] opinions. The Party
                    Secretary [Ch. shu ji] of the Chamdo Local Work Committee was Wang Qimei. He was
                    sick, poor thing! [Tib. snying rje] He had a leg problem and was lying in his
                    bed so the three of us went there and we held a meeting at which Ya Hanzhang and
                    Wang Qimei verbally fought [Tib. rgyag 'dre shor]. Ya Hanzhang was saying, "You
                    must [Tib. yin gcig min gcig] lead the people and do the first democratic
                    reforms." However, Wang Qimei was saying, "Even if you behead me, I cannot lead
                    and do democratic reforms since the conditions have not yet ripened." Since Ya
                    Hanzhang and the three of us had different opinions, we didn't say anything when
                    they were verbally fighting.  As you know, Ya Hanzhang was knowledgeable in
                    general and was especially knowledgeable about Tibet studies. He had written
                    many things, and he was also very tough person [Tib. mkhregs po]. He said in
                    Chinese, "Do not hide your illness and not go to see the doctor" [Ch. bu yao hui
                    ji ji]. [Tib. na tsha gsang nas em chi mi bsten pa]. He meant one should not
                    hide one's errors and should not let the person die. So Wang Qimei being a
                    soldier, was very agitated and said, "My sickness is at the point of death and
                    you, the skillful doctor, come to treat me." Like this, they fought verbally and
                    all of us had a red face [Tib. gdong dmar po chags] and didn't say anything and
                    then returned to our residences.  Wang Qimei was angry and on the next day
                    he called the meeting of all the cadres such as the directors in the Local Work
                    Committee and he attended the meeting using a cane. Wang Qimei told the cadres
                    to tell their opinions about whether the conditions for democratic reforms have
                    ripened or not. The cadres told their opinions and finally there was nobody
                    agreeing to do the reforms.  So Ya Hanzhang was angry and didn't have
                    anything he couldf do so he just wrote a report. Since he was a scholar, he
                    drafted the report and read it at the big meeting, but they didn't agree to it.
                    Then Ya Hanzhang told the three members of our work team that he is going to
                    submit the report to the Tibet Work Committee of the TAR in the name of the work
                    team members. The point of the report was that the conditions for doing
                    democratic reforms first in Chamdo have ripened. But then the three of us said
                    that if this is the point of the report, then we are not going put our names on
                    it and we don't agree to it. You can submit the report in your name only.
                    Finally, he sent a telegram in his own name. So we didn't have work to do
                    because we couldn't win over the people launching the revolt. All the cadres
                    including the three of us didn't agree and then we were called back to Lhasa.
                     The main point is that I could witness or prove [Tib. dpang po] what the
                    Dalai Lama told Chime Gompo. Two days before our departure from Chamdo, a work
                    team led by NgabÃ¶ Ngawang Jigme [Tib. nga phod ngag dbang 'jigs med] who
                    represented the TAR arrived in Chamdo. At that time, NgabÃ¶ was the UyÃ¶n
                    (Committee member) of the Standing Committee and the General Secretary [Tib.
                    drung yog chen mo] of the PCTAR. NgabÃ¶ got the order from Fan Ming and in the
                    name of the PCTAR he led the team. His work team's duty was as same as us, that
                    is, to win over the people launching revolt and to do the democratic reforms.
                     Since I speak fluent Tibetan and I also had good relation with NgabÃ¶, so
                    the three of us work team members told Ya Hanzhang that we are going to see
                    NgabÃ¶. Ya Hanzhang agreed so we went to see NgabÃ¶. At that time, Ya Hanzhang
                    just shook hands with NgabÃ¶ and did the normal kind of greetings and then he
                    went back but the three of us stayed there. Then NgabÃ¶ asked me, "How is the
                    situation here?" So I told NgabÃ¶, "There is no hope of winning over those people
                    and regarding doing democratic reforms, leave alone the masses, even among the
                    cadres there is nobody agreeing to it." NgabÃ¶ and I being old friends, we talk
                    straightforwardly and never hide anything when we talk. So NgabÃ¶ told me, "This
                    work is difficult, so you should do it well." And I said yes. After about 10
                    days, NgabÃ¶ returned to Lhasa.  Later, one day when I went to see NgabÃ¶ in
                    Lhasa, regarding the Dalai Lama, he was told a very important thing. NgabÃ¶ being
                    a Tibetan and having been the Doji [Tib. mdo spyi] KalÃ¶n (Governor General) in
                    1950 and when Chamdo was liberated he was arrested, he had many relations with
                    the heads of the monasteries in Kham. So he told me that he called about 100
                    people who were the heads of the counties and held a meeting and explained them
                    ( the issues). After that when he was taking a rest, one person came to him
                    surreptitiously and said, "What you said is just empty words. You cannot make
                    the people revolting put down their guns and surrender because the root is deep
                    and I have a secret to tell you." After the meeting, NgabÃ¶ called that person
                    who was the vice county leader of PagshÃ¶ [Tib. dpa' shod]. Probably, he had
                    close relations with NgabÃ¶ and was a reliable and trustworthy person. He told
                    NgabÃ¶, "Chime Gompo went to the mountains and launched the revolt in accordance
                    with the order from the Dalai Lama. So it is impossible for you to educate them
                    to put down their guns and surrender. So this matched with what Lobsang Samten
                    said at that time. Later NgabÃ¶ himself wrote this in his memoir [Ch. hui yi lu]
                    which is not yet distributed [Tib. bkram].   

**Q:** This is strange, regardless of whether it was said by the Dalai Lama
                    himself or by Lobsang Samten.   

**A:** NgabÃ¶ told me that before he left for Chamdo, he went to the Dalai Lama
                    and told him that he is going to Chamdo in the name of the work team of the TAR
                    to win over Chime Gompo, etc. and that he also told the Dalai Lama, "maybe it
                    will be good if you could write a handwritten letter to Chime Gompo telling him
                    to put down the guns". The Dalai Lama agreed to write the letter, but then he
                    said, "I will write the letter, but I am afraid this letter will not be helpful"
                    [Tib. phan thogs a yong].  Then NgabÃ¶ also told me, "I told the Dalai Lama
                    what I heard from a person about what Lobsang Samten had said as if it was true
                    [Tib. dngos gnas yin pa nang bzhin] and I asked the Dalai Lama how did that
                    happen? And the Dalai Lama told me, "It's too bad. That person is reckless! I am
                    going to enquire about this [Tib. a kha mi 'di gang byung mang byung/ ngas nyin
                    ma gcig rtsad gcod kyi yin].   

**Q:** Did he mean Lobsang Samten is reckless?   

**A:** Yes. NgabÃ¶ told me, "Later, whether this matter was enquired about or
                    not, not a word was heard about it. [Tib. 'jam thing nger bzhags song]   

**Q:** Later, how could Chime Gompo get through this?   

**A:** He was killed when they quelled the revolt.   

**Q:** Was this in 1956?   

**A:** No. It was later when the widespread revolt took place. Chime Gompo and
                    another person called something Gompo were both killed on the battlefield.
                    Probably, this was at the end of 1958.   

**Q:** Did they remain in mountains for about 2 years?   

**A:** After the widespread revolt took place in Markham [Tib. smar khams] and
                    Dzogang [Tib. mdzo sgang] and the PLA quelled the revolt, Chime Gompo was killed
                    when they scattered. Later Derge Sey Okar, who was taken by force to the
                    mountains by Chime Gompo, was released by means taken by his mother Jayang Palmo
                    and he returned back.   

**Q:** Did Chime Gompo have relations with the Khambas who launched the revolt
                    on the other side of the Yangtse like those in Lithang and the Bathang?   

**A:** Yes, they had relations. Later, the Derge King and another head leader
                    [Tib. 'go pa] of Derge united with Chime Gompo and the revolt on the east and
                    west side became united.   

**Q:** When you and the Dalai Lama were in India, at one point it was not
                    decided whether the Dalai Lama would stay in India or return to Tibet. At that
                    time, what was the thinking among the cadres of the government on this matter
                    and what were you talking about in case the Dalai Lama stayed there; what were
                    you going to do?   

**A:**  At that time, Zhou Enlai talked with the Dalai Lama three times. And
                    there was a leading team among the entourage [Tib. chibs zhabs tsogs chung] that
                    consisted of 6-7 people like the KalÃ¶n NgabÃ¶, Ragashag [Tib. rags kha shag],
                    Jigyab Khembo Gadrang [Tib. dga' brang] and Phala Thubten WÃ¶nden [Tib. pha lha
                    thub bstan 'od ldan]. The team leader was NgabÃ¶. As for our thinking, before the
                    Dalai Lama left for India, the main principle of the policy work line, [Tib.
                    byed phyogs srid jus kyi rtsa don] was confirmed. At that time, Nehru sent the
                    invitation to the Dalai Lama and the Panchen Lama inviting them to the Buddha
                    Jayanti.   

**Q:** Did they send the invitation to the Central Committee?   

**A:** Yes and the principle of the work line [Ch. fang zhen yuan ze] of the
                    Central Committee for making this decision was a very important one. I delivered
                    the message to them which said that the Dalai Lama and the Panchen Lama should
                    make the decision whether or not to go and that the Central Committee does not
                    have any opinion about this. If you decided to go, Zhongyang will not send any
                    cadres because both of them are state leaders. At that time, the Dalai Lama was
                    the Vice Chairman of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress,
                    [Tib. rgyal yongs mi dmangs 'thus mi tshogs chen rgyun las uyon lhan khang gi
                    uyon zhang gzhon pa] and the Panchen Lama was the Vice Chairman of the National
                    Political Consultative Congress, [Tib. rgyal yongs chab srid gros tshogs kyi kru
                    zhi gzhon pa].  And Zhongyang also said that we trust both of them so the
                    two of them can decide correctly whatever kind of political matters arise. In
                    case, the two of you have any kind of problem, we will give orders to our
                    embassy and you can request whatever you want/need them to do. This was the
                    principle.  Then both of them said that they are going, so the TAR and the
                    Tibet Work Committee made the preparations for them. When we arrived India, the
                    cadres of the Chinese Embassy in Delhi, in accordance with Zhongyang's
                    instructions, they did not meddle in this matter. However, internally there were
                    some discussion about what to do if they say that they want independence or if
                    they say that they are not going back. Regarding this, it was decided to act
                    according to Zhou Enlai's talks.  Zhou Enlai educated and persuaded the
                    Dalai Lama. His main point to the Dalai Lama was, "even you are a state leader;
                    you still have the nature of being a deity [Tib. lha]. So if the deity remains
                    in the temple, it has the grandeur of being a deity and you will have the
                    strength of a deity, but if the deity departs the temple, then you will lose the
                    strength of a deity. If you stay in India, your temple is in Tibet and you
                    cannot move it to India. If you stay in India, you will be in political exile,
                    [Tib. chab sris kyi yul gyar]. (He said that) Nehru told me clearly, that you
                    (the Dalai Lama) are not allowed to do any activities to oppose the PRC. So if
                    you stay in India, you cannot do any political work". This is what Zhou Enlai
                    told the Dalai Lama.  At that time, the Dalai Lama insisted that he wants
                    to go to Kalimpong. Just before that, Zhou Enlai had spoken to the Dalai Lama
                    about this (Kalimpong). When Nehru was talking with Zhou Enlai, Nehru had told
                    Zhou Enlai, "Kalimpong is the place where all the spies of the world gather. On
                    this, we, the Indian Government don't have anything we can do. Therefore, Zhou
                    Enlai told the Dalai Lama, "It is very dangerous if you go to Kalimpong because
                    Nehru told me that Kalimpong is the place where all the spies of the world
                    gather. On this, we, the Indian Government don't have anything we can do. So you
                    should think about it carefully. [laughter]   

**Q:** When he was going to Kalimpong, it had been decided that he (the Dalai
                    Lama) will go back to Tibet. Before that, it was not confirmed whether he will
                    go back or not because there were the people like Jenkhentsisum. So after an
                    awhile, did the Dalai Lama tell you cadres that he is going back? Did he say
                    that he wants to go via Kalimpong?   

**A:**  Yes, he told me this. Before that, the Dalai Lama went for for a
                    pilgrimage and tour for about 2 months during which time the separatists like
                    Gyalo Thondub [Tib. rgya lo don grub], Taktser Norbu [Tib. stag 'tsher nor bu],
                    Shakabpa [Tib. zhwa sgab pa], Lobsang Gyentsen and Alo ChÃ¶ndze were with the
                    Dalai Lama all the time, so they told the Dalai Lama very clearly that this is a
                    good opportunity, so he should stay in India and lead the movement for Tibetan
                    independence and do something to accomplish this goal. So at that time, the all
                    the members of the entourage of the Dalai Lama including the servants were
                    mentally very disturbed. Among these people, NgabÃ¶ was the most stable [Tib.
                    brtan shos], but since he was just one person, it was hard to do anything. 
                    Then Zhou Enlai, in accordance with the opinion of the Dalai Lama, talked with
                    the Shape. At that time, the Dalai Lama had asked Zhou Enlai to tell the Shapes
                    about the disadvantages or harm [Tib. skyon dang gnod pa] that would accrue if
                    he stayed in India and about the advantages [Tib. dge mtshan] if he returned to
                    Tibet. Then Zhou Enlai, in accordance with the request of the Dalai Lama, called
                    a meeting in the Chinese Embassy in Delhi and called the six (leading) people
                    and told them that the Dalai Lama requested him to tell them the advantages and
                    the disadvantages and what kind of situation will occur if he stayed in India
                    and also about the advantages if he return. NgabÃ¶ was the team leader of the
                    entourage that included Surkhang. Ragashag [Tib. rags kha shag] and the Talama
                    Jogtang [Tib. ta la ma lcogs steng]. He talked with them one by one in detail
                    and told them, "What are you going to do? Among us internally, the situation is
                    chaos [Tib. zang ngi zing ngi]. If you are still doing chaotic things, I am
                    going back. In short, what are you thinking? Are you going to stay in India or
                    go back?   

**Q:**  When NgabÃ¶ talked with the Shapes, was Zhou Enlai there?   

**A:** No.   

**Q:** Zhou Enlai talked about the advantages and the disadvantages and then he
                    went back, right?   

**A:** Yes. Then NgabÃ¶ called all the members of the entourage and all of them
                    propitiated the deities [Tib. lha gsol btang] and swore that we will have
                    solidarity [Tib. rdog rtsa gcig sgril] and we will not do reckless things and we
                    will not listen to whatever the separatists tell us and we are going back. 
                    At that time, the Dalai Lama had said that he is going back, but he was not
                    thinking like that in his mind, [Tib. bsam blo'i sbug la de 'dra ma red]. And
                    then he went to Kalimpong. In Kalimpong he had some strange underground [Tib. sa
                    'og] friends. It was said that NgabÃ¶, in any case, [Tib. yin gcig min gcig] had
                    to go to Kalimpong. Kalimpong and Sikkim are located in the mountain areas and
                    the road was zigzag and narrow. At that time, they had an internal plan to
                    assassinate NgabÃ¶ by making a car collision. But they had to see where and when
                    they will do it.  When NgabÃ¶ arrived Kalimpong, he learned about this plot
                    and tried to go back to Tibet first [before the others]. At that time, NgabÃ¶'s
                    wife Tseten DrÃ¶lkar [Tib. tshe brtan sgrol dkar] was pregnant with her last
                    child called Chime [Tib. 'chi med ], so she sent a telegram through the post
                    office saying that her life is in danger because she has a hard time giving
                    birth so NgabÃ¶ should return immediately. So NgabÃ¶ took the telegram and went to
                    ask for leave from the Dalai Lama. By that time, the air route from Siliguri to
                    the Dam [Tib. 'dam] Airport [north of Lhasa] was open, so NgabÃ¶ went to Siliguri
                    Airport from Kalimpong. The plan for sending our government plane to receive
                    NgabÃ¶ was set up and for security purposes, I spread talk in Kalimpong saying
                    that NgabÃ¶ is going to leave Kalimpong at 3 am on the next morning. Internally,
                    it was decided to leave at 1 a.m. and he did leave at that time. We did this
                    because there was a plot of assassination. I also told NgabÃ¶ that he should tell
                    the entourages that he is leaving Kalimpong at 3 a.m.   

**Q:** Did NgabÃ¶ go back with the Panchen Lama?   

**A:** No. They left separately. The Panchen Lama had already left. After they
                    arrived India the Dalai Lama did something unprecedented and went to visit the
                    Panchen Lama and told him, "This time, if the two of us could go to Kalimpong
                    together and give dharma teachings and hand blessings to the 30,000 Tibetans
                    living there it would be good. However, the Panchen Lama disagreed and said,
                    "What ever you say, I am not going to Kalimpong. According to my thinking, it is
                    the best to send telegram to the zhongyang and tell them to send a plane to
                    Kolcutta and then we go back to Beijing and report to the Central Committee what
                    we did in India."  But the Dalai Lama wouldn't agree, right? So the Panchen
                    Lama said, "If so you go there. I am not coming and I have only one opinion to
                    tell you. Please take care of yourself. It is dangerous there." Then after two
                    days, the Panchen Lama told me this and he left from Siliguri airport.  I
                    was not sent as a cadre by the Central Committee to accompany the Dalai Lama. On
                    the 19th of November in 1956, the Central Committee representative [Zhang
                    Jingwu] gave an elaborated farewell party in the hall of the Yabshi family.
                    There were about 3-4 tables where there were the entourage officials above the
                    5th rank and there were also the Chinese cadres; and I was there as the
                    interpreter seatting at the first table there the Dalai Lama, Zhang Jingwu,
                    NgabÃ¶ Surkhang, the Dalai Lama's mother and Lobsang Samten were sitting. Then
                    Zhang Jingwu all of a sudden told the Dalai Lama, "I received a telegram from
                    the Central Committee just before I attended the meeting saying that while you
                    will be in India for the pilgrimage and tour, Premier Zhou Enlai is going to
                    visit Pakistan and Nepal and he will come to Delhi either from Pakistan or Nepal
                    and probably he will meet you people. So the Central Committee suggests that you
                    take an interpreter mainly to interpret Chinese into Tibetan. The Central
                    Committee has no objection whoever you are want to take with you. So the Dalai
                    Lama pointed to me with his chopstick and said, "How could there be a better
                    interpreter than him. So I will take him." So it was decided right away; the
                    Dalai Lama was going to leave the next day.  Zhang Jingwu then told Yang
                    Papa, the person in charge of the Foreign Office, to make a passport for Comrade
                    Li Zuoming to go to the India. At that time, I didn't have a photo for the
                    passport, so the photographer from the Xinhua News Agency who was at the party
                    was told to take a one hour photo. At that time, it was snowing on the NathÃ¶ La
                    mountain pass (to Tibet) and in India the weather is hot, so I had to prepare
                    clothing both for winter and summer. Yang Papa gave me the passport at 2.a.m and
                    I left like this.  After the Dalai Lama had finished his formal scheduled
                    events, he stayed 15 days in the Sikkim Palace. This also had a plot. They were
                    saying as a pretext that the NathÃ¶ la is covered by snow. This is what they told
                    me and said externally. Internally, they sent a person secretly [to Lhasa] and
                    told people there to launch a disturbance [Tib. zing] in Lhasa since if there
                    would be a disturbance no matter if it is big or small, they would be able to
                    use this as a pretext for the Dalai Lama to not to go back. So he waited for
                    this for 15 days. But they couldn't launch the disturbance.   

**Q:** Did this person arrive at Lhasa?   

**A:** Yes, we also arrested 2-3 people. When the Dalai Lama was staying in the
                    Sikkim Palace, he gave me the order to come to him every morning. So I went to
                    see him for 2-3 days and then every morning, he said, "hayoo! It is difficult.
                    [Tib. ha yu khag po 'dug ga]. So on the third day I told him, "If you have the
                    same one word to tell me everyday, from tomorrow, I am not coming." But he told
                    me, "please come. I had to say that on these days." [Tib. skabs mtshams la de
                    'dra zhu dgos byung song].   

**Q:** When you held the meeting with Phala and Gyalo, etc., did Shakabpa come
                    there?   

**A:** They came to Mumbai and the situation became strange. At that time, all
                    the members of the entourage led by NgabÃ¶ had solidarity, so there was the
                    danger that their plot to stay in India and work for Tibetan independence will
                    be destroyed [Tib. 'thor].   

**Q:** When they came to Mumbai, was it before or after, Zhou Enlai's visit?   

**A:** It was after that. At first, Zhou Enlai delivered a message to the Dalai
                    Lama and the Panchen Lama and requested them to go with him to Nepal. This is
                    because Lumbini in Nepal is the birthplace of the Buddha. I was not there when
                    he said that. That was probably told through the embassy and the Panchen Lama
                    agreed right away. The Dalai Lama first agreed, but later Gyalo Thondub and
                    Shakabpa learned about that and they opposed it so the Dalai Lama changed his
                    mind. But he didn't dare to tell Zhou Enlai and probably he told NgabÃ¶ to report
                    about that. I am not sure about this. At that time, wherever the Dalai Lama
                    went, Tagtser Norbu, Gyalo Thondub and Shakabpa would stay in a place near by.
                    When they were in Mumbai, they told NgabÃ¶ to come to their residernce saying
                    that they have an important thing to tell him. NgabÃ¶, being a member of the
                    entourage, was staying in the residence that was arranged by the Indian
                    Government.  NgabÃ¶ being a thoughtful person, after he made the members of
                    the entourage agree to solidarity, he was alert that they might do something bad
                    to him so he would always stay with Ragashag in the same room. So when they
                    called NgabÃ¶ to the meeting, NgabÃ¶ told Ragashag, "I am going there. If I don't
                    come back tonight, you enquire to the three of them. Maybe, I would have been
                    killed and or maybe I would have been kidnapped."  NgabÃ¶ told me that he
                    went there and they had prepared elaborate fruits, sweets and tea etc and then
                    NgabÃ¶ told them. "I am neither going to eat or drink your fruits, nor I am going
                    serve these things when you come to me. In case the fruits and the tea are
                    poisoned or if there would be some problem after eating them, then it will be
                    not good for all of us. So you tell me what you are going to tell me. Then they
                    told NgabÃ¶, "We apologize to you Sawangchemmo. We are in a very difficult
                    situation because the Dalai Lama was told to go to Nepal and he might have
                    agreed. So you are the only person who can stop him from going and please also
                    help us to stay in India and work on the Tibetan Independence."   

**Q:** Did they openly say that to him?   

**A:** Yes. Then NgabÃ¶ said, "The Dalai Lama himself have made the decision to
                    go to Nepal, so how can I, a member of the entourage, tell him not to go?
                    According to the Tibetan traditional system, do we have this kind of system? You
                    think about this because we are Tibetans. Regarding staying in India and working
                    for Tibetan independence, this will also be decided by the Dalai Lama himself.
                    If we tell him to do this and that, won't he become a puppet [Tib. gsang thag
                    'then yul]. This is nonsense! [Tib. snang ba mi 'gro ba'i shad cha]. I am not
                    going to do this".   

**Q:** Did NgabÃ¶ ask Shakabpa whether they had the support from India and the
                    US?   

**A:** Yes, he told them, "If you stay in India, what kind of benefits are there
                    [Tib. phan thogs] and who has agreed to help you." To this, Shakabpa said that
                    they have confidence [it will come], so NgabÃ¶ told him, "if you have confidence,
                    bring it to me and I will take it and tell the other members of the entourage."
                    They told NgabÃ¶ that it is hard to show it right away. Then NgabÃ¶ said, "If you
                    just verbally talk like blowing wind. I am not going to trust you. This is
                    true."   

**Q:** Another thing that I don't understand is that you told me that in India,
                    Zhou Enlai delivered a letter from Mao Zedong to the Dalai Lama which said that
                    the reforms will be postponed for 6 years, but later I found in some Chinese
                    documents that after Fan Ming did the experimental reforms in places like TÃ¶lung
                    [Tib. stod lung], in September 1956, the Central Committee sent a telegram or
                    letter to Fan Ming telling him to postpone the reforms, but he didn't inform the
                    Dalai Lama about this. I think that if he had informed the Dalai Lama, the Dalai
                    Lama's mind/attitude would have become better. So why didn't they inform the
                    Dalai Lama then?   

**A:** This document was called the "94th Instruction", [Tib. dgu bzhi mdzub
                    ston]. After they set up the PCTAR, in June 1956, Zhang Jingwu and the zhongyang
                    representatives returned to Beijing. At that time, Zhang Guohua was not healthy
                    and had gone to take a rest and Tan Guansan was also not there. Anyway, among
                    the 4 party secretaries and vice party secretaries, three were absent and Fan
                    Ming was alone.  Since the end of the May, they started to do the so called
                    the preparatory work for the democratic reforms and they caused the
                    disturbances. [Tib. zing langs]. It was said that we need many Tibetan cadres
                    and from May to June-July, the offices themselves collected people from the
                    society in a casual manner saying that they are for the purpose of becoming
                    cadres. They decided to pay 3 dayang per month and the office would take care of
                    their residence, food, etc. Later they hustled to get people and the pay was
                    increased to pay 5 dayang per month.  At that time, I was not high ranking,
                    but was just a director [Ch. qu zhang] of the United Front Office; I was able to
                    get 7 people; 4 boys and the 3 girls who were like 13-14 years old. I pitched a
                    tent for them in the park and gave them good food and 3 dayang per month. After
                    2-3 days, three of them were lost. When I told them why didn't you tell me if
                    you are going home? It is not good to sneak away, they told me, "This is not the
                    case. Another office is paying 2 dayang more." When I enquired about this I came
                    to know that they were taken by the Communist Youth League [Tib. gung gzhon sde
                    tshogs] of the PCTAR which had a Lhasa Muslim cadre called Ma Bojian. Ma Bojian
                    spoke Tibetan fluently and had good relations with the kudrak and he also had
                    taken boys and girls from some other offices. [laughter] Secondly, the revolt in
                    Chamdo had taken place and the situation was in chaos. So the Central Committee
                    issued the "94 Instructions", and instructed that the preparatory work for the
                    democratic reforms be stopped. However, the 6 years postponement was not
                    confirmed and it was not spread externally; and it was just an internal matter.
                    So I think that was the reason for not telling the Dalai Lama and the Panchen
                    Lama. And another reason is that Fan Ming did it on his own without the the
                    Central Committee's instructions.  Regarding the letter from Mao Zedong to
                    Zhou Enlai, it was confirmed in November 1956 when there was a Tibetan
                    Government tour group led by Sambo Tsewang Rinzin [Tib. bsam pho tshe dbang rig
                    'dzin] that came to Beijing. Chairman Mao met them and later they came to
                    Shanghai. At that time, Mao Zedong held a Supreme State Conference [Ch. zui gao
                    guo wu hui yi] [Tib. ches mtho'i rgyal don tshogs chen]. They could only hold
                    this meeting several times. At this meeting, Mao Zedong gave a speech and later
                    it was published in a book titled, "Regarding correctly settling the
                    contradictions within the people" [Tib. mi dmangs nang khul gyi 'gal ba yang dag
                    pa'i sgo nas thag gcod bya rgyu'i skor].  At that time, he didn't say to
                    postpone the reform for 6 years. He said, "From now on during the 3rd five year
                    plan, we will not do the reforms in Tibet." This was exactly 6 years.   

**Q:** What is the difference between the "94" instruction and this speech of
                    Mao Zedong?   

**A:** In the "94" instruction, it was written that the condition is not ripe,
                    therefore, stop the preparatory work for the reforms.   

**Q:**  So Fan Ming still did that continuously, right?   

**A:** No. He didn't.   

**Q:**  I talked with Serdrong Wangyal [Tib. gser grong dbang rgyal] and he told
                    me that they did the experimental reforms on his estate in TÃ¶lung in November.   

**A:** The Central Committee document was passed down in September, but the
                    conclusion was delayed till end of the year. Among about 3,000 people who were
                    recruited to be cadres, there were also prostitutes, thieves, and Khambas who
                    were wandering in Kham. When they differentiated these people, they couldn't be
                    expelled, so they were sent to study in China. So because of this conclusion, it
                    was delayed till the end of the year. Then from 1957, the Central Committee
                    started the great curtailing, [Tib. khu bsdu chen po].   

**Q:** What I heard was that Fan Ming also brought several thousands of Han
                    people from Ganzi, Gansu and Qinghai, etc. Was that true?   

**A:** Yes this is true.   

**Q:** How could he get such a power?   

**A:** Oh! He was a very audacious, [Tib. ham pa chen po] person, so it didn't
                    matter whether he had the power or not.   

**Q:** If the Central Committee's policy is good and if the people implement it,
                    then it will be good. Before the Dalai Lama went to India, he had the idea of
                    staying in India and one reason for this was the events in Sichuan and another
                    reason was that when they did the trial democratic reform it caused him to feel
                    frightened. So I think this was a big mistake, right?   

**Q:** The situation was like this because in 1955 when the Dalai Lama was in
                    China, he made a great accomplishment when the State Council adopted the
                    resolution to set up the PCTAR. After that, in the beginning of May, when he was
                    going back to Tibet and went to Sichuan there was the earthquake and he had to
                    stay about a half month in Chengdu. Then when he reached Dartsedo, I am not sure
                    what the Dalai Lama was thinking then because I was in Beijing working as a
                    clerk for Zhang Jingwu. But the events from then happened. [Tib. de dus kyi gnas
                    tshul da lta chags yod red] For example, at that time, the masses, especially
                    those in the southern part (of Kham) requested the Dalai Lama to come to Kham
                    and give dharma teaching and hand blessings. They did that very strongly by
                    sending people to Beijing. So when the Dalai Lama reached Dartsedo, he sent two
                    persons, Trijang Lobsang Yeshe [Tib. khri byang blo bzang ye shes] who was the
                    junior tutor and himelf had been born in Chantreng. So it was decided that
                    Trijang will take some people and go to the south, while the 16th Karmapa RÃ¶lpey
                    Dorje [Tib. rol pa'i rdo rje] will take some people and go through the north
                    route in Kham and Surkhang Wangchen Gelek [Tib. dbang chen dge legs] was as sent
                    his partner. They were sent as the representatives of the Dalai Lama to satisfy
                    the people wish by giving dharma teachings. This became a strange situation. And
                    when they implemented the democratic reforms in Kham, the revolt took place in
                    the southern area and also in the northern area. After the revolt was quelled,
                    they found a letter from the battlefields that had been sent by Trijang giving
                    instructions to the heads of the southern Kham area telling them to carry guns
                    and oppose the democratic reforms. We have that letter.   

**Q:** Who wrote the letter?   

**A:** It was written by Trijang. Although I didn't see the letter, they said it
                    was written in Tibetan. So there is proof to say that the Trijang was the person
                    who moved the puppets to launch the revolt in Kham.   

**Q:** In this letter, was it written that if they do the democratic reforms,
                    then you should carry guns and oppose it?   

**A:** Yes. It was written that you should carry guns and oppose it. Therefore,
                    Zhou Enlai or someone from the Central Committee gave a hint to the Dalai Lama
                    saying that root of the revolt in Kham is something strange. At that time, when
                    the revolt in Ganzi took place, Zhou Enlai told the Dalai Lama, "If you send a
                    delegation [to investigate the uprising in Kham) [Tib. sku tshab tshogs pa], we
                    will support you." This is the reason for saying that.  In Ganzi, after the
                    revolt was quelled, according to the custom of the PRC we would do an exhibition
                    to show the proof. I heard that the above mentioned letter was displayed there.   

**Q:** After you people returned to Lhasa what was the situation then in 1957?
                    Then Zhang Guohua came from Beijing, right? Anyway the situation became worse
                    since 1957, right?   

**A:** Yes.   

**Q:** Why?   

**A:** On the 24th November 1956, we arrived at Gangtok in Sikkim and (on the
                    return trip), the Dalai Lama arrived at Tromo on the 7th of February. From Tromo
                    to Lhasa, the situation was very strange. As I was the interpreter taken by the
                    Dalai Lama so I had to write a report about my trip. So I got good time to write
                    this on the way from Tromo to Shigatse because from Tromo to Lhasa, I didn't
                    have any work because the Dalai Lama was giving dharma teachings and hand
                    blessings.   

**Q:** You were like an ula, right?   

**A:** Yes. When I arrived in Shigatse, I found that probably there was a little
                    less than 20, 000 characters (in my report). I wrote things that happened and I
                    also wrote my analysis. Then in Shigatse, I told the Branch Work Committee, [Ch.
                    fen gung wei; Tib. yan lag las don uyon lhang kgang] to print about 10 copies of
                    this and I took these to Lhasa.  On the way, the Dalai Lama gave many
                    dharma teachings and especially, he gave the Kala Chakra Initiation in Lhasa.
                    You think about the purpose of him giving these teachings because you are expert
                    on religion and those things.  After he arrived Lhasa, I found that his
                    mind was no more natural and have changed [Tib. g.yo 'gul thebs] and he had
                    become uncertain [Tib. ldang ngi lding nge]. He was suspicious about the Central
                    Committee thinking that maybe it is the not the right way to be close to the
                    Cenral Committee and to have Tibet united with the motherland. Since his mind
                    had changed, he should have a plan, right?  I think the Dalai Lama didn't
                    trust that Tibet will be independent, although the people in India had told him
                    that. But I found he had been veery influenced by the Indian democracy and
                    especially by Gandhi's non-violence idea. The Dalai Lama wouldn't tell me about
                    Tibetan Independence, but he told me very strongly about these two things. 
                    For example, I will tell you a story. One day, we went for a tour to the upper
                    and the lower Indian Parliaments which was officially arranged by the office. In
                    the offices, the glass ink pots on the tables were stuck to the table. So the
                    Dalai Lama asked Nehru, "What is the reason for keeping the ink pots stuck to
                    the table? Nehru said, "If we don't make the ink pots stuck to the table,
                    sometimes the members of the parliament would fight when they discuss issues and
                    when they get angry they might hit each other with the ink pots. If they did so,
                    the office will be filled with blue ink." The Dalai Lama was glad and said,
                    "This is the real system of the democracy."  On another day, we also went
                    for a tour, this time to the house/museum of Gandhi which was a very important
                    site where there was the image of Gandhi when he striving for the independence
                    of India using non-violence, and it showed him spinning thread with a wooden
                    weaving machine. At that time, the Dalai Lama said, "This is great and is
                    harmonious [Tib. mthun pa] with Buddhism. He had great influence from these two
                    visits. That's why he got the peace prize by carrying the flag of non-violence.
                     We Chinese have a proverb, "it is better to be the head of the bird rather
                    than being a yak tail [Tib. g.yag gi gzhu gu byed pa las/ bya'i mgo byed pa
                    dga']. This means that this person [the Dalai Lama] is ambitious [Tib. ham sems
                    chen po] for power, so he likes to be the head of the bird, although the head of
                    a bird is small. Though the yak tail is big, it is just a tail. The Dalai Lama
                    had a very strong thoughts regarding political power. Do you know about this?   

**Q:** No, I don't.   

**A:** In reality, if he is the king of an independent Tibet, even though Tibet
                    is small, but he is the head. The Dalai Lama very much liked and admired the
                    Sikkim King. The Dalai Lama was not satisfied, even though he was the Vice
                    Chairman of the National People's Congress of the PRC, which is such a big
                    country. The Dalai Lama was thinking that if he becomes the head of the small
                    independent Tibet, he would become the king.  I can prove this from his
                    conduct and his speech. I will tell you a story. In 1955, when he [Dalai Lama]
                    came back from Beijing, he sent Trijang and some people and they did the work
                    for inciting the revolt. When he reached Derge, although I was not there, I
                    heard about this from NgabÃ¶ and Surkhang when they told me about their travels.
                    Surkhang was like a small Tibetan two-sided hand drum [Tib. dra ru]. So he told
                    me about this. When the Dalai Lama reached Derge, he gave the order to the
                    Kashag who were part of his entourage, "I am going to give some dharma teaching
                    for about 10 days in the monastery in Chamdo. In the meantime, you Shapes should
                    discuss an important political matter regarding whether we can become a
                    Federated Republic [Ch. jia meng gung he guo] [Tib. mda' 'brel spyi mthun rgyal
                    khab] in the PRC.  In the past, the Soviet Union had 16 such Republics like
                    the White Russians, etc. The Dalai Lama was very engaged in thinking [Tib.
                    dbyang zhed po cig yod red] about this. In 1955, The Dalai Lama told the Kashag
                    in Chamdo to discuss and collect your opinions on whether we should report to
                    the Central Committee that we should become a Federated Republic.   

**Q:** This might be the PhÃ¼nwang's [Tib. phun dbang] idea.   

**A:** Wow! Do you know about this? Did you know about the Dalai Lama's story
                    that I told you?   

**Q:** No, but the idea about the Soviet Union might be PhÃ¼nwang's thoughts.   

**A:** You are even more knowledgeable than a god! [Tib. lha las mkhas pa]. This
                    was exactly PhÃ¼nwang's thinking. When he went up (to Beijing) PhÃ¼nwang was with
                    him and he told the Dalai Lama about this. So the Dalai Lama was extremely glad
                    (to learn this) and he told the Shapes, but the Shapes got agitated when they
                    discussed this and they wouldn't hold a meeting and saying, "This talk is
                    nonsense and rubbish [Tib. ga yin 'di yin med pa rna bar ma 'gro skad cha].
                    Isn't it good to [keep] do [ing] what we are doing now [have autonomous regions
                    not republics]? [Tib. da lta'i da ga byas na yag po mi 'dug gas]. What the hell
                    is he talking about saying [we should be] a Federated Republic. We don't want
                    this trouble and we are not going to discuss this.  In 1957, at the time of
                    the Lhasa ShotÃ¶n [Tib. zho ston] Opera Festival, when he had many relations with
                    people, the Dalai Lama gave an elaborate party in Norbulinga for the leaders of
                    the military and I was there, but not as an interpreter. They had arranged
                    things like mahjong and cards in the old and the new palaces. At that time, the
                    Dalai Lama said to me, let's go for a walk and he asked me, "Why aren't we
                    allowed to set up a Republic in our country? I told him in detail saying, "If
                    you compare Russia and the PRC they are not comparable [Tib. sdur stangs]
                    regarding the size of their nationalities and how their nationalities were
                    formed [Tib. mi rigs che chung dang chags stang]. For example, before the
                    October Revolution, those like the White Russians, etc. were countries, but we
                    didn't have that. Xinjiang's Sheng Shutse was a warlord [Tib. dmag shed can] not
                    a country. And not only Tibet, but most of the minority nationalities still
                    histories [Tib. gnas bsdad yod red]. So in the bigger regions, Autonomous
                    Regions [Tib. rang skyong ljongs] and in the smaller areas, Autonomous
                    Prefectures [Tib. rang skyong khul] have been set up. And under that, there are
                    Autonomous Counties and also Xiang. This fits with the actual situation[in the
                    PRC] [Tib. dngos yod gnas tshul dang mtsham po] and it is also helpful for the
                    nationalities development. The Dalai Lama probably didn't agree with this, but
                    he just said, "Oh! Oh." So I was astonished [Tib. ha las]. Later, I told TsÃ¶go,
                    ThÃ¶ndrub Tsering [Tib. mtsho sgo don gryb tshe ring] with whom I had a good
                    relationship, "It seems to me the Dalai Lama likes the idea of a Republic. How
                    did that happen?" He said, "You idiot! [Tib. lkugs pa] What is there to be
                    astonished about? This was taught to him by PhÃ¼ntso Wangyal [Tib. phun tshogs
                    dbang rgyal]. But you should not talk about this recklessly. [Tib. gang byung
                    mang byung] Do you have anything to prove it?" I said, "of course I have
                    the proof because he said it in Derge." Then he told me, "If you don't believe
                    me, go ahead and ask Sawang NgabÃ¶. So later I asked NgabÃ¶ whether it is like
                    that, and he said, "Of course it is like that." When Chamdo was liberated, he
                    was the Doji (Governor-General)and PhÃ¼nwang was there. So NgabÃ¶ told me, "Since
                    1950, there was the danger that I would have been deceived [Tib. mgo skor] by
                    this. When NgabÃ¶ said that, since he was the first Tibetan Communist Party
                    member and a scholar on theory [Tib. rigs pa'i gzhung lugs la mkhas pa], I
                    believed him. So the Dalai Lama was engrossed [Tib. dbyings yod] with this idea
                    [of a Republic like the USSR.]   

**Q:** In 1955, who told you about how the Dalai Lama gave the order to the
                    Shapes to discuss that?   

**A:**  NgabÃ¶ told me.   

**Q:** I talked with NgabÃ¶ many years ago and he told me, "Actually, there was
                    no need to launch the revolt. In 1958, if the Tibetan Government had taken
                    methods and talked with the Khambas or had sent the army and expeled the
                    Khambas, there was no reason for the revolt to take place. But the Tibetan
                    Government didn't do that. NgabÃ¶ was blaming the Tibetan Government and the
                    Dalai Lama. What do you think about this? I think he was right.   

**A:**  This was right. In the beginning, after the revolt had failed in Gansu,
                    TshongÃ¶n [Tib. mtsho sngon] (Qinghai) and Kham, those people escaped and came up
                    to Tibet. So if the Kashag could taken action to arrest them or had given them
                    instructions to go back [to Sichuan], but they couldn't do that. I am not sure
                    about what the Dalai Lama was thinking at that time, but at that time, there was
                    the Kashag and some Dalai Lama's attendants who were talking with him everyday.
                    There was a group of people who were holding very strong thoughts about not
                    reforming the joint political and religious system of the Feudal Serfdom (of
                    Tibet).   

**Q:** Probably Phala, [Tib. pha lha] was one of them?   

**A:** No. Not Phala. There was Lukhangwa [Tib. klu khang ba], Lobsang Tashi,
                    [Tib. blo bzang bkra shis] Talama Jogtang and those people.   

**Q:** How about Trijang Rinpoche?   

**A:** Of course, he was one. Some people had very strong thoughts of Tibetan
                    independence. These people were Phala, Surkhang Wangchen Gelek, Liushar Thubten
                    Tharpa [Tib. sne'u thub bstan thar pa] and Trijang who played a dual role [Tib.
                    nyis rtseg]. These two groups had the basis to become united [Tib. gcog chags]
                    because independence is the method to not have the old system be reformed. If
                    they remained under PRC, sooner and later the democratic reform will be
                    implemented. The groups who wanted to become independent were the puppets of the
                    foreign countries and they had relations with them.  [Lowell] Thomas was an
                    American and the British touched hands [Tib. lag pa 'chang] in the 18th century
                    [???] and from that time the Americans touched Tibet. In 1958, the Dalai
                    Lama met the two people airdropped by the CIA who were carrying wireless
                    equipment.   

**Q:** I met one person called Lithang Athar [Tib. lit hang a dar].   

**A:** This had a great influence on the Dalai Lama. Later, maybe Gyalo Thondub
                    woke up from his dream. Anyway, much later he wanted to meet me though he didn't
                    call me. One day, he came to me and said, "I worked for the CIA and I also
                    worked for the Indian General Office [Tib. spyi khyab las khungs]. Now I have
                    come to know that both the Americans and the Indians were saying that we will do
                    this and that for the Tibetans, but actually, they were thinking about their own
                    benefit [Tib. khe phan] and were not thinking about Tibet's benefit. So now I
                    have woken up from my dream."   

**Q:** In my book, "the demise of the lamaist state" I also named the Americans
                    and the Indians as bad friends because I have the hand written dairy of Shakabpa
                    in which it was written that the Jenkhentsisum had a very close relation with
                    the Indian Government and the Indian Government was paying them ae monthly
                    salary. And there was lot of trouble in Kalimpong.   

**A:** The British Ambassador Patterson was also saying that [Ed. Patterson was
                    actually a British missionary].   

**Q:** But the Khambas were causing trouble and the Tibetan Government was not
                    doing anything and NgabÃ¶ could not push the government to make war [against the
                    Khamba] right? At that time, some people in Lhasa were saying if the government
                    sent troops, they will join the Khambas, but I asked some military officers
                    about this and they said that if they were sent to make war with the Khambas,
                    they will make the war because usually, they didn't like the Khambas. So I think
                    the government could have taken action.   

**A:** This is a fact.   

**Q:** What was your government doing at that time?   

**A:** At that time, we were saying that the revolt is just a matter of the
                    local security and not a matter of the national defense [Tib. rgyal srung]. So
                    there is a big difference between these. You, the Local Tibetan Government have
                    your soldiers and police and it is your duty to protect the security of the
                    local places. As for the PLA, it has the duty to safeguard the national borders.
                    If there are some offenses [Tib. gnod yas] against the border, we will send the
                    PLA right away. But if we send the defensive [PLA] troops for the local
                    security, this will be against the rules [Tib. lugs dang ma thun pa].  I
                    will tell you another story. There was a person called Jiang Huating who was a
                    company leader in the Independent Artillery Company.   

**Q:** I met him in India. His Tibetan name is Lobsang Tashi.   

**A:** Jiang Huating deceived and engaged in misconduct by having [sexual]
                    relations with a [Tibetan] girl of the household guarding a park in Lhasa. Later
                    [after he escaped the PLA camp], he was kept in the Trapchi Regiment whose DepÃ¶n
                    was Tashi Bera [Tib. bkra shis dpal rab]. He was kept there for about 7 days,
                    and we knew about this. One day, Political Commissar Tan [Guansan] called
                    me and told me to call all the members of the Kashag for a meeting in the office
                    Jiaoji qu. So I made phone calls to Surkhang, Shasur [Tib. bsgad zur], NgabÃ¶,
                    Liushar, Talama and Lobsang Samten. I told them, "Our PLA soldier Jiang Huating
                    had rebelled against us and you have kept him in the Tibetan soldier's
                    regiment." At that time, Surkhang was the senior Shape [Tib. khri pa]. So I told
                    Surkhang to hand over that person. We have the proof, so don't say that you
                    don't know about that. Then Surkhang said, "Yes, yes, we will do as you say."
                    Then I asked Surkhang, "How are going to do that?" Surkhang said, "I will
                    enquire about this and if he is really there, I myself will tie him up with a
                    rope and bring him to the presence of the Political Commissar. The Political
                    Commissar said, "That sound good and your attitude is good" and then the meeting
                    was over.  After 2-3 days, Surkhang came all of a sudden. At that time, we
                    had given Hapo brand [???] British cars to each Shape and Surkhang came in his
                    car just near my hostel door at around midday. He was acting and told me,
                    "Please help me today. Otherwise, I will die. Please help me to meet the
                    Political Commissar Tan." I thought this was about the matter of Jiang Huating
                    so I called the Political Commissar and told him that Surkhang wants to see you.
                    He said, "Bring him here."   

**Q:** Surkhang didn't tell you the reason for wanting to meet the Political
                    Commissar?   

**A:** He didn't. When we entered the Political Commissar's office he was
                    sitting near the table and Surkhang kneeled down at once without saying anything
                    and he offered a khata of the best quality called NangdzÃ¶. I was surprised and
                    the Political Commissar was also kind of surprised and yelled, "Surkhang! What
                    happened to you? Surkhang was indicating [Tan] should to receive the khata so I
                    told the Political Commissar to take the khata. Then Surkhang slapped himself
                    7-8 times till he was in tears and said, "I am not a man! I am a ghost! I am so
                    sorry! Then the Political Commissar told him not to do that and tell him what
                    happened. Then Surkhang said, "Last time, I told you that I will enquire about
                    Jiang Huating and if I found him, I will tie him up and bring him to you, but I
                    am sorry to tell you now that I couldn't accomplish my duty. When I went to
                    enquire about him, he had fled the night before. So it has become as if I didn't
                    keep my words and I deceived the Political Commissar. So I feel ashamed and I
                    feel pain in my mind.' Then he cried. He was acting like this. You didn't know
                    this, right?   

**Q:** Yes. I didn't.   

**A:** Once before that, he told me when he was enjoying a picnic, "Do you know
                    what we kudrak think about the politics? I said, "How can I know what the kudrak
                    are thinking about politics? Then he told me, "Whoever is good in acting
                    two-faced, we regard him as a politician, [Tib. chab srid mkhas pa]. Surkhang
                    was that kind of person.   

**Q:** The old society was like that. Thank you so much for your time, it is
                    very useful.
