**A:**  They have set up a school and they would teach some hand writing.   

**Q:**  When you first became a monk, what did your <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. དགེ་རྒན] 1. Teacher in a school. 2. In monastic settings it also refers to an adult monk who acted as a guardian to a younger monk. In such cases, the younger monk typically lived in the gegen&#x27;s apartment (shag). In monasteries, however, it could also mean a real teacher, or the monk who served as the guarantor for a new monk.">gegen</span> do for you since he didn't give food and you didn't live with him? Was he just namely a gegen?   

**A:**  He was my guarantor <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. དགེ་རྒན] 1. Teacher in a school. 2. In monastic settings it also refers to an adult monk who acted as a guardian to a younger monk. In such cases, the younger monk typically lived in the gegen&#x27;s apartment (shag). In monasteries, however, it could also mean a real teacher, or the monk who served as the guarantor for a new monk.">gegen</span>, khekhyag [Tib. ཁས་འཁྱག] gegen which was the main gegen. If the monks did bad things in the monastery, the <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. གྲྭ་ཚང] A &quot;college&quot; within a monastery, for example, in Drepung Monastery there were four main tratsang: Gomang, Loseling, Deyang and Ngagpa. These tratsang were property owning corporate entities and included monks who were organized into residential dormitories called Khamtsen.">tratsang</span> would call his khekhyag gegen and say, "Your <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. དགེ་ཕྲུག] 1. Student. 2. Disciple. 3. Commonly the name for monks living with a gegen or teacher. These are more like wards than real disciples.">gidru</span> is doing these bad things. When you became the khekhyag gegen, you and your gidru have put your seals" When they settle the matter, the gegen would be fined though they wouldn't beat him with switches and imprison him.   

**Q:**  How would you do if you need a <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. དཔེ་ཆའི་དགེ་རྒན] A monk who teaches reading religious texts.">pechai gegen</span>? Would the khekhyag <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. དགེ་རྒན] 1. Teacher in a school. 2. In monastic settings it also refers to an adult monk who acted as a guardian to a younger monk. In such cases, the younger monk typically lived in the gegen&#x27;s apartment (shag). In monasteries, however, it could also mean a real teacher, or the monk who served as the guarantor for a new monk.">gegen</span> help you?   

**A:**  We have to look for our own <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. དཔེ་ཆའི་དགེ་རྒན] A monk who teaches reading religious texts.">pechai gegen</span> carefully. The pechai gegen should be an older monk who is good in <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. དཔེ་ཆ] Religious books/texts, scriptures.">pecha</span> and new monks were not allowed to be the pechai gegen. But when a <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. གྲྭ་རྒྱུན] Monks who came to Drepung, Ganden and Sera from far distances such as Kham and Amdo.">tragyün</span> first comes, his livelihood would be hard and doesn't know anyone, so for 1 or 2 years he wouldn't start studying pecha. After 2 years you become familiar to the area and have friends and if there were some asking him "aren't you going to study pecha? If you say yes, they would look for a pechai gegen. At this time, there were many pechai gegen. There were great <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. དགེ་ཤེས] An advanced degree earned by scholar monks.">geshe</span> still alive who can teach you <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. བསྡུས་གྲྭ] The first curriculum in Buddhist dialectics in Gelugpa monasteries. It is an abbreviated course in logic (tib. ཙེམ [ཚད་མ]). There are 6 classes and monks ideally study one class each year. The first class is khatog garmar [tib. ཁ་དོག་དཀར་དམར], followed by düdring [tib. བསྡུས་འབྲིང], then düchen [tib. བསྡུས་ཆེན], then tagrik [tib. རྟགས་རིག], and then finally lurik [tib. བླུ་རིག].">düdra</span>, Namdren [Tib. རྣམ་འདྲེན], dzö [Tib. མཛོད], uma [Tib. དབུ་མ] etc. You would find a appropiate pechai gegen according to your standard and if you say "I would like to study pecha with you", he would say okay. Then you start studying pecha and also work for your livelihood. For a few years the tragyün would not study pecha since they only have few monks they know in the monastery and in the society. After that, when they become familiar to the place, they take off a day and go to work for the day. Sometimes, the bigger <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. ཤག་ཚང] 1. The household or family of a monk that consisted of multiple monks. 2. The apartment of a monk household.">shagtsang</span> would hire you for carrying something into Lhasa for them, or bring something back from Lhasa for them. They wouldn't pay any special wages, but they would give you a lot of food. If you do that well then they would call you for other jobs. So in this way you can study and work for three years and then because of the blessing from the pecha you would get engrossed and have a real interest in pecha and you would become more enthusiastic. And would continually study pecha and you would be okay. But if you compare the monks who study pecha and the ones who don't study pecha, the pechawa have more difficulty because they don't go anywhere except going to the <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. ཚོགས] 1. A prayer assembly meeting in monasteries when all the monks come to an assembly hall and chant prayers together. 2. An offering made of tsamba, butter and dry cheese in the shape of a cone.">tsog</span> and <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. ཆོས་ར] The special grove (&quot;dharma grove&quot;) in monasteries where monks formally met to practice debating.">chöra</span> [Tib. ཆོས་ར]. These pechawa would not go for harvesting, tönyog [Tib. སྟོན་གཡོག], construction and delivering messages etc.   

**Q:**  At this time, were you in your <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. 1. ཤག, 2. ཞག] 1. The apartment/room of a monk. 2. The butter fat that coagulates on the top of butter-tea when the tea is left to sit for some time. If the tea had been made with a lot of butter, this layer could be thick enough to scoop off and save to later sell or eat separately. The senior monks are usually served tea with a lot of shag.">shag</span> alone?   

**A:**  When I first became the monk for about 4 years I lived alone. Then my younger brother from the same parents came from Kham and we lived together.   

**Q:**  Did your brother come from Kham as a <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. གྲྭ་རྒྱུན] Monks who came to Drepung, Ganden and Sera from far distances such as Kham and Amdo.">tragyün</span>?   

**A:**  Yes. Later, he worked as a half servant and half member of the household, ngomayog [Tib. ངོ་མ་གཡོག] in a <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. སྐུ་དྲག] 1. A member of the lay aristocracy. 2. Title for government lay and monk officials. 3. A name occasionally used for the top leaders/officials in a monastery.">kudrak</span> household. They paid him food and a little bit wages and some clothes and he would bring me the wages. In the beginning, when I became a monk, for about 7 years, I didn't know many people and I had to go to work on contructions and doing other hard works like harvesting. If I did some light works, I didn't get much income during this period. Then I knew some people in the monastery and in Lhasa and started going to perform rituals and to read scriptures [Tib. ཆོས་ཀློག]. Then my income became okay [Tib. འགྲིགས་ཙམ]. First, I came by carrying a backpack and I didn't expect to get a lot of things from the monastery, but by the grace of the Three Jewels [Tib. མཆོག་གསུམ] and the monastery I became okay though most of the monks didn't have a fixed income on which they could depend on for certain months. About the half of the monks who came from near by were okay on their livelihood because their family and relatives were near by, but one third of the <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. བོད་པ] 1. A person from Central Tibet (tib. དབུས) or sometimes someone from political Tibet in contrast to persons from Kham and Amdo. 2. Böpa is also used nowadays as a general name for all ethnic Tibetans.">böba</span> who didn't get such help were even poorer than the monks coming from the long distance and they were called böba khampa.   

**Q:**  Why were they so poor?   

**A:**  Who knows! Maybe because of their karmic result, their households were poor and they weren't capable themselves, so they had to live poor in the monastery.   

**Q:**  Did your household help you?   

**A:**  No. My household got heavily in debt after I went to Drepung and it was kind of dispersed .I held no hatred [Tib. ཁོན་སེམས] and I also didn't have any attachments towards my homeland and I didn't think about what is going on in my homeland. As far as I am concerned, my homeland is here and my relative is also here. It is like the saying "wherever it is happy, that is my homeland, whoever is kind to me, they are my parents" [Tib.གང་སྐྱིད་ཕ་ཡུལ། སུ་བྱམས་ཕ་མ]. So I thought that this is right and I was attached to this place. After 1959 revolt, at the end of the Culture Revolution, the monastery made announcement of the policy that the <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. གྲལ་རིམ; ch. 阶级] 1. A social class. 2. A class enemy.">trerim</span> are not allowed to go to the city to live but they could return to the countrysides. But I had no thought of going back home. I thought whatever happens, the monastery would be better for me. Now things are bad, but later it will improve because regardless of the religion and the politics, everything will change. In 1961-62, we had some hardship when we got 19 <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. རྒྱ་མ] A unit of weight equal to one jin [ch. 斤] (1.1 lbs).">gyama</span> <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. རྩམ་པ] The traditional Tibetan staple food that consists of grain that is roasted (popped), usually in sand, and then ground into a flour.">tsampa</span> for a month and had to share a pack of matches with another monk. So we sold the things in our <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. 1. ཤག, 2. ཞག] 1. The apartment/room of a monk. 2. The butter fat that coagulates on the top of butter-tea when the tea is left to sit for some time. If the tea had been made with a lot of butter, this layer could be thick enough to scoop off and save to later sell or eat separately. The senior monks are usually served tea with a lot of shag.">shag</span> with low price for tsamba. [not in the tape] Trindorla remembers standing in line for long time when the tsampa grinders announced they were selling tsampa tomorrow]   

**Q:**  Did you ever go back to your homeland?   

**Q:**  I never went back to Kham and I was always staying in Drepung Monastery and I was also not capable of doing religious practice. I also didn't serve on politics for the monastery. And after they fired cannons, it was over.   

**Q:**  You said there might be 400-500 monks going for tönyog, is this the figure just in Phembo?   

**A:**  No, it was the figure for all over like Phembo, <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. འབྲི་གུང] The Drigung Monastery.">Drigung</span> [Tib. འབྲི་གུང] Metro [Tib. མལ་གྲོ] <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. ཆུ་ཤུར] The name of a town, district and county at the confluence of the Lhasa and Tsangpo Rivers.">Chushü</span> [Tib. ཆུ་ཤུར] Tölung [Tib. སྟོད་ལུང] Lhoka, the areas around the airport. Some people we know would tell us go to those place for the tönyog.   

**Q:**  After you came to Drepung, in those first few years, how much <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. རྩམ་པ] The traditional Tibetan staple food that consists of grain that is roasted (popped), usually in sand, and then ground into a flour.">tsampa</span>, tea and those stuffs do you need to consume in a month?   

**A:**  Sometimes, if I work as a servant, I get food to be full and I get food to be full and also get wages if I work on constructions when they build new houses for the monastery, I could save some <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. རྩམ་པ] The traditional Tibetan staple food that consists of grain that is roasted (popped), usually in heated sand, and then ground into a flour.">tsamba</span> from the monthly <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. རྩམ་པ] The traditional Tibetan staple food that consists of grain that is roasted (popped), usually in sand, and then ground into a flour.">tsampa</span> salary. When I couldn't get a job, I wouldn't think of having butter tea, but I couldn't survive without tsampa. Usually I eat bag and drink black tea. Actually, I eat about 1 <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. ཁལ] A traditional volume measurement used for measuring grain in traditional Tibetan society. Sizes of this unit varied somewhat, but the official government khe (called mkhar ru or bstan dzin mkha ru) weighed about 28-31 pounds for barley. It was used to convey the size of fields. For example, a field said to be 10 khe in size meant that 10 khe of seed could be sown on that field.">khe</span> and half of tsampa in a month if it was available. If not I would have to manage with 1 khe of tsampa or even less than 1 khe.   

**Q:**  Do you eat one and half <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. ཁལ] A traditional volume measurement used for measuring grain in traditional Tibetan society. Sizes of this unit varied somewhat, but the official government khe (called mkhar ru or bstan dzin mkha ru) weighed about 28-31 pounds for barley. It was used to convey the size of fields. For example, a field said to be 10 khe in size meant that 10 khe of seed could be sown on that field.">khe</span> when you were working?   

**A:**  If you have something to eat, it doesn't make much difference between working or not working.   

**Q:**  Trindor: If you eat one and half <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. ཁལ] A traditional volume measurement used for measuring grain in traditional Tibetan society. Sizes of this unit varied somewhat, but the official government khe (called mkhar ru or bstan dzin mkha ru) weighed about 28-31 pounds for barley. It was used to convey the size of fields. For example, a field said to be 10 khe in size meant that 10 khe of seed could be sown on that field.">khe</span>, it is equal to 42 <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. རྒྱ་མ] A unit of weight equal to one jin [ch. 斤] (1.1 lbs).">gyama</span>, right?   

**A:**  Yes. If our <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. རྩམ་པ] The traditional Tibetan staple food that consists of grain that is roasted (popped), usually in heated sand, and then ground into a flour.">tsamba</span> ran out and we have some money, we would buy some bread [Tib. bag lep]. [probably 2 bread weigh 1 gyama].   

**Q:**  What kind of tea do you buy? Do you buy tea bricks?   

**A:**  We buy loose tea either in the monastery or from Lhasa. The tea seller would smash the brick tea and pile it on some kind of sheets and I would buy tea measuring in bowls. There were two size of bowls. At that time, the bigger one was 1 <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. ཏམ་ཀ] A unit in the traditional Tibetan currency system that was equal to 4 sang.">tranka</span> and later it was 3 sho. Just before the revolt, it might be about 5 sho. If you buy tea in Lhasa it was little cheaper. In the monastery there was only one size bowl which cost 1 sho. We buy butter cut in slices. There was also radish and vegetable in the morning market at the monastery everyday. We also could buy boiled hoof of yak [Tib. སུག་མཐིལ] for 1 <span class="tooltip" data-text="[ch. 分] 1/100th of a yuan; one cent.">fen</span> or half fen. We didn't cook meals in our shag. We also by boiled coagulated blood [Tib. ཁྲག་ཤ] which is a real poor person's food. [In the old society, the butchers feed dogs with this].   

**Q:**  In a month, how many times did you eat meat?   

**A:**  Not at all when we just arrived. If there is a particularly good gye/phog I might buy a <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. ཏམ་ཀ] A unit in the traditional Tibetan currency system that was equal to 4 sang.">tranka</span> worth of meat and some radish and cook these together, but this was very seldom. Usually, I had to save money to buy <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. རྩམ་པ] The traditional Tibetan staple food that consists of grain that is roasted (popped), usually in heated sand, and then ground into a flour.">tsamba</span> and clothes.   

**Q:**  Where did your firewood come from?   

**A:**  I had to buy it.   

**Q:**  Was it cow dung or sheep droppings?   

**A:**  We use cow dung in the stove and use sheep droppings in the clay fire pot [Tib. མེ་ཁོག] to keep the tea warm. For about 1-2 years we wouldn't buy cow dungs. Mostly I go to the mountain to collect cow dung and cut a kind of grass called khenpa [Tib. འཁན་པ] then we dry them in winter and use it as fuel. At that time, there was thurmos in Lhasa, but we couldn't afford to buy it.   

**Q:**  When you were first in monastery, after you got up, did you have to make fire?   

**A:**  Yes. Usually I sleep for awhile and don't go to <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. མང་ཇ] The morning tea served to monks from all the monastic colleges at the main prayer assembly hall.">mangja</span>, so when I get up I make some tea and eat some bag. Then I would read the <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. སྒོ་མང] One of the large colleges in Drepung Monastery.">Gomang</span>'s prayer called chöjö [Tib. ཆོས་སྤྱོད] which had over 100 pages. Sometimes when I didn't want to read, I just stayed idle and no one was pushing me and I myself was not kind of diligent in my study.   

**Q:**  Did you go to the morning dharma session <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. ཞོགས་ཆོས] The morning chöra (debating) session.">shogchö</span>, [Tib. ཞོགས་ཆོས]?   

**A:**  No. But sometimes I went to the afternoon dharma session, gungtsig [Tib. དགུང་ཚིགས] and sometimes I also for the ritual session, gurim [Tib. སྐུ་རིམ] and sometimes not.   

**Q:**  Did you go to the big <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. ཤག་ཚང] 1. The household or family of a monk that consisted of multiple monks. 2. The apartment of a monk household.">shagtsang</span> and <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. བླ་བྲང] 1. The property/wealth owning corporate entity of an incarnate lama. 2. The property/wealth owning corporate entity of the Panchen Lama.">labrang</span> asking for work?   

**A:**  No, we didn't have to do this. They would come to ask you to work or take a messages etc. If you were sent to Lhasa to take something you get food before you left and after you arrived in Lhasa. There was no wages. So as I got to know more people, even though I had nothing or little in my <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. 1. ཤག, 2. ཞག] 1. The apartment/room of a monk. 2. The butter fat that coagulates on the top of butter-tea when the tea is left to sit for some time. If the tea had been made with a lot of butter, this layer could be thick enough to scoop off and save to later sell or eat separately. The senior monks are usually served tea with a lot of shag.">shag</span>, because I got sent on a lot of work, I still had food to eat.   

**Q:**  Please tell us about the <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. ལྡབ་ལྡོབ] A mildly deviant type of fighting or &quot;punk&quot; monk who engaged in fighting and other unusual behaviors for monks in traditional Tibet&#x27;s large monasteries.">dobdo</span> from the long distance? What was the difference between the <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. བོད་པ] 1. A person from Central Tibet (tib. དབུས) or sometimes someone from political Tibet in contrast to persons from Kham and Amdo. 2. Böpa is also used nowadays as a general name for all ethnic Tibetans.">böba</span> dobdo and the dobdo from the long distance? Did you have a kind of <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. སྐྱིད་སྡུག] An association, club.">kyidu</span>?   

**A:**  No. We didn't have the eatig commune, <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. ལྟོ་ཚང] 1. The club of the Dobdos. 2. A group of people eating together.">tobtsang</span> [Tib. ལྟོ་ཚང] although we were dressed like <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. ལྡབ་ལྡོབ] A mildly deviant type of fighting or &quot;punk&quot; monk who engaged in fighting and other unusual behaviors for monks in traditional Tibet&#x27;s large monasteries.">dobdo</span>. I was a dobdo with not good clothes but not ragged clothes. I was mentally happy and also didn't fight and haven't killed anyone. But others would fight and kill each other by stabbing and hit the sword on their heads.   

**Q:**  I heard that the <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. ཨ་མདོ] One of the three main Tibetan sub-ethnic areas. It is located in the northeast of the Tibetan Plateau mostly in today&#x27;s Qinghai Province.

A person from Central Tibet (tib. དབུས) or sometimes someone from political Tibet in contrast to persons from Kham and Amdo. 2. Böpa is also used nowadays as a general name for all ethnic Tibetans.">böba</span> would fight when they serve thukpa.   

**A:**  Yes. they do.   

**Q:**  Were you with the <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. བོད་པ] 1. A person from Central Tibet (tib. དབུས) or sometimes someone from political Tibet in contrast to persons from Kham and Amdo. 2.

It is located in the northeast of the Tibetan Plateau mostly in today&#x27;s Qinghai Province. A person from Amdo is called an Amdowa.">Amdo</span> ?   

**A:**  There was a very bad fight soon after I joined the monastery and in general when they pass by the road a fight erupted without much reason and mostly just pushing when they meet on the way. Mostly the <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. ལྡབ་ལྡོབ] A mildly deviant type of fighting or &quot;punk&quot; monk who engaged in fighting and other unusual behaviors for monks in traditional Tibet&#x27;s large monasteries.">dobdo</span> fighting was over small things such as saying "why are you looking at me in an angry manner? [Tib. མིག་ལོག་ལྟ] Why did you push me? It was because the political stucture was not widely announced in the society. In general, in Kham area, there were many killings over things like the ownership of <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. གཞིས་ཀ] A manorial estate.">shiga</span>, regarding the loans and spouse fights and in Lhasa there were less, but there were event where even monks, lamas, traders and <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. སྐུ་དྲག] 1. A member of the lay aristocracy. 2. Title for government lay and monk officials. 3. A name occasionally used for the top leaders/officials in a monastery.">kudrak</span> were killed. Also sometimes there were fights in market. One monk would be asking how much something is and the dobdo standing by would say, "That's mine I have bought it." And the 1st would say, "If you have bought it give the money now." The <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. ཨ་མདོ] One of the three main Tibetan sub-ethnic areas. It is located in the northeast of the Tibetan Plateau mostly in today&#x27;s Qinghai Province. A person from Amdo is called an Amdowa.">Amdo</span> dobdo would wear good clothes. During summer, the Amdo and the <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. ཁམས་པ] A person from the Kham region, a Tibetan from the Khampa (Khamba) sub-cultural group.">Khampa</span> would go to trade though it was not a big trade and come back in winter.   

**Q:**  In general, were the <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. ཨ་མདོ] One of the three main Tibetan sub-ethnic areas. It is located in the northeast of the Tibetan Plateau mostly in today&#x27;s Qinghai Province. A person from Amdo is called an Amdowa.">Amdo</span> richer than the Khambas or were they same?   

**A:**  <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. ཨ་མདོ] One of the three main Tibetan sub-ethnic areas. It is located in the northeast of the Tibetan Plateau mostly in today&#x27;s Qinghai Province. A person from Amdo is called an Amdowa.">Amdo</span> were slightly richer. The reason for this is that the Amdo keep good relations with their homeland. And their families send them a lot of help. And they do trading in summer. But as for the <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. ཁམས་པ] A person from the Kham region, a Tibetan from the Khamba (Khampa) sub-cultural group.">Khamba</span>, although there are many traders in the town and some families send some help, but they send less than the Amdo. The monks from the long distance do more trade and are more capable in trade, although it is nothing if you compare with the trade in present time. For example, we sold incense, adhesive tape used on face, matches, tobacco, snuff, soap, cotton tassels used on the hair braid in the countryside. In Lhasa, the <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. སྐུ་དྲག] 1. A member of the lay aristocracy. 2. Title for government lay and monk officials. 3. A name occasionally used for the top leaders/officials in a monastery.">kudrak</span> and the rich people were using the silk tassels. In return, the monks take money, <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. རྩམ་པ] The traditional Tibetan staple food that consists of grain that is roasted (popped), usually in heated sand, and then ground into a flour.">tsamba</span> and flour.   

**Q:**  Did you go to rush and the compete in serving <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. ཐུག་པ] 1. A porridge or gruel-like soup typically made with tsamba, and if available, meat and cheese. 2.

The senior monks are usually served tea with a lot of shag.">shag</span> and wear medium clothes. The reason for this is that the melted butter drips all over when you serve. We also change our vest, töngag [Tib. སྟོད་འགག] and wear a thin long shawl. After the first tea in the traja, the sponsor would walk around the <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. ཚོག] 1.

There is a gong near the door from where the tea and thukpa is served.   

**Q:**  Who would beat the gong?   

**A:**  The <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. ཇ་གཡོག] Assistant to the Jama (The monk who is in charge of a monastery&#x27;s kitchen).">jayog</span> would beat the gong. Only <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. སྒོ་མང] One of the large colleges in Drepung Monastery.">Gomang</span> has the gong beating custom for telling the chagde to get up to serve. When the gong is beaten, the above mentioned six monastic officials move aside and the thugyag monks would run out. When the 2nd tea is almost being served, and the tea servers, chagde [Tib. ཕྱག་བདེ] go back and the <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. ཐུག་པ] 1. A porridge or gruel-like soup typically made with tsamba, and if available, meat and cheese. 2. Noodle dishes in broth.">thukpa</span> servers get up and start rushing.

**A:**  Yes. Serving <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. ཐུག་པ] 1. A porridge or gruel-like soup typically made with tsamba, and if available, meat and cheese. 2. Noodle dishes in broth.">thukpa</span> to try for the first serving [Tib. ཐུག་རྒྱག་དང་པོ] is dangerous, as others would try to push you and some malicious ones would even hit on your head and eyes where you get wounded and there would be controversy after the tsog. So I didn't rush much to get the first place. If you get first in serving thukpa people would talk about you, but there is no other profit except reputation.   

**Q:**  There is no reward, right?   

**A:**  Yes, nothing. The thousands of monks would be sitting there saying "who is the first, who is the first?" and they would look very carefully. Then when the <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. དགེ་སྐོས] The main disciplinary official in a monastic college (tratsang).">gegö</span> says beat the gong, if the <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. ཆབ་རིལ] The Chabril&#x27;s main work was overseeing serving the traja.

The böba were very tough [Tib. ངན་པ] at this time. Among the böba, there was one nicknamed "yak calf" Yagtrug [Tib. གཡག་ཕྲུག] who was more brave and stronger than the Amdo and he got the first place many times from among 10-20 Amdo trying to block him to get the first. If he gets into a fight he is tough -he wears a knife and a fighting key. He was tougher than the Amdo. Usually, the Amdo gets the first place.   

**Q:**  Did they grab the <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. ཐུག་པ] 1. A porridge or gruel-like soup typically made with tsamba, and if available, meat and cheese. 2. Noodle dishes in broth.">thukpa</span> in the <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. རུང་ཁང] A monastic kitchen.">rungkhang</span>? Where do they keep the thukpa containers, sola [Tib. ཟོ་ལག]?   

**A:**  The sola were kept at one side of the <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. རུང་ཁང] A monastic kitchen.">rungkhang</span> and the tea container, chabtra [Tib. ཇ་ཁྲ] were kept on the other side of the rungkhang and ladle would be given after they got the <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. ཐུག་པ] 1. A porridge or gruel-like soup typically made with tsamba, and if available, meat and cheese. 2. Noodle dishes in broth.">thukpa</span>.

Once before the <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. ཐབ་གཡོག] Monks or laymen who work as servants/manual laborers in kitchens (normally monastic kitchens).">thabyog</span> put the thukpa in the sola, the <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. ལྡབ་ལྡོབ] A mildly deviant type of fighting or &quot;punk&quot; monk who engaged in fighting and other unusual behaviors for monks in traditional Tibet&#x27;s large monasteries.">dobdo</span> climbed up on the stove and the put the first scoop of thukpa into his sola with his hands.   

**Q:**  Didn't his hands get burnt?   

**A:**  Since there is a lot of butter fat on the top, it doesn't burn hands. The stove is high and you have to climb up to it to get <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. ཐུག་པ] 1. A porridge or gruel-like soup typically made with tsamba, and if available, meat and cheese. 2. Noodle dishes in broth.">thukpa</span>. Yagtrug was able to jump from the stove over the monks waiting to get thukpa and land on the threshold of the <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. རུང་ཁང] A monastic kitchen.">rungkhang</span> ready to run out.   

**A:**  In the runkhang, there are the <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. ཐབ་གཡོག] Monks or laymen who work as servants/manual laborers in kitchens (normally monastic kitchens).">thabyog</span> and 2 monks over seeing the <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. ཐུག་པ] 1.

These tratsang were property owning corporate entities and included monks who were organized into residential dormitories called Khamtsen.">tratsang</span> and they would hold sticks. If they go to scoop out the thukpa with their sola, they would beat the thukpa servers with the stick. But some tricky [Tib. མགོ་བདེ་པོ] ones only scoop up one or two handful into their sola and then leave and the jigyab would not get the time to beat him. For the first and second place they would only put thukpa enough for 1-2 monks. There was an instance when Yagtrug grabbed a handful of thukpa and simply smeared it on the top edge so that it looked like full but the sola was really empty. They only let 4-5 go into the front row. The 2nd and 3rd don't matter so much, it's the first that people talk about and that builds a reputation. So later, the <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. དགེ་སྐོས] The main disciplinary official in a monastic college (tratsang).">gegö</span> has to run over to the front row when the gong has been beaten so as to reach there before the <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. ལྡབ་ལྡོབ] A mildly deviant type of fighting or &quot;punk&quot; monk who engaged in fighting and other unusual behaviors for monks in traditional Tibet&#x27;s large monasteries.">dobdo</span> and he stays facing the monks to check if they actually have any thukpa inside their sola and when he found the sola is empty, he beat them very severely.   

**Q:**  Where would the first and the second place serve the <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. ཐུག་པ] 1. A porridge or gruel-like soup typically made with tsamba, and if available, meat and cheese. 2. Noodle dishes in broth.">thukpa</span>?   

**A:**  In the front row, they would send only 5-6 <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. ཐུག་པ] 1. A porridge or gruel-like soup typically made with tsamba, and if available, meat and cheese. 2. Noodle dishes in broth.">thukpa</span> servers.

**A:**  Then 2 monks are sent into each row. These two are called the [Tib.གྲལ་ཐུག] The rest are held up in two rows (by the wall). Then someone would check if there are any empty sola left and if there are then the <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. དགེ་སྐོས] The main disciplinary official in a monastic college (tratsang).">gegö</span> and <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. ཆབ་རིལ] The Chabril&#x27;s main work was overseeing serving the traja.

A porridge or gruel-like soup typically made with tsamba, and if available, meat and cheese. 2. Noodle dishes in broth.">thukpa</span> to the end of the rows Then the chabril would give a speech in the tsog which is called tsogtam [Tib. ཚོགས་གཏམ] very loudly saying, "the rich sponsor is making this offering with great pleasure, respect and faith like using the wealth from the storage of Namse, the Deity of Wealth. If some evil persons waste and spoil this offering, I will not let him get through easily. So you should serve it with respect and faith and in a happy manner" [Tib. སྦྱིན་བདག་འབྱོར་པ་ཅན་གྱིས་ལག་མ་ཐོགས་པར། དད་གུས་སྤྲོ་གསུམ་གྱི་ངང་ནས། ལྷ་རྣམ་སྲས་ཀྱི་བང་མཛོད་ལ་ལོངས་སུ་སྤྱོད་པ་ལྟར་གྱི་མཆོད་འབུལ་ཞུས་ཡོད་པ། མི་ངན་འགའ་ཤས་ཀྱིས་འཕྲོ་བརླག་ཆུད་ཟོས་བཏང་ན། ལས་སླ་པོར་བཞག་གི་མིན། ཁྱོད་ཚོས་དད་ཅིང་སྤྲོ་བའི་ངང་ནས་ཡག་པོ་ཞུ་དགོས] He would say it so loudly that he gets choacked like he is almost going to die. [laughter] Usually, they start serving from the west. The chabri would lead them to the western-most or eastern-most row. It was said [the sidhi called] Drugpa Künleg [Tib. འབྲུག་པ་ཀུན་ལེགས] served from the west and he said that the cauldron is not yet full. The dobdo don't push much in the dark areas at the end of the hall, but do push tremendously in the middle section where some light comes through. The <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. བོད་པ] 1. A person from Central Tibet (tib. དབུས) or sometimes someone from political Tibet in contrast to persons from Kham and Amdo. 2. Böpa is also used nowadays as a general name for all ethnic Tibetans.">böba</span> monks who have done this for many years could hold the sola so firm that even when they were pushed hard and they do not let the thukpa fall even the thukpa become protuded on the sola and some melted butter would splash out. The dobdo while waiting for the order to serve, when they were told to raise your hands up, they would hold their ladle straight up in the air and serve the thukpa when they were told "serve the thukpa" [Tib. ཞུས་བཞེས་ཐུག] and then they would be told to "turn east" [Tib. ཁ་ཤར་ལ་སློག] and serve the thukpa. There was a saying that If you don't serve quickly, there would be shortage of thukpa. So they serve the thukpa very quickly and they would tell them to get out. If when you are running back and forth you slow down a little the chabril and <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. ཇ་མ] The monk(s) in charge of a monastery&#x27;s kitchen.">jama</span> would hit you with stick on the head. At the areas around the long pillars where there is more light they rush and push a lot and not much pushing in the dark area in the east and the west. And when you are going out, you have to wave the ladles many times, otherwise the guy behind you would grab you and throw you against the wall or to the floor. If you get thrown down, everyone would step on you. There is no risk to your life if you fall but it is humiliating. <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. སྒོ་མང] One of the large colleges in Drepung Monastery.">Gomang</span> is special and different from other <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. གྲྭ་ཚང] A &quot;college&quot; within a monastery, for example, in Drepung Monastery there were four main tratsang: Gomang, Loseling, Deyang and Ngagpa. These tratsang were property owning corporate entities and included monks who were organized into residential dormitories called Khamtsen.">tratsang</span>, you are not allowed to add water when there is shortage of thukapa. If it runs out, the sponsor would pay the money called thugdö [Tib. ཐུག་དོད] to the monks who didn't get the thukpa. Other tratsang would add water to avoid running out. I only remember them running out once when I was a new monk. At that time, the sponsor gave 5 <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. སྲང] A unit of traditional Tibetan currency. It was also called ngüsang [tib. དངུལ་སྲང]. 50 nügsang = 1 dotse; 10 sho = 1 nügsang; 20 5-karma coins = 1 ngüsang. There were also paper currency notes of 7-sang, 25-sang, and 10-sang denominations.">sang</span> to each monk which was a lot, so I was thinking I wish I could have sat where the thukpa ran out because we could buy a lot of things with 5 sang.

**A:**  No. I don't think people really went this far. But the ladle is very large that your bowl couldn't hold it. When they serve, they hold it at the end of the ladle, so their thumb would touch the <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. ཐུག་པ] 1.

The regular monks lay down a napkin under their bowl and when they get the two ladles, some falls off onto the napkin. They would eat some thukpa and then tie the bowl with the napkin and take this back to their shag. I have seen in ones own row where some thukpa servers serve the amount of two bowls for their friends and they have to do this secretly. But I haven't seen anybody pouring the full sola over in the cloak. There was some unclear talk about this, maybe one person have done that in the past, but I didn't see anybody doing this in my time.

I don't think that is true. But I have seen that if there is some meat piece left at the bottom of sola when you run back into the runkhang to get more thukpa, the thukpa servers would eat some.

But in my time Kündeling only gave a loose thukpa as did Detru [Tib. སྡེ་དྲུག].   

**Q:**  Did you push and rush etc?   

**A:**  No. The <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. ཐུག་པ] 1. A porridge or gruel-like soup typically made with tsamba, and if available, meat and cheese. 2. Noodle dishes in broth.">thukpa</span> is too loose for this. The <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. ཚོགས་ཆེན] The main assembly hall of a monastery. The assembly hall for the monastery as a whole.">tsogchen</span> has no sola of its own and ladle for the thukpa. So we use the tea container chabtra of the <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. གྲྭ་ཚང] A &quot;college&quot; within a monastery, for example, in Drepung Monastery there were four main tratsang: Gomang, Loseling, Deyang and Ngagpa. These tratsang were property owning corporate entities and included monks who were organized into residential dormitories called Khamtsen.">tratsang</span> for the thukpa also. First these are used for tea then we pour the thukpa in them and serve. We serve them from the spout, we don't need ladle. On the Dalai Lama's <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. དགེ་ཤེས] An advanced degree earned by scholar monks.">geshe</span> exam, it was a real rice gruel thukpa. From the two bigger tratsang, they sent about 100 chagde each. They also gave them each a sola. The tratsang's chagde met and they told them "if there is any controversy, [Tib. ལབ་རྒྱུ་གླེང་རྒྱུ], like rushing and pushing you would be expelled from the monastery at once. The government told us about this and monastery also have decided to do this. So rushing and pushing is not allowed. <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. སྒོ་མང] One of the large colleges in Drepung Monastery.">Gomang</span> is considered as the elder tratsang and <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. བློ་གསལ་གླིང] One of the main colleges in Drepung Monastery.">Loseling</span> the younger. So we would send the servers of thukpa by tratsang seniority, first the senior tratsang (gomang). The thukpa was a great one. The rice for Drepung was supplied by one sponsor who was called Yeshe Gyentsen [Tib. ཡེ་ཤེས་རྒྱལ་མཚན] from Tö [Tib. སྟོད] a big business man. I heard that were 4 sponsors for the rice and they compared the quality of the rice and Yeshe Gyentsen supplied for Drepung. The government had rice but they could not stop the sponsors because the government could use the rice wherever they want. The thukpa was great and there were too many dry fruites that the dry fruits splattered when serving. When they served the thukpa, the <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. རྩེ་དྲུང] A monk official in the Tibetan government.">tsidrung</span> came into the rows and told the servers to serve the thukpa well. The excess thukpa was all given to beggars and the people coming for the pilgrimage.   

**Q:**  When was the <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. དགེ་ཤེས] An advanced degree earned by scholar monks.">geshe</span> exam?   

**A:**  In 1958, on the 1st of the 8th lunar month, the Dalai Lama came to Drepung and stayed till about 24th and he also went to the top of the mountain [Tib. དབུ་རྩེ] behind Drepung and burnt incense and <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. ཁ་བཏགས] A Tibetan ceremonial scarf given to lamas, visitors, etc.">khata</span> and he then he went to the mountain top Genphel Uste [Tib. དགེ་འཕེལ་དབུ་རྩེ] and stayed over night in the hermitage. One day, he also went for the circumambulation around Drepung. He made the offerings to the 4 <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. གྲྭ་ཚང] A &quot;college&quot; within a monastery, for example, in Drepung Monastery there were four main tratsang: Gomang, Loseling, Deyang and Ngagpa. These tratsang were property owning corporate entities and included monks who were organized into residential dormitories called Khamtsen.">tratsang</span> and went for the pilgrimage also and the <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. ཚོགས་ཆེན] The main assembly hall of a monastery. The assembly hall for the monastery as a whole.">tsogchen</span> and then went to Sera. Normally the young monks in each courtyard would practice reciting their memorized texts for 2 hrs, but when the Dalai Lama came they divided up the boys in the grades below uma into two shifts and had them reciting for one shift till midnight and after midnight another shift who continued until dawn.   

**Q:**  Where would they recite the prayers?   

**A:**  They recite in the courtyard. There were two inspectors checking on this making the rounds-one was shengo and one was <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. གྲྭ་ཚང] A &quot;college&quot; within a monastery, for example, in Drepung Monastery there were four main tratsang: Gomang, Loseling, Deyang and Ngagpa.

The entire monastery was like that. And during the Dalai Lama stay, everyone had to go to <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. ཚོགས] 1. A prayer assembly meeting in monasteries when all the monks come to an assembly hall and chant prayers together. 2. An offering made of tsamba, butter and dry cheese in the shape of a cone.">tsog</span> and <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. ཆོས་ར] The special grove (&quot;dharma grove&quot;) in monasteries where monks formally met to practice debating.">chöra</span> and the gegö would pattrol. They couldn't stay in the <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. 1. ཤག, 2. ཞག] 1. The apartment/room of a monk. 2. The butter fat that coagulates on the top of butter-tea when the tea is left to sit for some time. If the tea had been made with a lot of butter, this layer could be thick enough to scoop off and save to later sell or eat separately. The senior monks are usually served tea with a lot of shag.">shag</span> unless they were in retreat or sick. If some one stayed in the shag recklessly, they would get scolded. And those under the uma grade could not go for the circumambulation around Drepung during Dalai Lama's stay. And if those above the uma grade go for the circumambulation, they have to go back to shag right away and were not allowed to sit on the rocks and talk. And in courtyard, had to go right into the shag and not allowed to sit on the benches in the courtyard and talk.   

**Q:**  When can you keep <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. དགེ་ཕྲུག] 1. Student. 2. Disciple. 3. Commonly the name for monks living with a gegen or teacher. These are more like wards than real disciples.">gidru</span> in <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. སྒོ་མང] One of the large colleges in Drepung Monastery.">Gomang</span> and Gungru? Was there any rule for that?   

**A:**  Yes, there was. From the grade <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. ཁ་དོག་དཀར་དམར] The first class or stage in the monastic düdra curriculum.">khatog garmar</span> till döndönjö [Tib. འདོན་འདོན་ཆོག] there were 6 grades. After that, Shungwog [Tib. གཞུང་འོག], Shungong [Tib. གཞུང་གོང], Kabdangpo [Tib. སྐབས་དང་པོ] and then Pharchin [Tib. ཕར་ཕྱིན] and then uma. Altogether 5 years. After 11 years you reach the uma grade. At this time, this grade by itself would have 2 monks over seeing the reciting, <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. སྐྱོར་དཔོན] The monastic official who functions as the main teacher in the Dharma Grove (chöra) where monks go to study debating and logic.">gyorpön</span> as the leader. The <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. ཁང་ཚན] A monastic residential unit in which monks from specific geographic areas lived. These were corporate entities with property and internal officials. Some large khamtsen had smaller subordinate units called mi tshan. Khamtsen were part of tratsang (colleges). For example, Hamdong Khamtsen was part of Gomang College in Drepung Monastery.">khamtsen</span> lend a house and pots etc. for this in turns [each having this job 1 year]. There was a ritual called düsang [Tib. དུས་བཟང] called uma semkyepa. [Tib. བདུ་མ་སེམས་སྐྱེད་པ]. The 2 gyorpön would take a <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. ཁ་བཏགས] A Tibetan ceremonial scarf given to lamas, visitors, etc.">khata</span> at this time to the <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. སྒོ་མང] One of the large colleges in Drepung Monastery.">Gomang</span> abbot and would say, "the reciting of our grade has finished, so please give us the permission to keep one <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. དགེ་ཕྲུག] 1. Student. 2. Disciple. 3. Commonly the name for monks living with a gegen or teacher. These are more like wards than real disciples.">gidru</span> and give us the permission to keep a churn and the permission to open one side of the curtain".   

**Q:**  Usually, you are not allowed to keep the churn, right>   

**A:**  Yes.   

**Q:**  How could you make butter tea without the churn?   

**A:**  Who know's! This was a custom from the early times. After asking these pemissions we don't have to go to recite the texts for two hours.   

**Q:**  If you don't study <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. དཔེ་ཆ] Religious books/texts, scriptures.">pecha</span> how could you reach uma grade?   

**A:**  Whether you are a <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. དཔེ་ཆ་བ] A monk studying the monastic philosophical curriculum. A scholar monk.">pechawa</span> or not a pechawa, you move up with your grade year by year and you have to attend the same grade. When we reach düwa [Tib. འདུལ་བ] or dzö [Tib. མཛོད] then they would hold a düsang and then the pechawa would be merged to karam [Tib. བཀའ་རམས] like karam sarma [Tib. བཀའ་རམས་གསར་མ] but we, the non pechawa are then simply called <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. བླ་རྒྱུད་པ] A term for the common monks in a monastery (in contrast to the scholar monks who were actively studying the Buddhist doctrine).">lagyüba</span> and in the <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. ཆོས་ར] The special grove (&quot;dharma grove&quot;) in monasteries where monks formally met to practice debating.">chöra</span> we all sit together, but there is no grade for us. When you reach dzö grade, they hold the düsang before we end it and they do the counting and say that our grade has this amount of money. We use this commune money for performing rituals when the pechawa go into karam and we stay as lagyüba. And in the chöra when two karampa starts <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. མཚན་ཉིད] Buddhist dialectics. This is taught after the six-year curriculum called düdra.">tsenyi</span> debate with the higher grades, then the <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. དགེ་སྐོས] The main disciplinary official in a monastic college (tratsang).">gegö</span> says you older monks [Tib. བླ་རྒན] can leave together. The other grades aren't permitted to leave immediately although there were monks who don't study <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. དཔེ་ཆ] Religious books/texts, scriptures.">pecha</span> among them.   

**Q:**  At one time, there was a big fight between the <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. ཨ་མདོ] One of the three main Tibetan sub-ethnic areas. It is located in the northeast of the Tibetan Plateau mostly in today&#x27;s Qinghai Province. A person from Amdo is called an Amdowa.">Amdo</span> and the <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. བོད་པ] 1. A person from Central Tibet (tib. དབུས) or sometimes someone from political Tibet in contrast to persons from Kham and Amdo. 2. Böpa is also used nowadays as a general name for all ethnic Tibetans.">böba</span> in <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. སྒོ་མང] One of the large colleges in Drepung Monastery.">Gomang</span> when they were serving <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. ཐུག་པ] 1. A porridge or gruel-like soup typically made with tsamba, and if available, meat and cheese. 2. Noodle dishes in broth.">thukpa</span>. Böba were saying that when Geyog Chungdag [Tib. ཆུང་དག] went to get the first place, an Amdo stabbed a böba and took his sola and went to get the first place. The Amdo were saying that Jayog Wöser Künga [Tib. འོད་ཟེར་ཀུན་དགའ] put the thukpa in the sola and gave it to Thusö [Tib. ཐུབ་བཟོད] and he kept the thukpa in his cloak and when Thusö stood up, the Amdo grabbed the thukpa and then they got into fight. Which one is true? Later, they got beaten with switches, right?   

**A:**  Yes, the reason for getting beaten with switches was because after the <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. ཐུག་པ] 1. A porridge or gruel-like soup typically made with tsamba, and if available, meat and cheese. 2. Noodle dishes in broth.">thukpa</span> was served, there was very bad fighting outside as well. Altogether, the shengo seized about more than 16-17 monks and beat them a lot with switches. Some were expelled from the monastery. A few of other <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. ཨ་མདོ] One of the three main Tibetan sub-ethnic areas. It is located in the northeast of the Tibetan Plateau mostly in today&#x27;s Qinghai Province. A person from Amdo is called an Amdowa.">Amdo</span> who were wealthy were able to flee to India and they didn't come back. They fled because they thought if they stayed, they would be beaten with switches and get expelled from the monastery and this would all be humiliating, so instead they fled. There weren't many khamba, mostly Amdo and <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. བོད་པ] 1. A person from Central Tibet (tib. དབུས) or sometimes someone from political Tibet in contrast to persons from Kham and Amdo. 2. Böpa is also used nowadays as a general name for all ethnic Tibetans.">böpa</span>. I remember among the böpa, there was <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. ལྡབ་ལྡོབ] A mildly deviant type of fighting or &quot;punk&quot; monk who engaged in fighting and other unusual behaviors for monks in traditional Tibet&#x27;s large monasteries.">dobdo</span> Thusö, Geyog Mama [Tib. མ་མ] and Chungdag and there were many others. I don't remember the names. The fight started when a <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. ཇ་གཡོག] Assistant to the Jama (The monk who is in charge of a monastery&#x27;s kitchen).">jayog</span> [Wöser Künga] poured some thukpa in a sola before the time and secretly kept it and gave it to him and then he rushed to get the first place. The Amdo and the <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. ཁམས་པ] A person from the Kham region, a Tibetan from the Khampa (Khamba) sub-cultural group.">Khampa</span> said this is not okay. There is no such custom. If we leave this as it is, then later the custom would become established and there would be lot of controversy and there would be unrest [Tib. མི་བདེ་བ] for many people and they said that they are going to beat each other. That's how the fight erupted though the fight was not that severe because the Amdo were strong. The fight started in the rows inside the <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. ཚོགས] 1. A prayer assembly meeting in monasteries when all the monks come to an assembly hall and chant prayers together. 2. An offering made of tsamba, butter and dry cheese in the shape of a cone.">tsog</span> and all the monks got up.   

**Q:**  Were you there at that time?   

**A:**  Yes, I was there. And the monastic officials said, "sit down in the rows " and finally got everyone to sit down. The fighting continued in the <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. ཚོགས] 1. A prayer assembly meeting in monasteries when all the monks come to an assembly hall and chant prayers together. 2. An offering made of tsamba, butter and dry cheese in the shape of a cone.">tsog</span> for a long time because the monks became kind of bias or prejudice [Tib. ཕྱོགས་ཞེན] and the monks said that this is not good and the tsog ended.

The Gomang abbot was a Hor called Temba Chödrak [Tib. བསྟན་པ་ཆོས་གྲགས]. He said now we have to eliminate the rushing and pushing, thugyag. If we allow this to continue there would be a terrible trouble in future which would hurt the tratsang. So they eliminated the thugyag. The <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. ཨ་མདོ] One of the three main Tibetan sub-ethnic areas. It is located in the northeast of the Tibetan Plateau mostly in today&#x27;s Qinghai Province. A person from Amdo is called an Amdowa.">Amdo</span> dobdo got beaten with switches terribly. At that time, there was a late monk called Demjog [Tib. བདེ་མཆོག] who was holding a penknife and there was a Amdo trying to get the second place thugyag and the Amdo tried to rob his sola and got hurt with the penknife. Demjo thought that he would drop the pot and the Amdo would pick it up and go to get the first place. Then Thusö already went ahead and got the first place and there was some disturbance but the tsog could continue and then the sponsors came down from the roof top.   

**Q:**  After the <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. ཚོགས] 1. A prayer assembly meeting in monasteries when all the monks come to an assembly hall and chant prayers together. 2. An offering made of tsamba, butter and dry cheese in the shape of a cone.">tsog</span>, the <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. ཨ་མདོ] One of the three main Tibetan sub-ethnic areas. It is located in the northeast of the Tibetan Plateau mostly in today&#x27;s Qinghai Province.

A person from Central Tibet (tib. དབུས) or sometimes someone from political Tibet in contrast to persons from Kham and Amdo. 2. Böpa is also used nowadays as a general name for all ethnic Tibetans.">böba</span>, right?   

**A:**  Yes. The <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. ཨ་མདོ] One of the three main Tibetan sub-ethnic areas. It is located in the northeast of the Tibetan Plateau mostly in today&#x27;s Qinghai Province. A person from Amdo is called an Amdowa.">Amdo</span> said this is not fair to keep the <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. ཐུག་པ] 1.
