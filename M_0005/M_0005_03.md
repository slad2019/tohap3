**Q:**  If the Khampas go, the Amdos will go together, right?   

**A:**  Yes. There were some Khambas going with the Amdos. The one who got hurt with a penknife called Demjo [Tib. བདེ་མཆོག] was from my homeland. But he looks like a böba.   

**Q:**  How did they use the penknife?   

**A:**  When the other tukpa server was rushing over, he used the penknife thinking that the other <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. ཐུག་པ] 1. A porridge or gruel-like soup typically made with tsamba, and if available, meat and cheese. 2. Noodle dishes in broth.">thukpa</span> server would lose the thukpa container sola [Tib. ཟོ་ལག] and then he could take over the sola and go ahead. There were some big fighting in the tsog.   

**Q:**  When they fight in the <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. ཚོགས] 1. A prayer assembly meeting in monasteries when all the monks come to an assembly hall and chant prayers together. 2. An offering made of tsamba, butter and dry cheese in the shape of a cone.">tsog</span> would they hit each other with ladles?   

**A:**  In general it was kind of chaos [Tib. ཟང་ངི་ཟིང་གནི], but there was not that much fighting in the <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. ཚོགས] 1. A prayer assembly meeting in monasteries when all the monks come to an assembly hall and chant prayers together. 2. An offering made of tsamba, butter and dry cheese in the shape of a cone.">tsog</span> where they hit each other and there couldn't be much fighting because 3/4th the monks in the tsog were from the long distance and 1/4th are <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. བོད་པ] 1. A person from Central Tibet (tib. དབུས) or sometimes someone from political Tibet in contrast to persons from Kham and Amdo. 2. Böpa is also used nowadays as a general name for all ethnic Tibetans.">böba</span> because there was a big difference on the number, they didn't fight much. In the past, there was a fight where the shengo came to arrest them. The reason for the fighting was that they [<span class "tooltip" data-text "[tib. ཨ་མདོ] One of the three main Tibetan sub-ethnic areas. It is located in the northeast of the Tibetan Plateau mostly in today&#x27;s Qinghai Province. A person from Amdo is called an Amdowa.">Amdo</span>] were saying that they will kill such and such person. At that time, <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. ཁམས་པ] A person from the Kham region, a Tibetan from the Khampa (Khamba) sub-cultural group.">Khampa</span> Demchog's hand got hurt with a penknife and he was sick. Some Amdo therefore went to Demchog's shag. They told him "we don't have anything to tell you, but please tell us where is the assistant of the <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. དགེ་སྐོས] The main disciplinary official in a monastic college (tratsang).">gegö</span>, Geyog Mama [Tib. དགེ་གཡོག་མ་མ] is" But he stood on the böba side and didn't tell him where Geyog Mama is. He said "I don't know where he has gone". Actually he knew where Geyog Mama is. On that night, Geyog Mama fled to Phembo [Tib. འཕན་པོ] and stayed in the house because he was afraid that he knew he is going to be killed and Thusö [Tib. ཐུབ་བཟོད] also fled. Because Demchog didn't tell them the where about of Geyog Mama, so the Amdo beat him up badly hitting him with knife or shabshag [?] on his head and his head was torn up [Tib. དབྲལ] and the Amdos got blood on their hands and they washed their hands in his pot which had left over tea, then they left. They [Amdo] couldn't catch Mama and Thusö and they didn't return to Drepung until after several years during 2 gegö and shengo were changed. Then some of these Amdo had gone to India and some died and the organization of the Amdo had sort of dispersed though there were few of them left who returned to the monastery. Then they abolished the running and rushing when serving <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. ཐུག་པ] 1. A porridge or gruel-like soup typically made with tsamba, and if available, meat and cheese. 2. Noodle dishes in broth.">thukpa</span> and they served the thukba slowly.   

**Q:**  When was this?   

**A:**  This was made by the abbot just after that incident.   

**Q:**  What year was that according to the western calandar?   

**A:**  I am not sure since in old days we didn't really have these western years and dates. I think it was about 1936-1837.   

**Q:**  You must be young at that time?   

**A:**  Yes. At that time, we only count the elements and animal years such as the Iron Sheep [Tib. ལྕགས་ལུག] year.   

**Q:**  You count the 60 years cycle, rabchung [Tib. རབ་བྱུང], right?   

**A:**  We don't talk much about rabchung also, but we can see the rabchung in some old agreeements.   

**Q:**  Was this during the Reting Regency?   

**A:**  It was during Reting's Regency. Then after few years they eliminated the custom of rushing and competing in <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. ཐུག་པ] 1. A porridge or gruel-like soup typically made with tsamba, and if available, meat and cheese. 2. Noodle dishes in broth.">thukpa</span> serving and it was said that it harms the <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. གྲྭ་ཚང] A &quot;college&quot; within a monastery, for example, in Drepung Monastery there were four main tratsang: Gomang, Loseling, Deyang and Ngagpa. These tratsang were property owning corporate entities and included monks who were organized into residential dormitories called Khamtsen.">tratsang</span> and makes the tratsang to decline. For example, the number of sponsors making offerings also reduced. The <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. དཔེ་ཆ་བ] A monk studying the monastic philosophical curriculum. A scholar monk.">pechawa</span> had more misfortunes [Tib. གེགས་དབང་བར་ཆད] and the tratsang itself had more difficulties and misfortunes. So we said that it is not okay to elinimate it because it seems that it had a nessecity [Tib. དགོས་པ]. There were lot of discussions back and forth and then the tratsang reinstated it. This way to serve thukpa was really good and without it, the <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. ཚོགས] 1. A prayer assembly meeting in monasteries when all the monks come to an assembly hall and chant prayers together. 2. An offering made of tsamba, butter and dry cheese in the shape of a cone.">tsog</span> seems to be dull that there is nothing to think about and pay attention when the tsog was held. [laughter]   

**Q:**  It was more bustling [Tib. འཁྲུགས་པོ] when there is the rushing, right?   

**A:**  Yes, it was very bustling.   

**Q:**  The <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. བོད་པ] 1. A person from Central Tibet (tib. དབུས) or sometimes someone from political Tibet in contrast to persons from Kham and Amdo. 2. Böpa is also used nowadays as a general name for all ethnic Tibetans.">böba</span> had the <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. ལྡབ་ལྡོབ] A mildly deviant type of fighting or &quot;punk&quot; monk who engaged in fighting and other unusual behaviors for monks in traditional Tibet&#x27;s large monasteries.">dobdo</span> tobtsang and the jump [Tib. མཆོང་རྒྱག] and the monks from the long distance didn't have that. So didn't they think that they should also have one? Was there any rule on this?   

**A:**  This was upto one's own choice and they didn't do that. There was no official rule prohibiting Khambas and Amdos from joining <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. ལྟོ་ཚང] 1. The club of the Dobdos. 2. A group of people eating together.">tobtsang</span> and whoever is allowed to join it. There were a few of them joined the tobtsang I think though I don't remember clearly.   

**Q:**  There wasn't any <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. ལྟོ་ཚང] 1. The club of the Dobdos. 2. A group of people eating together.">tobtsang</span> set up by the long distance monks, right?   

**A:**  Yes. They would not.   

**Q:**  Why?   

**A:**  As to why the <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. ཨ་མདོ] One of the three main Tibetan sub-ethnic areas. It is located in the northeast of the Tibetan Plateau mostly in today&#x27;s Qinghai Province. A person from Amdo is called an Amdowa.">Amdo</span> and <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. ཁམས་པ] A person from the Kham region, a Tibetan from the Khamba (Khampa) sub-cultural group.">Khamba</span> didn't have <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. ལྟོ་ཚང] 1. The club of the Dobdos. 2. A group of people eating together.">tobtsang</span>, it was because if we did so, it would have harmed the <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. གྲྭ་ཚང] A &quot;college&quot; within a monastery, for example, in Drepung Monastery there were four main tratsang: Gomang, Loseling, Deyang and Ngagpa. These tratsang were property owning corporate entities and included monks who were organized into residential dormitories called Khamtsen.">tratsang</span> on studying <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. མཚན་ཉིད] Buddhist dialectics. This is taught after the six-year curriculum called düdra.">tsenyi</span> pecha. We would have become spoiled and ignore the study and discipline [Tib. ཁྲེབ་ཏོ]. If we did that, the majority of the monks were from the long distance and if they become kind of powerful, they might bully each other, so we would not join the tobtsang. At first, they didn't have <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. རྩམ་པ] The traditional Tibetan staple food that consists of grain that is roasted (popped), usually in sand, and then ground into a flour.">tsampa</span> to eat and then after a year or so they start going to villages to do some trade and work as servant for <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. སྐུ་དྲག] 1. A member of the lay aristocracy. 2. Title for government lay and monk officials. 3. A name occasionally used for the top leaders/officials in a monastery.">kudrak</span> and then they could make their living and become kind of the traders. And the better ones from the long distance would devote themselves to study and most of the <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. དགེ་ཤེས] An advanced degree earned by scholar monks.">geshe</span> who are knowledgeable and famous are from long distance. From when I joined the monastery there was only one <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. བོད་པ] 1. A person from Central Tibet (tib. དབུས) or sometimes someone from political Tibet in contrast to persons from Kham and Amdo. 2. Böpa is also used nowadays as a general name for all ethnic Tibetans.">böba</span> from Hamdong called Gen Ngawangla [Tib. རྒན་ངག་དབང་ལགས] who got the first or the second place among the geshe lharampa [Tib. ལྷ་རམས་པ] and became a famous geshe and particularly he was skillful on poltics. At that time, people were not attentive of the politics and we haven't heard about politics then. In the past, Ngawang La had told the lama gyüba [Tib. བླ་མ་རྒྱུད་པ], "you should not leave your most valuable things like carpets here. I will take them to India and I will tell somebody to keep them. I don't know about this chaos situation." He didn't say Chinese will take it. But the monks said. "no, these are precious things of monastery and it is regarded as a bad omen to take them out of the threshhold. Later, when the situation was just like what Gen Nagwang La said, the <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. བླ་མ་རྒྱུད་པ] The name for the monks enrolled in the Upper and Lower Tantric Monastic Colleges in Lhasa (gyüme and gyütö).">lama gyüpa</span> were saying "it was too bad that we didn't listent to what Gen Nagwang La said." At that time, people only praised him on religion, but nobody praised him that he was skillful on politician.   

**Q:**  Is he still alive?   

**A:**  He died in Mongode in India. He set the <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. རྒྱུད་སྨད] The Lower Tantric Monastic College in Lhasa.">Gyüme</span> Tratsang and also help the <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. གྲྭ་ཚང] A &quot;college&quot; within a monastery, for example, in Drepung Monastery there were four main tratsang: Gomang, Loseling, Deyang and Ngagpa. These tratsang were property owning corporate entities and included monks who were organized into residential dormitories called Khamtsen.">tratsang</span> here. He was fortunate on doing everything. After that, there were 1-2 <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. དགེ་ཤེས] An advanced degree earned by scholar monks.">geshe</span> who got the second place. Otherwise, all the geshe were Mongols and <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. ཨ་མདོ] One of the three main Tibetan sub-ethnic areas. It is located in the northeast of the Tibetan Plateau mostly in today&#x27;s Qinghai Province. A person from Amdo is called an Amdowa.">Amdo</span>. In the past, there was only one Mongolia and there were many famous Monglian and Amdo geshe and there were two from the north, Hor among the ones who took the first and second geshe lharampa. But after that the Soviet Union made the Outter Mongolia which is located near by and Inner Mongolia became part of China. Among the Mongolians, there was only 5-6% who doesn't learn pecha. There were many Khampas, Amdos and <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. བོད་པ] 1. A person from Central Tibet (tib. དབུས) or sometimes someone from political Tibet in contrast to persons from Kham and Amdo. 2. Böpa is also used nowadays as a general name for all ethnic Tibetans.">böba</span>, but there were just a few who study pecha.   

**Q:**  When did the <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. བླ་རྒྱུད་པ] A term for the common monks in a monastery (in contrast to the scholar monks who were actively studying the Buddhist doctrine).">lagyüba</span> and <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. དཔེ་ཆ་བ] A monk studying the monastic philosophical curriculum. A scholar monk.">pechawa</span> got into trouble?   

**A:**  It was in 1958.   

**Q:**  What was the cause of the trouble from the beginning?   

**A:**  You've probably heard about this already, so it must be similar and I don't need to tell you. This wasn't a trouble between the monks from long distances and the short distances.   

**Q:**  Who do you think was wrong?   

**A:**  Later, gradually when I was awaken from unawareness [Tib. རྨོངས་གཉིད་སད], I think in fact, the <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. དཔེ་ཆ་བ] A monk studying the monastic philosophical curriculum. A scholar monk.">pechawa</span> had little bit reason because the <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. གྲྭ་ཚང] A &quot;college&quot; within a monastery, for example, in Drepung Monastery there were four main tratsang: Gomang, Loseling, Deyang and Ngagpa. These tratsang were property owning corporate entities and included monks who were organized into residential dormitories called Khamtsen.">tratsang</span> need people to study pecha. But at t<span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. ཞྭ་མོ; ch. 戴帽] 1. A regular hat, cap. 2. A common political slang term (label) used for people who were classified as class enemies or reactionaries. It was used politically as, &quot;They put the hat on him,&quot; or &quot;They never took his hat off.&quot;">hat</span> time, a fewer people got more benefit and more people got less benefit and it was not convenient for them. Normally, the salary was paid in front of the main gate, <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. སྒོ་མཆོར] The area outside of the monastic assembly hall that is supported by tall pillars.">gomchor</span> [Tib. སྒོ་མཆོར]. At this time, they didn't need to hold the <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. ཚོགས] 1. A prayer assembly meeting in monasteries when all the monks come to an assembly hall and chant prayers together. 2. An offering made of tsamba, butter and dry cheese in the shape of a cone.">tsog</span> for paying the salary. The officials paying the salary would be seated in a row and when the early miday, gungtsig [Tib. དགུང་ཚིགས] <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. ཆོས་ར] The special grove (&quot;dharma grove&quot;) in monasteries where monks formally met to practice debating.">chöra</span> was over, the monks would come and file by and get the salary and then do a circuit of tratsang and go back to their shag. It was very convenient. At this time, the abbot said you should pay the salary in the chöra. If it was paid there, then all have to go and sit and wear the cloak and carry the hat and go to the tsog and there is no time for the debate. And the pechawa who have finished <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. དགེ་ཤེས] An advanced degree earned by scholar monks.">geshe</span> don't have to go to the chöra so they too would not get the salary if they didn't go to the chöra. So this was disagreed by the majority of the monks, but the pechawa seems to have agreed because it was suggested by the abbot.   

**Q:**  Did the abbot make the plan at first?   

**A:**  It doesn't seem that the abbot made the plan. Later when we asked around, it seems it started in Hor Mitsen. The main one was the late Geshe Dorje Wönbar[Tib. རྡོར་རྗེ་འོད་འབར]. Then there was the late karam kyorpön from <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. ཆུ་ཤུར] The name of a town, district and county at the confluence of the Lhasa and Tsangpo Rivers.">Chushü</span> [Tib. ཆུ་ཤུར]. Then there was the Gendün Thönden [Tib. དགེ་འདུན་དོན་ལྡན] who was nicknamed the old man, chari porto [? spor to] who is now a teacher in the Cadre's School [Tib. ཟང་གན་྾ཨུཨེ]. He was also quite old then. These people weren't good in their work and whatever they did had a bad luck. Some of these were <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. དགེ་ཤེས] An advanced degree earned by scholar monks.">geshe</span> and some were not yet and they were saying in the Hor Mitsen "we <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. དཔེ་ཆ་བ] A monk studying the monastic philosophical curriculum. A scholar monk.">pechawa</span> have become poor, we need some benefit and convenience. If we do this, then the number of pechawa in <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. སྒོ་མང] One of the large colleges in Drepung Monastery.">Gomang</span> will become more. They discussed this and made the plan and this was the bad cause and they behave kind of stubborn [Tib. མཁྲེགས་པོ] and then they went to the abbot and reported this matter and the abbot thought that if it is to help the pechawa studies, it is good and they had already reported the government about this. And the government said, "if this is beneficial for the monks who are content with inferior robe, housing and almls and liked renouncing and meditation [Tib. འཕགས་པའི་རིགས་བཞི], you can do as the abbot had reported." And they had given a seal. [Note: he is wrong, this was the divination done by the Dalai lama]. And then the <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. ཕྱག་སྦུག] A manager (of estates and endowments) of a monastic college or monastic khamtsen.">chabu</span> and the <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. གྲྭ་ཚང] A &quot;college&quot; within a monastery, for example, in Drepung Monastery there were four main tratsang: Gomang, Loseling, Deyang and Ngagpa. These tratsang were property owning corporate entities and included monks who were organized into residential dormitories called Khamtsen.">tratsang</span> umdze who wee from Hor Mitsen instigated and group of monks said, "those officials aren't acting honestly and we have a hope to get the grain salary increased and there are also other works to do, but they might make obsticle [Tib. འགོག་རྐྱེན] for these. So now, it is better to make the matter more wide or expand the scope [Tib. རྒྱ་ཆེ་རུ་བཏང] because the matter wouldn't be settled here even by the laji". So they went to the tratsang chabu office and tied those officials to the pillar. Then the laji and other officials came and said "it is rediculese [Tib. དཔེ་སྲིད་ཀྱི་མ་རེད] to do like this. You are not allowed to do this" Then after it became conspicuose the leaders [Tib. དཔོན་པོ] petitioned the government. The government settled it honestly. The government proclaimed "all the people who got tied and the people who tied them and all the people who were there and yelled would be expelled from monastery no matter they are abbot or geshe or whatever". The Dalai Lama himself made this decision. For one month the government interrogated and invetigated. Then one day they called about 17-18 people from both sides to Norbulinga. I attended a meeting for a short time, so I was made to do prostration from among the <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. བླ་རྒྱུད་པ] A term for the common monks in a monastery (in contrast to the scholar monks who were actively studying the Buddhist doctrine).">lagyüba</span> side. I went to 2 lagyüba meetings in chöra. For this reason, I had to do the prostration for 5-6 days. I had to start the prostration from the time when they start the <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. དྲུང་ཇ] The daily rite of serving tea to Tibetan government monk officials. It started at about 9 a.m. and lasted for about an hour. When the Dalai Lama&#x27;s secretariat (tib. ཙེ་ག) was in the Potala, it was held there, and when it was in Norbulinga, it was held there. All monk officials in Lhasa were expected to attend.">trungja</span> to the end. It was very hard as it was winter just before the New Year and there wasn't sunshine in that place. The place where we had to prostrate was stone floor. And we were not allowed to wear garments with sleeves. We would go home after the trungja was over. Two <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. རྩེ་དྲུང] A monk official in the Tibetan government.">tsidrung</span> were put in charge of our prostration. They would check from a list to make sure all were there. We would wait outside till trungja started then the tsidrung would call us and then put us in there and we had to do prostration facing the tsidrung. The monks above us were all expelled.   

**Q:**  What was the aim of tying them up to the pillars.   

**A:**  Before this, there was unity in the <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. སྒོ་མང] One of the large colleges in Drepung Monastery.">Gomang</span>, but later it almost became like there were 2 households when they pulled the <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. དཔེ་ཆ་བ] A monk studying the monastic philosophical curriculum. A scholar monk.">pechawa</span> apart. So we were saying that it is not good to have two households. It is better to have one household. In the <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. གྲྭ་ཚང] A &quot;college&quot; within a monastery, for example, in Drepung Monastery there were four main tratsang: Gomang, Loseling, Deyang and Ngagpa. These tratsang were property owning corporate entities and included monks who were organized into residential dormitories called Khamtsen.">tratsang</span>, the people in the the <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. གཞིས་ཀ] A manorial estate.">shiga</span>, the <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. མི་སེར] A term that can mean serf/bound subject as well as citizen, depending on context. For example, the miser of a lord would connote the bound subjects of that lord, whereas the miser of Tibet would connote citizens of Tibet.">miser</span>, the nomads, granary, <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. དངུལ་གཉེར] Accountant, bookkeeper, cashier. Someone in charge of cash.">ngünyer</span> must have been talking about specially helping the pechawa. And some <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. ཕྱག་སྦུག] A manager (of estates and endowments) of a monastic college or monastic khamtsen.">chabu</span> had relations with the pechawa in the Hor Mitsen and some people didn't know what was going on. Before that, the <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. བླ་རྒྱུད་པ] A term for the common monks in a monastery (in contrast to the scholar monks who were actively studying the Buddhist doctrine).">lagyüba</span> wanted more grain salary and they told Kündeling and got some from Kündeling but it didn't reach the majority of the monks well though the tratsang got it. This was our goal to stop happening these things.   

**Q:**  How did they decide? Where was the salary paid?   

**A:**  It was decided to pay in the same place in <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. སྒོ་མཆོར] The area outside of the monastic assembly hall that is supported by tall pillars.">gomchor</span> and it was said this time, we have implemented a lenient policy. But the government gave 3,000 <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. རྡོ་ཚད] A currency unit in traditional Tibet that was equal to 50 ngüsang.">dotse</span> as the donation endowment for the <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. དཔེ་ཆ་བ] A monk studying the monastic philosophical curriculum. A scholar monk.">pechawa</span> who go to <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. འཇང་དགུན་ཆོས] The special winter debating session for monks that was held annually in the area called Jang.">Jang günchö</span> and it was told to establish a new <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. དངུལ་གཉེར] Accountant, bookkeeper, cashier. Someone in charge of cash.">ngünyer</span> which will be the ngünyer of Jang günchö. But then the revolt took place. In the early times, regarding the income from the <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. གཞིས་ཀ] A manorial estate.">shiga</span>, the <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. མི་སེར] A term that can mean serf/bound subject as well as citizen, depending on context.

These tratsang were property owning corporate entities and included monks who were organized into residential dormitories called Khamtsen.">tratsang</span> and the expenditures were not clear in the tratsang and they were doing whatever is convenient for them. Later, all these new rules and regularities were fixed by Gungru Khenchen Temba Chönbe [Tib. གུང་རུ་མཁན་ཆེན་བསྟན་པ་ཆོས་འཕེལ] during 13th Dalai lama 's time. He fixed the number of different tsog held in a day and about the <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. ཆོས་ར] The special grove (&quot;dharma grove&quot;) in monasteries where monks formally met to practice debating.">chöra</span> and about the rituals performed in the chapel of the protective deities and how the incomes of the shiga and the nomads should be delivered to the tratsang nyertsang and how the <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. གཏོང་སྒོ] A monastic obligation to provide the food and other necessary items served at a monastic prayer assembly meeting or some other rite; this was often a required obligation for monastic officials at the end of their term of office.">tonggo</span> should be given to the monks.

**Q:**  I heard that the <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. དཔེ་ཆ་བ] A monk studying the monastic philosophical curriculum. A scholar monk.">pechawa</span> used money from the <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. གྲྭ་ཚང] A &quot;college&quot; within a monastery, for example, in Drepung Monastery there were four main tratsang: Gomang, Loseling, Deyang and Ngagpa.

I heard that this was later exposed in the struggle sessions. Was it true?   

**A:**  Yes, all the matters were exposed in the Hor Mitsen after the revolt. But I am not sure about the money. I did hear from many monks that they gave about 3,000 <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. ད་ཡང; ch. 大洋] A Chinese silver dollar that had the image of Yuan Shikai on its face. It was used by the Chinese government in Tibet in the 1950s because Tibetans did not accept Chinese paper currency.">dayang</span> to the monks.   

**Q:**  Trindor: I heard that they gave one <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. ད་ཡང; ch. 大洋] A Chinese silver dollar that had the image of Yuan Shikai on its face. It was used by the Chinese government in Tibet in the 1950s because Tibetans did not accept Chinese paper currency.">dayang</span> to each monks.   

**A:**  Yes. They used the remaining money and internally lent about 7,000-8,000 <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. ད་ཡང; ch. 大洋] A Chinese silver dollar that had the image of Yuan Shikai on its face. It was used by the Chinese government in Tibet in the 1950s because Tibetans did not accept Chinese paper currency.">dayang</span> to Hor Mitsen with a low interest through secret relations [Tib. གསང་ཐབས]. There was a lot of talk about this from the monks. Later, I heard that when people took out the things from the <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. གྲྭ་ཚང] A &quot;college&quot; within a monastery, for example, in Drepung Monastery there were four main tratsang: Gomang, Loseling, Deyang and Ngagpa. These tratsang were property owning corporate entities and included monks who were organized into residential dormitories called Khamtsen.">tratsang</span>, there was not much dayang left there though there were some other silver wares. The main backers were Kündeling Dzasa and he was asking Tsipön <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. རྣམ་གསལ་གླིང] The family name of a well-known aristocratic lay official.">Namseling</span>. Later, Tsipön Namseling, Trekhang Khenjung [Tib. བཀྲས་ཁང] and <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. རྒྱལ་རོང] A Khamtsen in Drepung Monastery.">Gyerong</span> [Tib. རྒྱལ་རོང] abbot were sent to negotiate between the Chinese and <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. ཆུ་བཞི་སྒང་དྲུག] The anti-Chinese Khamba insurgency force in Tibet that began in 1957 in Lhasa and launched an uprising against the Chinese the following year.

Before they left, Namseling told them not to have a big dispute over the salary issue. For the time, be careful and stay there and leave it quite. It is not worthy to make a shape [Tib. བཟོ་ཏ་བཟོ] for this. The best is to adhere to the order from the Dalai lama. If you cannot adhere to it, then at least don't disturb his mind.   

**Q:**  Did he say this to the <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. དཔེ་ཆ་བ] A monk studying the monastic philosophical curriculum. A scholar monk.">pechawa</span> or <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. བླ་རྒྱུད་པ] A term for the common monks in a monastery (in contrast to the scholar monks who were actively studying the Buddhist doctrine).">lagyüba</span>?   

**A:**  <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. རྣམ་གསལ་གླིང] The family name of a well-known aristocratic lay official.">Namseling</span> told this to Kündeling Dzasa. Once I was brought to the <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. བླ་རྒྱུད་པ] A term for the common monks in a monastery (in contrast to the scholar monks who were actively studying the Buddhist doctrine).">lagyüba</span> tsondu at Namseling's house and at that time he said this. He was about to cry. He was about to go to <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. ཆུ་བཞི་སྒང་དྲུག] The anti-Chinese Khamba insurgency force in Tibet that began in 1957 in Lhasa and launched an uprising against the Chinese the following year. The name means, &quot;four rivers and six mountain ranges,&quot; and refers to Eastern Tibet.">Chushigandru</span> and he said I have to go in 2-3 days to them to try to "apologize the <span class="tooltip" data-text="[ch. 中央] 1. The Central Committee of the CCP. 2. The Central Government of China. 3. Sometimes it also conveys &quot;China.&quot;">zhongyang</span> and have the <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. ཁམས་པ] A person from the Kham region, a Tibetan from the Khampa (Khamba) sub-cultural group.">Khampa</span>'s disturbance ceased" [Tib. ཁམས་པའི་ཟིང་ཆ་འཇགས་ཐབས་དང་ཀྲུང་དབྱང་དགོངས་པ་དྭངས་ཐབས]. He went taking all of his money and never came back to Tibet, they all fled to India and didn't come back. At that time, he held up his thumb and said at that meeting, "please don't do it. It is not worthy of doing it [Tib. བྱེད་རིན་མི་འདུག]. I am a layman with wife and a father of children, but you people are single. We have a thought for the future, but now it is not worthy of working. So try to get along well."   

**Q:**  Were there both the <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. དཔེ་ཆ་བ] A monk studying the monastic philosophical curriculum. A scholar monk.">pechawa</span> and the <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. བླ་རྒྱུད་པ] A term for the common monks in a monastery (in contrast to the scholar monks who were actively studying the Buddhist doctrine).">lagyüba</span>?   

**A:**  There were many <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. དཔེ་ཆ་བ] A monk studying the monastic philosophical curriculum. A scholar monk.">pechawa</span>, so they were afraid and they probably were meeting in some corners. This meeting in <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. རྣམ་གསལ་གླིང] The family name of a well-known aristocratic lay official.">Namseling</span> were all <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. བླ་རྒྱུད་པ] A term for the common monks in a monastery (in contrast to the scholar monks who were actively studying the Buddhist doctrine).">lagyüba</span> and the pechawa were not there, but they delivered the messages to them.   

**Q:**  How many <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. བླ་རྒྱུད་པ] A term for the common monks in a monastery (in contrast to the scholar monks who were actively studying the Buddhist doctrine).">lagyüba</span> were there?   

**A:**  There were about 10 <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. བླ་རྒྱུད་པ] A term for the common monks in a monastery (in contrast to the scholar monks who were actively studying the Buddhist doctrine).">lagyüba</span>. The head [Tib. ཨོམ་ཏོར] of the lagyüba was Wöser Chökyong [Tib. འོད་ཟེར་ཆོས་སྐྱོང] He was short but very eloquent. He is now at Sera, he knows it all. In about 1980 he came to Drepung to ask to be readmitted. But they didn't at once agree and told him to wait awhile. So he was sad and therefore went to Sera and said I am an old monk and Drepung won't admit me so can I join Sera? They let him. There are also a few Sera monks in Drepung. In Drepung, there is a monk from Chamdo and a monk from the Shang Ganen Chönkhor [Tib. ཤངས་དགའ་ལྡན་ཆོས་འཁོར], and a monk from the Dagpo Ngari [Tib. dwags po mnga' ris Tratsang who are not the monks of Drepung.

He was the head of the monk official segment, the Dalai Lama&#x27;s household and the Dalai Lama&#x27;s private storeroom [tib. dzübug].">Jigyab khembo</span>, right?   

**A:**  Yes.

**A:**  Yes.   

**Q:**  Is he still alive?   

**A:**  I heard that he is still alive. I am not sure he is a monk or not. He was the <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. རྩེ་དྲུང] A monk official in the Tibetan government.">tsidrung</span> of the Jigyab Khenpo Shagtsang and was related to him and there was one who did the west <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. གཉེར་ཚང] 1.
