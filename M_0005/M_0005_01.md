**Q:**  How old were you when you first became a monk?   

**A:**  I first became a monk at the age of 9 in 1927.   

**Q:**  Where are you from?   

**A:**  I'm from Pemba Dzong [Tib. དཔལ་འབར] in Chamdo [Tib. ཆབ་མདོ].   

**Q:**  Did you come as a <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. གྲྭ་རྒྱུན] Monks who came to Drepung, Ganden and Sera from far distances such as Kham and Amdo.">tragyün</span>?   

**A:**  Yes. I joined in <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. སྒོ་མང] One of the large colleges in Drepung Monastery.">Gomang</span> Tratsang Gungru [Tib. གུང་རུ] Khamtsen.   

**Q:**  Which <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. མི་ཚན] A sub-unit of a khamtsen.">mitsen</span>?   

**A:**  There is no mitsen.   

**Q:**  Did you first become a monk in the monastery in your homeland?   

**A:**  Yes. We call that monastery <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. གཞིས་དགོན] A branch monastery.">shigön</span> [Tib.གཞིས་དགོན]. I stayed as a monk there for 3 three years, then I came to Lhasa.   

**Q:**  Can you tell us about how you came to Tibet? Did you come with some partners?   

**A:**  I came with 2 partners at the age of 12 in (1930). At that time, there was no vehicle. We came on foot carrying a backpack [Tib. རྒྱུག་ཁུག]. We carried mainly <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. རྩམ་པ] The traditional Tibetan staple food that consists of grain that is roasted (popped), usually in heated sand, and then ground into a flour.">tsamba</span>, bedding, cushion and monk's clothes. We came via the main road and crossed the mountain pass called Shargongla [Tib. ཤར་གོང་ལ]. There were lots of people at that time going up and down on that road like traders, etc. We carried our own food and things so wherever we ended up at night we stayed. We put three rocks into a fireplace and made tea and ate tsamba. We would get up in the morning before dawn and leave. At about 10 a.m, we would stop at a place that had firewood and make fire and tea. That's how we came-it took us 21 days like this from Pemba Dzong to Lhasa.   

**Q:**  Was it located between Chamdo and Lhodzong [Tib. ལྷོ་རྫོང].   

**A:**  Lho<span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. རྫོང] A district in the traditional Tibetan governmental structure. This large administrative unit was headed by one or two district heads (tib. dzongpön [རྫོང་དཔོན]) appointed by the Tibetan government. Typically there was one lay official and one monk official who were jointly sent from Lhasa for three year terms. They were responsible for collecting taxes and adjudicating disputes in their district. These dzong were equivalent to counties (ch. 县) in the current Chinese system of administration.">dzong</span> is located below Pemba Dzong. When we came up we reach Shopado [Tib. ཤོ་པ་མདོ] which is a dzong and then we reach Pemba, where there is a monastery.   

**Q:**  How old are you now?   

**A:**  I am now 73.   

**Q:**  When you came to Lhasa was the Regent Reting?   

**A:**  I think he had just started.   

**Q:**  Is it true that if the <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. གྲྭ་རྒྱུན] Monks who came to Drepung, Ganden and Sera from far distances such as Kham and Amdo.">tragyün</span> come to the three great monastic seats and when they return to the <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. གཞིས་དགོན] A branch monastery.">shigön</span> they have a higher title?   

**A:**  Tragyün who come and study <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. མཚན་ཉིད] Buddhist dialectics. This is taught after the six-year curriculum called düdra.">tsenyi</span> and pass the <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. དགེ་ཤེས] An advanced degree earned by scholar monks.">geshe</span> exam, or even if they didn't pass geshe but are good in tshenyi, then when they return to <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. གཞིས་དགོན] A branch monastery.">shigön</span>, they would not get any title and there is no extra alms or salary. But they would put them at the head of the row [Tib. གྲལ་འགོ] and would have a higher esteem [Tib. མཐོང་ཆེན་པོ] and be regarded as precious or holy [Tib. རྩ་བ་ཆེན་པོ]. But for those like us who haven't study much tsenyi, we won't be considered as esteemed as the geshe, but will be regarded as more holy in terms religious faith than those monks who stayed there.   

**Q:**  Is there a custom as in Treu [Tib. ཏྲེ་ཧོར] <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. ཁམས་པ] A person from the Kham region, a Tibetan from the Khamba (Khampa) sub-cultural group.">Khamba</span> of coming for 3 years and then leaving?   

**A:**  The Treu <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. ཁམས་པ] A person from the Kham region, a Tibetan from the Khamba (Khampa) sub-cultural group.">Khamba</span> come for 3 years and then return and the monastery in Treu sends three replacements. We have no custom such as this. We can stay as long as possible.   

**Q:**  How many monks were there in your <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. གཞིས་དགོན] A branch monastery.">shigön</span>?   

**A:**  It is called Jara Pemba [Tib. ལྕགས་ར་དཔལ་འབར]. It had 2 <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. གྲྭ་ཚང] A &quot;college&quot; within a monastery, for example, in Drepung Monastery there were four main tratsang: Gomang, Loseling, Deyang and Ngagpa. These tratsang were property owning corporate entities and included monks who were organized into residential dormitories called Khamtsen.">tratsang</span> and little more than 200 monks.   

**Q:**  Trindor: It fought a lot against the Chinese, right?   

**A:**  Yes.   

**Q:**  When they did they fight?   

**Q:**  Trindor: They fought in 1960-61, right?   

**A:**  Yes. In 1959, it was finished in one morning and when they were implementing the reforms in Lhasa and they were studying and arresting and killing people, in our homeland, they were fighting and at that time, the lama was there and a plane came from Taiwan and dropped guns and the bombs.   

**Q:**  Trindor: The plane was from Tailand and it was American plane.   

**Q:**  MCG. It might be our plane which was sent from Taiwan because we had a strong relation with them and was opposing the communists.   

**A:**  Yes, the plane came from Taiwan and in the beginning, they made severe war here where there were high mountains.   

**Q:**  At that time, where were you? You were here [Lhasa] or there?   

**A:**  I was here. I never returned to the <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. གཞིས་དགོན] A branch monastery.">shigön</span>. I lived in <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. སྒོ་མང] One of the large colleges in Drepung Monastery.">Gomang</span> since I came at age 12. My shigön was old it was built by Drogön Chögye Phagpa [Tib.འགྲོ་མགོན་ཆོས་རྒལ་འཕགས་པ] who was also called Phamo Drupa [Tib. ཕག་མོ་གྲུ་པ] who became the president [Tib. སྲིད་འཛིན] of Tibet. [Sakya [Tib. ས་སྐྱ] lama] It was before Tsongkhapa came.   

**Q:**  Did your <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. གཞིས་དགོན] A branch monastery.">shigön</span> have alms and salary like Drepung on which the monks live on or their household supplys them?   

**A:**  It had a little bit grain salary but there was no alms and salary like Drepung because it was located in the countryside. We didn't use Tibetan currency much. For example, I had never seen the 100 <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. སྲང] A unit of traditional Tibetan currency. It was also called ngüsang [tib. དངུལ་སྲང]. 50 nügsang = 1 dotse; 10 sho = 1 nügsang; 20 5-karma coins = 1 ngüsang. There were also paper currency notes of 7-sang, 25-sang, and 10-sang denominations.">sang</span> note, gyalor [Tib. བརྒྱ་ལོར]. I saw a little bit the note of 7 sang and the 5 sho.   

**Q:**  How do you use money?   

**A:**  We wouldn't use much money and do trade. Money was very rare. We would try to find musk and pilose antler of the young stag [Tib. ཁྲག་རྭ]. We would exchange these for tea. And we would also barter our grain for meat and butter. And people would weave their own woolen cloth, <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. སྣམ་བུ] Hand-woven woolen fabric/material.">nambu</span> [Tib. སྣམ་བུ] and make clothes out of it. We didn't use money for buying things much. And when trader came through from <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. དར་རྩེ་མདོ ] The prefectural seat of Ganzi Prefecture in Sichuan. Also known as Kangding and Tachienlu.">Dartsedo</span> [Tib. དར་རྩེ་མདོ], we would barter copper pots and ladles with grain which they would use for fodder for their pack animals.   

**Q:**  How would you manage yoyr <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. རྩམ་པ] The traditional Tibetan staple food that consists of grain that is roasted (popped), usually in sand, and then ground into a flour.">tsampa</span> and those stuffs?   

**A:**  In the <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. གཞིས་དགོན] A branch monastery.">shigön</span>, the monastery gave us about 4 <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. ཁལ] A traditional volume measurement used for measuring grain in traditional Tibetan society. Sizes of this unit varied somewhat, but the official government khe (called mkhar ru or bstan dzin mkha ru) weighed about 28-31 pounds for barley. It was used to convey the size of fields. For example, a field said to be 10 khe in size meant that 10 khe of seed could be sown on that field.">khe</span> of grain a year. So most of my other needs in grain etc were given to me by my family. They would make it into <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. རྩམ་པ] The traditional Tibetan staple food that consists of grain that is roasted (popped), usually in heated sand, and then ground into a flour.">tsamba</span> and bring it to me. The monastery hold quite a lot of <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. ཚོགས] 1. A prayer assembly meeting in monasteries when all the monks come to an assembly hall and chant prayers together. 2. An offering made of tsamba, butter and dry cheese in the shape of a cone.">tsog</span> like for 7 days as it had good endowments. Sometimes there would be a <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. ཚོག] 1. An offering made of tsamba, butter and dry cheese in the shape of a cone. 2. A prayer assembly meeting in monasteries when all the monks come to an assembly hall and chant prayers together.">tshog</span> for one whole week.   

**Q:**  How did you decide to come to Lhasa?   

**A:**  I had a great desire to go to Lhasa and my friend asked me if I wanted to go to Lhasa with him. I said "yes but I'm not ready to go immediately". The friend said "I am making <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. རྩམ་པ] The traditional Tibetan staple food that consists of grain that is roasted (popped), usually in heated sand, and then ground into a flour.">tsamba</span> preparations." I said, "I will think about it". We didn't need fancy traveling clothes, a chuba from white woolen <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. སྣམ་བུ] Hand-woven woolen fabric/material.">nambu</span> was fine. I heard that in Lhasa you need two pairs of boots with good soles and I also heard that you need a good backpack frame. I wore one boots and put the other in my pack. In the evening the boots served as a pillow. But I had to get some tsamba. This area was abundant in tsamba as it was a farm area.   

**Q:**  Did you have to ask your <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. དགེ་རྒན] 1. Teacher in a school. 2. In monastic settings it also refers to an adult monk who acted as a guardian to a younger monk. In such cases, the younger monk typically lived in the gegen&#x27;s apartment (shag). In monasteries, however, it could also mean a real teacher, or the monk who served as the guarantor for a new monk.">gegen</span> and parents that you are going to Lhasa?   

**A:**  There is the custom to ask the <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. གྲྭ་ཚང] A &quot;college&quot; within a monastery, for example, in Drepung Monastery there were four main tratsang: Gomang, Loseling, Deyang and Ngagpa. These tratsang were property owning corporate entities and included monks who were organized into residential dormitories called Khamtsen.">tratsang</span> and <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. དགེ་རྒན] 1. Teacher in a school. 2. In monastic settings it also refers to an adult monk who acted as a guardian to a younger monk. In such cases, the younger monk typically lived in the gegen&#x27;s apartment (shag). In monasteries, however, it could also mean a real teacher, or the monk who served as the guarantor for a new monk.">gegen</span>, etc., but the monastery won't let monks leave easily. Normally you give the monastery a <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. ཁ་བཏགས] A Tibetan ceremonial scarf given to lamas, visitors, etc.">khata</span> and a <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. ཁལ] A traditional volume measurement used for measuring grain in traditional Tibetan society. Sizes of this unit varied somewhat, but the official government khe (called mkhar ru or bstan dzin mkha ru) weighed about 28-31 pounds for barley. It was used to convey the size of fields. For example, a field said to be 10 khe in size meant that 10 khe of seed could be sown on that field.">khe</span> of grain when asking permission but the monastery didn't let people go easily, maybe it was because they feared loosing too many monks to Lhasa, in any case it wasn't easy. [and he didn't ask anyone]. My family was situated right near the monastery. It was a poor family. But I had a relative in the monastery who was very rich. I went to him and told lie and said "I have to go some where on a trip and have no boots, so could you lend me yours and I will come back soon". He agreed. So I went to Lhasa with <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. རྩམ་པ] The traditional Tibetan staple food that consists of grain that is roasted (popped), usually in heated sand, and then ground into a flour.">tsamba</span>, boots and money of only 2 <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. སྲང] A unit of traditional Tibetan currency. It was also called ngüsang [tib. དངུལ་སྲང]. 50 nügsang = 1 dotse; 10 sho = 1 nügsang; 20 5-karma coins = 1 ngüsang. There were also paper currency notes of 7-sang, 25-sang, and 10-sang denominations.">sang</span> and 4 <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. ཞོ] A unit in the traditional Tibetan currency system. 10 sho equaled to 1 sang and 10 karma equaled one sho.">sho</span>, it is equal to 12 <span class="tooltip" data-text="[ch. 分] 1/100th of a yuan; one cent.">fen</span> Chinese currency, but at that time this was a fair amount. One of my monk accompany was young like me but the other was about 40 years old. The night we were leaving I stayed at the <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. 1. ཤག, 2. ཞག] 1. The apartment/room of a monk. 2. The butter fat that coagulates on the top of butter-tea when the tea is left to sit for some time. If the tea had been made with a lot of butter, this layer could be thick enough to scoop off and save to later sell or eat separately. The senior monks are usually served tea with a lot of shag.">shag</span> of my accompany and we drank tea and ate pag. It was a very big and heavy load of <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. རྩམ་པ] The traditional Tibetan staple food that consists of grain that is roasted (popped), usually in sand, and then ground into a flour.">tsampa</span> to carry. Then we changed from monk's robe to layman clothes and left at about midnight. We wore our hats to cover our faces as much as possible and left. We did three prostrations towards the monastery and said some prayers as we left the monastery through the road below the circumambulation road and then we were on our way and stayed overnight to the stations. Our tsamba lasted for about 17 days and then it was exhausted. Then we had to beg for food the rest of the days. It took us longer, but it was okay. Then we arrived in Lhasa at the Lhedong Shenkha [Tib. ལྷ་གདོང་ཤན་ཁ] ferry site. The ferryman said the fare to take us across was 1 sho. But we didn't pay. We told the ferryman we didn't have money, and he said wait at the dock awhile. Then a trader with about 20 or so horses and mule loads came and he paid our fare. The trader said to the ferryman these are monks, so you should send them across. [The ferryman must have been reluctant because then] the trader said I'll pay their fare. Then we were in Lhasa and were very happy. We went straight to Drepung where we had our khamtsen.   

**Q:**  Did you go to Drepung directly or stayed in Lhasa for awhile?   

**A:**  We could have stayed awhile in Lhasa if we knew someone, but we didn't and we spoke <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. ཁམས་པ] A person from the Kham region, a Tibetan from the Khamba (Khampa) sub-cultural group.">Khamba</span>'s dialect which local people found hard to understand. But even if we new someone's name it would have been hard to find them, especially given our dialect. So we went to Drepung directly to find our <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. ཁང་ཚན] A monastic residential unit in which monks from specific geographic areas lived. These were corporate entities with property and internal officials. Some large khamtsen had smaller subordinate units called mi tshan. Khamtsen were part of tratsang (colleges). For example, Hamdong Khamtsen was part of Gomang College in Drepung Monastery.">khamtsen</span> and asked where is Gungru Khamtsen. Whether you are from the <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. ཨ་མདོ] One of the three main Tibetan sub-ethnic areas. It is located in the northeast of the Tibetan Plateau mostly in today&#x27;s Qinghai Province. A person from Amdo is called an Amdowa.">Amdo</span> region of eastern Tibet Dotö [Tib. མདོ་སྟོད] or Kham region eastern Tibet the Domey [Tib. མདོ་སྟོད], once you reach your khamtsen where you belonged to, there are always people from your land.   

**Q:**  When you get there, you look for the <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. ཁང་ཚན་དགེ་རྒན] The head official of a khamtsen.">khamtsen gegen</span> who will ask where are you from?   

**A:**  We will say we are from Pemba Dzong and have come to become monks. And then he would send his <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. དགེ་ཕྲུག] 1. Student. 2. Disciple. 3. Commonly the name for monks living with a gegen or teacher. These are more like wards than real disciples.">gidru</span> to different monks who will provide <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. 1. ཤག, 2. ཞག] 1. The apartment/room of a monk. 2. The butter fat that coagulates on the top of butter-tea when the tea is left to sit for some time. If the tea had been made with a lot of butter, this layer could be thick enough to scoop off and save to later sell or eat separately. The senior monks are usually served tea with a lot of shag.">shag</span> for a few days. The next day we are taken to the abbot by the <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. ཁང་ཚན་དགེ་རྒན] The head official of a khamtsen.">khamtsen gegen</span> to do first audience [Tib. གསར་མཇལ] At this time we give a <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. ཁ་བཏགས] A Tibetan ceremonial scarf given to lamas, visitors, etc.">khata</span> and do prostration. And the abbot would ask us what is your name?" and are you a <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. དགེ་སློང] A monk who has taken the full set of vows.">gelong</span> or <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. དགེ་ཚུལ] 1. The novice vows that Buddhist monks and nuns take. 2. A monk who has taken such vows.">getsül</span>? He will make a list of these. After all of these are done then you can go to <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. ཚོགས] 1. A prayer assembly meeting in monasteries when all the monks come to an assembly hall and chant prayers together. 2. An offering made of tsamba, butter and dry cheese in the shape of a cone.">tsog</span> and collect gye/phog. After 2-3 days you would be registered as a monk. The khamtsen gegen would try to arrange for someone from our homeland to be our gegen.   

**Q:**  Is this <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. དགེ་རྒན] 1. Teacher in a school. 2. In monastic settings it also refers to an adult monk who acted as a guardian to a younger monk. In such cases, the younger monk typically lived in the gegen&#x27;s apartment (shag). In monasteries, however, it could also mean a real teacher, or the monk who served as the guarantor for a new monk.">gegen</span> your food giving gegen, toter gegen [Tib. ལྟོ་སྟེར་དགེ་རྒན]?   

**A:**  No. He isn't responsible for providing us food. Usually we don't have relatives to join their <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. 1. ཤག, 2. ཞག] 1. The apartment/room of a monk. 2. The butter fat that coagulates on the top of butter-tea when the tea is left to sit for some time. If the tea had been made with a lot of butter, this layer could be thick enough to scoop off and save to later sell or eat separately. The senior monks are usually served tea with a lot of shag.">shag</span>, so we are given a <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. དགེ་རྒན] 1. Teacher in a school. 2. In monastic settings it also refers to an adult monk who acted as a guardian to a younger monk. In such cases, the younger monk typically lived in the gegen&#x27;s apartment (shag). In monasteries, however, it could also mean a real teacher, or the monk who served as the guarantor for a new monk.">gegen</span> or find one from the monks who were from same land. Then the gegen and <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. དགེ་ཕྲུག] 1. Student. 2. Disciple. 3. Commonly the name for monks living with a gegen or teacher. These are more like wards than real disciples.">gidru</span> both put their seals and after having the meeting with abbot we are monks. We go to get gye/phog from the <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. ཚོགས་ཆེན] The main assembly hall of a monastery. The assembly hall for the monastery as a whole.">tshogchen</span>, <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. གྲྭ་ཚང] A &quot;college&quot; within a monastery, for example, in Drepung Monastery there were four main tratsang: Gomang, Loseling, Deyang and Ngagpa. These tratsang were property owning corporate entities and included monks who were organized into residential dormitories called Khamtsen.">tratsang</span> and khamtsen. Each of us <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. གྲྭ་རྒྱུན] Monks who came to Drepung, Ganden and Sera from far distances such as Kham and Amdo.">tragyün</span> are responsible for our own livelihood. Then it is up to us whether we will study <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. དཔེ་ཆ] Religious books/texts, scriptures.">pecha</span> or memmorize the prayers recited in the tsog. No one tells us what to do. We live on the alms/ salary. There is no one who helps us with food or money. The monastery can't help since there are so many monks. The saying is that there are 7700 monks but at the ceremony of Dalai Lama's ordination [Tib.ཆོས་ཞུགས] there were over 10,000 in Drepung [collecting gye]. At that time, the <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. སྡེ་བ་གཞུང] The name of the traditional Tibetan government.">dewashung</span> was estimating that probably there would not be 10,000 monks in Drepung. And then in Sera, they found there was even more than Drepung, so they were suspucious and thinking that how could there be more than Drepung. There were so many monks, therefore, they couldn't manage their livelihood. So because of one's own karmic result, we lived poorly [at first]. Sometimes we drank water and sometimes black tea. We only ate as little <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. རྩམ་པ] The traditional Tibetan staple food that consists of grain that is roasted (popped), usually in heated sand, and then ground into a flour.">tsamba</span> as possible. So it was hard at first. There were many monks who were really making their living according to religion and studying pecha. The majority of those came from long distance. But all the 1st, 2nd and 3rd places of Lharamba <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. དགེ་ཤེས] An advanced degree earned by scholar monks.">geshe</span> and the tsogramba were all from the long distance like Mongolian and Dotö is khamba and Domey is Amdo.   

**Q:**  Were you regarded as long distance?   

**A:**  We were considered Dotö and we were called long distance.   

**Q:**  Was there any custom giving <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. དགེ་ཕྲུག] 1. Student. 2. Disciple. 3. Commonly the name for monks living with a gegen or teacher. These are more like wards than real disciples.">gidru</span> to a <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. དགེ་རྒན] 1. Teacher in a school. 2.

**Q:**  Do these monks stay in the same <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. 1. ཤག, 2. ཞག] 1. The apartment/room of a monk. 2. The butter fat that coagulates on the top of butter-tea when the tea is left to sit for some time.

**A:**  No. They live separately. The <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. 1. ཤག, 2. ཞག] 1. The apartment/room of a monk. 2. The butter fat that coagulates on the top of butter-tea when the tea is left to sit for some time.

If there were 4 of us from kham and asked to live together, they would put all four in a shag, or if we wanted two to live together, they would put two in a shag, but the shag were bad ones. Some <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. ཁང་ཚན] A monastic residential unit in which monks from specific geographic areas lived. These were corporate entities with property and internal officials. Some large khamtsen had smaller subordinate units called mi tshan. Khamtsen were part of tratsang (colleges). For example, Hamdong Khamtsen was part of Gomang College in Drepung Monastery.">khamtsen</span> had plentiful of shag, but not many monks and others were scarce of shag. Our khamtsen had about 600 monks. It was one of the 4 bigger ones, khamtsen chekha [Tib. ཆེ་ཁག] like Samlo [Tib. བསམ་ལྷོ] Hamdong [Tib. ཧར་གདོང], Gungru [Tib. གུང་རུ] and Bati [Tib. པྲ་ཏི]. There are the ones from which the <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. གྲྭ་ཚང] A &quot;college&quot; within a monastery, for example, in Drepung Monastery there were four main tratsang: Gomang, Loseling, Deyang and Ngagpa. These tratsang were property owning corporate entities and included monks who were organized into residential dormitories called Khamtsen.">tratsang</span> chabu come. There are many lamas also in Gungru. Kündeling Tatsha [Tib. ཀུན་བདེ་གླིང་རྟ་ཚགས] Rimpoche belongs to Gungru. We are medium for the number of <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. དཔེ་ཆ་བ] A monk studying the monastic philosophical curriculum. A scholar monk.">pechawa</span> In the past Gungru had provided many abbots and scholars and <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. དགའ་ལྡན་ཁྲི་པ] The chief abbot of Ganden Monastery. He is considered to hold the throne of Tsongkapa, the founder of the Gelugpa sect.">Ganden Tripa</span>, but later it became less which was really the fluctuation of the Buddism [Tib. བསྟན་པ་ཕར་ཆག] and finally, it became the like <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. དགེ་ཤེས] An advanced degree earned by scholar monks.">geshe</span> and the scholars were exhausted. In the past, before the document of Gungru Chöngjung, [Tib. གུང་རུ་ཆོས་འབྱུང] witten by the famous lama. There is meditation cave of this lama where he stayed in a poor condition and this was the old document and there were few of these documents left. Later, Jayang Sheba Ngawang Tsöndrü [Tib. འཇམ་དབྱངས་བཞད་པ་ངག་དབང་བརྩོན་འགྲུས] wrote the new document.   

**Q:**  Who paid for your monks' robes?   

**A:**  We, ourselves have to pay for it. We carried used robes from homeland because we heard this was the best way to do it. But we had to make new boots because <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. སྒོ་མང] One of the large colleges in Drepung Monastery.">Gomang</span> only allows the kind of boots called shasuma [Tib. ཤ་གཟུགས་མ] and we were not allowed to wear this kind of boots. So for the first few years life is very hard for the tragyün. There was a saying in our land about Tibet the everything is expensive. Like eating gold and drinking silver [Tib. གསེར་ཟ་དངུལ་འཐུང] This is because you have to pay for everything except water.   

**Q:**  When you came to Drepung could you read?   

**A:**  Yes I could read. In my own land I had already took some <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. དཔེ་ཆ] Religious books/texts, scriptures.">pecha</span> test.   

**Q:**  In what grade did you study?   

**A:**  In my homeland, we didn't have special kind of grade, but here it is like the grade just after the khatog garmar. But I could read <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. དཔེ་ཆ] Religious books/texts, scriptures.">pecha</span> pretty well. This is because the way we studied pecha in my monastery was different from the way in [central] Tibet. We had to read a long and thick book of hand writing form, <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. དབུ་མེད] The style of &quot;headless&quot; Tibetan writing that is intermediate between printed style and cursive.">umey</span> [Tib. དབུ་མེད]. We had to read this everyday and finish it. And I heard that some were made to read three or five times. So when I came to Drepung I could read well. After I came to Drepung I stayed as a carefree <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. ལྡབ་ལྡོབ] A mildly deviant type of fighting or &quot;punk&quot; monk who engaged in fighting and other unusual behaviors for monks in traditional Tibet&#x27;s large monasteries.">dobdo</span> and just passed my time. I was a dobdo for 9 years.   

**Q:**  Were you in the jumping <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. ལྟོ་ཚང] 1. The club of the Dobdos. 2. A group of people eating together.">tobtsang</span>?   

**A:**  No. I didn't do jumping but I went to watch and gave some donations for them to buy tea and butter. I wasn't able to practice much dharma. But I also didn't do any bad acts. I stayed as a <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. ལྡབ་ལྡོབ] A mildly deviant type of fighting or &quot;punk&quot; monk who engaged in fighting and other unusual behaviors for monks in traditional Tibet&#x27;s large monasteries.">dobdo</span> being carefree and passing my time [Tib. ཉི་མ་གང་འཁྱོལ].   

**Q:**  Did you study <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. མཚན་ཉིད] Buddhist dialectics. This is taught after the six-year curriculum called düdra.">tsenyi</span>?   

**A:**  No. But I studied a little bit prayers recited in the <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. ཚོགས] 1. A prayer assembly meeting in monasteries when all the monks come to an assembly hall and chant prayers together. 2. An offering made of tsamba, butter and dry cheese in the shape of a cone.">tsog</span> [Tib. འདོན་ཁ་ཁྲལ]. Then I joined the monks called gonpog [Tib. མགོན་པོ་བ] in the <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. གྲྭ་ཚང] A &quot;college&quot; within a monastery, for example, in Drepung Monastery there were four main tratsang: Gomang, Loseling, Deyang and Ngagpa. These tratsang were property owning corporate entities and included monks who were organized into residential dormitories called Khamtsen.">tratsang</span> who dose prayers for propretiating the protective deities like Maha Kala [Tib. མགོན་པོ] and the Deity of Wealth, Namse [Tib. རྣམ་སྲས] etc. Each deity has different prayers. And I got the training in making the <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. གཏོར་མ] A ritual offering made from tsamba and water.">torma</span> offerings etc. And in the <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. མགོན་ཁང] A chapel devoted to a protector deity.">gönkhang</span> there is a senior monk. I was the <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. དགེ་ཕྲུག] 1. Student. 2. Disciple. 3. Commonly the name for monks living with a gegen or teacher. These are more like wards than real disciples.">gidru</span> of him and I was the umdze. I did this for quite awhile and came to know the rituals well. Then I went to north to do the büdü [Tib. འབུལ་སྡུད] for giving initiation, doing divinations, performing rituals and doing things for the deceaced and collecting offerings and donations for the khamtsen. I did this for 4 years.   

**Q:**  Where did you go in the north?   

**A:**  I went to Sangshung [Tib. གསང་གཞུང] located just before we reach Nagchu. I was not a <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. དགེ་ཤེས] An advanced degree earned by scholar monks.">geshe</span>, but I had this yellow vest to wear because when we were in the protective deitys chapel, <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. མགོན་ཁང] A chapel devoted to a protector deity.">gönkhang</span> [Tib. མགོན་ཁང] we could wear this yellow vest which is the rule of the <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. རྒྱུད་སྨད] The Lower Tantric Monastic College in Lhasa.">Gyüme</span> and all the rituals were also done according to the Gyüme tradition. Even if the geshe didn't join the Gyüme, they would not wear the yellow vest.   

**Q:**  In the <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. ཁང་ཚན] A monastic residential unit in which monks from specific geographic areas lived. These were corporate entities with property and internal officials. Some large khamtsen had smaller subordinate units called mi tshan. Khamtsen were part of tratsang (colleges). For example, Hamdong Khamtsen was part of Gomang College in Drepung Monastery.">khamtsen</span>, what kind of monk's obligation called shamthotre [Tib. ཤམ་ཐབས་ཁྲལ] did you have to do?   

**A:**  I didn't have to do that because I went to the north. I would have had to do khamsten <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. དགེ་རྒན] 1. Teacher in a school. 2. In monastic settings it also refers to an adult monk who acted as a guardian to a younger monk. In such cases, the younger monk typically lived in the gegen&#x27;s apartment (shag). In monasteries, however, it could also mean a real teacher, or the monk who served as the guarantor for a new monk.">gegen</span>, but since we have many monks in the <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. ཁང་ཚན] A monastic residential unit in which monks from specific geographic areas lived. These were corporate entities with property and internal officials. Some large khamtsen had smaller subordinate units called mi tshan. Khamtsen were part of tratsang (colleges). For example, Hamdong Khamtsen was part of Gomang College in Drepung Monastery.">khamtsen</span>, so I didn't reach the turn for doing khamtsen gegen. After the revolt I was classified as <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. གྲལ་རིམ; ch. 阶级] 1. A social class. 2. A class enemy.">trerim</span> because I went as büdü. I thought it was unfair to classify me as a trerim because of this. But later I thought it was okay and I stayed quiet as a trerim. I didn't have anything real bad happened to me. That was fortunate. If I had become an poor class [Tib. དབུལ་པོངས] and if I had become an activist, I would have received some free things, but it would have shortened my life and these things would not last long. By staying as trerim, I didn't harm anyone else and didn't take other people's property, so that was good.   

**Q:**  Usually, what work do you have to do in Gungru Khamtsen?   

**A:**  The first job is that you have to do 1 year as <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. ཁང་ཚན་དགེ་རྒན] The head official of a khamtsen.">khamtsen gegen</span> who is the master of laws and rules [Tib. ཁྲིམས་ཀྱི་བདག་པོ].   

**Q:**  Is this one person?   

**A:**  Yes. After that, you have to do <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. གཉེར་པ] A steward or manager. In some monasteries, the nyerpa was in charge of storerooms under the authority of a higher manager called a chandzö.">nyerpa</span> in <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. ཁང་ཚན] A monastic residential unit in which monks from specific geographic areas lived. These were corporate entities with property and internal officials. Some large khamtsen had smaller subordinate units called mi tshan. Khamtsen were part of tratsang (colleges).

Then there is a gap of some years and if your name comes up you have to be the loan collector, drudeyba [Tib. འབྲུ་འདེད་པ] for 3 years.   

**Q:**  When would you come to the <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. ཚོགས་འདུ] 1. The general name for the various types of Tibetan government assemblies. 2. Any assembly, e.g., the assembly (meeting) of monks in a college.">tsondu</span>?   

**A:**  You are in the <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. ཚོགས་འདུ] 1. The general name for the various types of Tibetan government assemblies. 2. Any assembly, e.g., the assembly (meeting) of monks in a college.">tsondu</span> as soon as you finish the <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. ཁང་ཚན] A monastic residential unit in which monks from specific geographic areas lived. These were corporate entities with property and internal officials. Some large khamtsen had smaller subordinate units called mi tshan. Khamtsen were part of tratsang (colleges). For example, Hamdong Khamtsen was part of Gomang College in Drepung Monastery.">khamtsen</span> gegen. Whoever is not allowed to go to the tsondu unless you finished the khamtsen gegen. Every 4 years, there is the selection of <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. གྲྭ་ཚང] A &quot;college&quot; within a monastery, for example, in Drepung Monastery there were four main tratsang: Gomang, Loseling, Deyang and Ngagpa. These tratsang were property owning corporate entities and included monks who were organized into residential dormitories called Khamtsen.">tratsang</span> <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. ཕྱག་སྦུག] A manager (of estates and endowments) of a monastic college or monastic khamtsen.">chabu</span>. In the past, this was done mainly by wealth and backdoor. Later, when there was more and more controversy [Tib. ལབ་རྒྱུ་གླེང་རྒྱུ] it changed and a new system was instituted whereby the tsondu would come up with a list of candidates and these would be taken to Tenma Deity [Tib. བསྟན་མ] for selection (while in trance). She will put her seal on two names. These two names are given to the tratsang and there is no back door. It takes the two names and puts them into balls of dough (measured to be equal) and then does the <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. ཟན་རིལ] A divine lottery. Multiple answers to a question were written on paper of the same size and rolled in dough balls of the same size and weight. These were shaken in a plate or bowl in front of a statue of a deity until one of the balls popped out. The ball that popped out was considered to have been selected by the deity before which the lottery was done.">senriy</span> before the statue of Maha Kala. One ball of dough would fall out. This is taken to the tratsang's chabu office, chabukhang [Tib. ཆ་བུ་ཁང]. There it is opened and read who is selected. The chabu's clerk will then write a note saying so and so has been selected as the senior, dreba [Tib. བགྲེས་པ] and put a seal on it. Then the khamtsen is told to send the two candidates to the chabukhang. There the clerk says so and so has been selected as Drepa [chabu], so please give this letter to the khamtsen. To be chabu, the term is 4 years and takes some expenses but there is also income. The income and the expense would barely get balanced and they didn't have much to embezzle [Tib. ཟ].   

**Q:**  When did the new system begin?   

**A:**  It began before the Chinese entered Tibet.   

**Q:**  Was it before the <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. སྒོ་མང] One of the large colleges in Drepung Monastery.">Gomang</span> trouble?   

**A:**  It was long before the trouble. Maybe in 1946, the <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. ཁང་ཚན] A monastic residential unit in which monks from specific geographic areas lived. These were corporate entities with property and internal officials. Some large khamtsen had smaller subordinate units called mi tshan. Khamtsen were part of tratsang (colleges). For example, Hamdong Khamtsen was part of Gomang College in Drepung Monastery.">khamtsen</span> set up the new rule.   

**Q:**  It was just before the Sera War, right?   

**A:**  Yes. In 1949 there was an additional Mönlam Festival, Mönlam pharma [Tib. འཕར་མ] on the 13th, 14th and 15th day of the 6th lunar month. At this time, Jiang Kaishek controlled Beijing. He sent money to Tibet requesting to do something through religion to repulse [Tib. ཟློག་པ] the communist. So an additionnal Mönlam was held. [Trindor: [not in the tape] thinks they had lots of figures of Chinese that were burned in this Mönlam].   

**A:**  The new rule was made before this Mönlam pharma. Just before that, the Sera War took place and I was at <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. ཚོགས་མཆོད] The large religious prayer festival held in Lhasa in the 2nd Tibetan lunar month.">Tsongjö</span> Festival and we heard that on the 24th of the third lunar month all the Sera monks went back at night.   

**Q:**  Was this in the year they expelled the Chinese?   

**A:**  Yes. it was 1949 in autumn. I was in Potala at that time. I was working as a servant in Potala for making a living like working as a caretaker [Tib. སྐུ་གཉེར] and working as a servant for the <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. སྐུ་དྲག] 1. A member of the lay aristocracy. 2. Title for government lay and monk officials. 3. A name occasionally used for the top leaders/officials in a monastery.">kudrak</span> like carrying firewood. The monks were allowed to do that. I had gone from Potala to Lhasa, but at the eastern and western gates of Potala, there were soldiers posted. I went back inside and asked what is going on and they said today we are expelling the Chinese from Lhasa and they were deportd to India and they were going back through sea route. The soldiers were posted to protect <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. ནོར་བུ་གླིང་ཁ] The summer palace of the Dalai Lama.">Norbulinga</span> and Potala in case there was trouble from the Chinese. The additional Mönlam was held in the 6th month and in 8th or 9th lunar month, Jiang Kaishek fled to Taiwan. When the time came it was hard to do anything.   

**Q:**  When you were young, was your <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. དགེ་རྒན] 1. Teacher in a school. 2. In monastic settings it also refers to an adult monk who acted as a guardian to a younger monk. In such cases, the younger monk typically lived in the gegen&#x27;s apartment (shag). In monasteries, however, it could also mean a real teacher, or the monk who served as the guarantor for a new monk.">gegen</span> in Drepung a relative of yours?   

**A:**  No, he was from the same homeland.   

**Q:**  Did you stay in his <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. 1. ཤག, 2. ཞག] 1. The apartment/room of a monk. 2. The butter fat that coagulates on the top of butter-tea when the tea is left to sit for some time. If the tea had been made with a lot of butter, this layer could be thick enough to scoop off and save to later sell or eat separately. The senior monks are usually served tea with a lot of shag.">shag</span>?   

**A:**  I didn't live with him. I lived separately. I had to make and eat my own food. My <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. དགེ་རྒན] 1. Teacher in a school. 2. In monastic settings it also refers to an adult monk who acted as a guardian to a younger monk. In such cases, the younger monk typically lived in the gegen&#x27;s apartment (shag). In monasteries, however, it could also mean a real teacher, or the monk who served as the guarantor for a new monk.">gegen</span> didn't give me food.   

**Q:**  How did you generate the income?   

**A:**  I got alms like 1 <span class="tooltip" data-text="[ch. 分] 1/100th of a yuan; one cent.">fen</span> or half fen from the <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. གྲྭ་ཚང] A &quot;college&quot; within a monastery, for example, in Drepung Monastery there were four main tratsang: Gomang, Loseling, Deyang and Ngagpa. These tratsang were property owning corporate entities and included monks who were organized into residential dormitories called Khamtsen.">tratsang</span> and tsogchen. And if one was out of <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. རྩམ་པ] The traditional Tibetan staple food that consists of grain that is roasted (popped), usually in heated sand, and then ground into a flour.">tsamba</span>, other monks would give you some. If you go to some friends and say now I am out of tsamba, can you give me some,they would give it.   

**Q:**  You mean the monks in the <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. ཁང་ཚན] A monastic residential unit in which monks from specific geographic areas lived. These were corporate entities with property and internal officials. Some large khamtsen had smaller subordinate units called mi tshan. Khamtsen were part of tratsang (colleges). For example, Hamdong Khamtsen was part of Gomang College in Drepung Monastery.">khamtsen</span>?   

**A:**  Yes and I would also go to the Labrang and big shagtang to beg for <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. རྩམ་པ] The traditional Tibetan staple food that consists of grain that is roasted (popped), usually in heated sand, and then ground into a flour.">tsamba</span>, they would give me. Then also for 7 years, I went to Phembo [Tib. འཕན་པོ] for doing harvesting which was called tönyog [Tib. སྟོན་གཡོག]. I was very healthy and strong and I knew well how to do the works and this pays a good wage. You normally get 5 <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. ཁལ] A traditional volume measurement used for measuring grain in traditional Tibetan society. Sizes of this unit varied somewhat, but the official government khe (called mkhar ru or bstan dzin mkha ru) weighed about 28-31 pounds for barley. It was used to convey the size of fields. For example, a field said to be 10 khe in size meant that 10 khe of seed could be sown on that field.">khe</span> and 5 <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. བྲེ] A unit of traditional volume measurement [a container] in Tibet, 20 of which typically equaled one khe or bo [also a container], although in some areas there were only 16 dre in one khe.">dre</span> of grain for the wages and you get another 1 khe if you stay working until Ganden Ngamjö. This work starts in 24th -25th -26th of the 7th lunar month and goes on until the 16th or 17th of 9th lunar month. While we were there, there is no kind of dishes, but we could get as much tsamba and black tea as we wanted. They also give some weak <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. 1. ཆང, 2. བྱང] 1. Tibetan locally brewed barley beer. 2. North; nomad areas north of Lhasa in Nagchuga Prefecture 3. ch. 厂 factory.">chang</span> when there is hot sunshine and I also drank chang and ate pag. I was a hard worker so the villagers liked me.   

**Q:**  How did you first work as tönyog? Did the older monks tell you?   

**A:**  Other monks who have gone told me, "you are healthy and you have a hard time with your livelihood, so if you go to do this work, there is good wages and they give you good food. And the weather is good at this time".   

**Q:**  Who told you this?   

**A:**  The other older monks who have been there told me. They would go for the tönyog and grind the barley into <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. རྩམ་པ] The traditional Tibetan staple food that consists of grain that is roasted (popped), usually in heated sand, and then ground into a flour.">tsamba</span> and bring it to the monastery and eat the tsamba and save the alms. One type of monks don't do this but instead go to Lhasa to work as servant and get some wages. After I started doing this, my livelihood improved and I got to know more people.   

**Q:**  How did you make contact with the villagers in Phembo? Did you have to go to the households and ask them whether they need you to work?   

**A:**  Every year, there were monks going for the tönyog and one type of us would sell snuff and incense and matches to villagers. So the villagers would ask us, "dose any of you want to work as tönyog? We would say yes, and they would say okay then work here with my household. We would ask the wage, and they would tell us.   

**Q:**  What work did you have to do?   

**A:**  All this work was for harvesting.   

**Q:**  Did you have to do the threshing?   

**A:**  We didn't do any threshing. After bringing the grain stalks to the threshing ground, then they would pay the wages and they would grind the <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. རྩམ་པ] The traditional Tibetan staple food that consists of grain that is roasted (popped), usually in sand, and then ground into a flour.">tsampa</span> and deliver it to Lhasa and you don't need to pay the fee for that. Some household would make the monks work from before dawn to after dark, but I didn't work for such persons. There were many monks doing this in Phembo from Sera, Ganden and Drepung.   

**Q:**  Were there like 100-500 or 1,000 monks doing this?   

**A:**  In general, there were a great number of monks doing that. In Fall the <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. དགེ་རྒན] 1. Teacher in a school. 2. In monastic settings it also refers to an adult monk who acted as a guardian to a younger monk. In such cases, the younger monk typically lived in the gegen&#x27;s apartment (shag). In monasteries, however, it could also mean a real teacher, or the monk who served as the guarantor for a new monk.">gegen</span> and <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. དགེ་ཕྲུག] 1. Student. 2. Disciple. 3. Commonly the name for monks living with a gegen or teacher. These are more like wards than real disciples.">gidru</span> would go to one's home to do harvest. If the gegen is older and can't do harvesting he would help with cooking etc. If the gegen is a like <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. སྐུ་དྲག] 1. A member of the lay aristocracy. 2. Title for government lay and monk officials. 3. A name occasionally used for the top leaders/officials in a monastery.">kudrak</span> he would send his gidru home to help his family. So there were lots of monks in the villages at this time and there were also quite a lot of monks from the long distance who know harvesting well. So all total I think maybe there were 400-500 monks from Drepung going to harvest. Another 400-500 monks would go to <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. མཚོ་སྣ] A district in southern Tibet.">Tsöna</span> [Tib. མཚོ་སྣ] to get wooden bowls and greeen pepper [Tib. སོ་ལོ་སྔོན་པོ] and bring back and sell them in Lhasa though they didn't have much money to do the trade. Others would do other kind of trade while the day is long and the weather is good. When it gets cold with short days in winter, they would return to the monastery. In winter I would live from alms and salary and from the profit from summer, so my livelihood improved.   

**Q:**  Do they mostly go to Phenpo?   

**Q:**  The tönyog monks go every where like Phembo, <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. འབྲི་གུང] The Drigung Monastery.">Drigung</span>, [Tib. འབྲི་གུང] Metro Gungkar, [Tib. མལ་གྲོ་གུང་དཀར] <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. ཆུ་ཤུར] The name of a town, district and county at the confluence of the Lhasa and Tsangpo Rivers.">Chushü</span> [Tib. ཆུ་ཤུར] Tölung [Tib. སྟོད་ལུང]. Some even go as far as Lhoka if a neighbor says come to my home for the tönyog, the wages are good, so some monks go there also.   

**Q:**  When you go do the work, do you wear monks robes?   

**A:**  No. We change them in Lhasa and leave it with someone and go in laymen clothes.   

**Q:**  Then what else did you do?   

**A:**  Then I worked in Potala as a care taker for a little less than 3 years.   

**Q:**  How did you get this job?   

**A:**  I knew an monk from Hamdong who was working as cook for the late Jayangkyil jigyab khenpo] [Tib.འཇམ་དབྱང་དཀྱིལ]. When jigyab khenpo moved to Potala because he was one of the attendants [Tib. སྐུ་བཅར] [of the Dalai Lama], he went with him. At this time, the cook didn't need to carry water, but for other things like carrying firewood and other things from their house in Lhasa, he said he needs a helper. So, he said, "I need a helper who wouldn't steal". He then asked me if I would do this. There was no special wages accept some treats [Tib. རྔན་པ] and we had free food and there wasn't too much work. Mostly carrying things up and down. I stayed doing this work for a little more than one year. Then in Potala there is a temple [Tib. ལྷ་ཁང] in the <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. གྲྭ་ཚང] A &quot;college&quot; within a monastery, for example, in Drepung Monastery there were four main tratsang: Gomang, Loseling, Deyang and Ngagpa. These tratsang were property owning corporate entities and included monks who were organized into residential dormitories called Khamtsen.">tratsang</span> where each <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. ཁང་ཚན] A monastic residential unit in which monks from specific geographic areas lived. These were corporate entities with property and internal officials. Some large khamtsen had smaller subordinate units called mi tshan. Khamtsen were part of tratsang (colleges). For example, Hamdong Khamtsen was part of Gomang College in Drepung Monastery.">khamtsen</span> in turn have to send 4 monks to do the prayers for the Dalai Lama 's long life [Tib. སྐུ་ཚེ་ཚེ་སྒྲུབ]. I did this for about 1 year. So all total I stayed about 2 years in Potala.   

**Q:**  At that time, were you <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. དགེ་སློང] A monk who has taken the full set of vows.">gelong</span> or <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. དགེ་ཚུལ] 1. The novice vows that Buddhist monks and nuns take. 2. A monk who has taken such vows.">getsül</span>?   

**A:**  I was getsü. If best you should take the <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. དགེ་སློང] A monk who has taken the full set of vows.">gelong</span> vow early, but in the old society they would not take this vow early because if you take it early, then you have to do all kinds of things to earn your livelihood which will cause you to commit severe negativity [Tib. ཉེས་པ་ཆེ་རོགས]. I later took the gelong vow just before <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. སྟག་ལུང་བྲག] The regent of Tibet who replaced Reting in 1941 and served until 1950 when the 14th Dalai Lama assumed power.">Talungdra</span> left office (1950).   

**Q:**  If you did not work at all when you were young, could the monks subsist in the monastery depending on <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. འགྱེ] Alms given to monks.">gye</span> and <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. ཕོགས] 1. Salary (for a job). 2. The salary-like payments in grain, etc., that monk&#x27;s receive from their monastery.">phog</span>?   

**A:**  The monks didn't have special works, but they could do sales of incense, snuff, soaps, matches, adhesive tape commonly used on face for headache etc [Tib. ཀོ་ཡོལ], tobacco, etc to villagers and get in return <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. རྩམ་པ] The traditional Tibetan staple food that consists of grain that is roasted (popped), usually in heated sand, and then ground into a flour.">tsamba</span>. We would say like this costs 1-2 assembly bowl of tsamba. We also take money like 1-2 <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. ཞོ] A unit in the traditional Tibetan currency system. 10 sho equaled to 1 sang and 10 karma equaled one sho.">sho</span> when they didn't pay tsampa. Sometimes, there would be works like demolishing old houses and rebuilding new houses in the <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. ཁང་ཚན] A monastic residential unit in which monks from specific geographic areas lived. These were corporate entities with property and internal officials. Some large khamtsen had smaller subordinate units called mi tshan. Khamtsen were part of tratsang (colleges). For example, Hamdong Khamtsen was part of Gomang College in Drepung Monastery.">khamtsen</span> for two or three months. During this time, we would get monthly tsamba phog and the wages was also pays well.   

**Q:**  If you wanted to stay reading <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. དཔེ་ཆ] Religious books/texts, scriptures.">pecha</span> and didn't work, would the alms and the salary be enough for your living?   

**A:**  It would be very hard to live on alms/ salary. But there was one type of monk [pechawa] who lived like this. These weren't many of these though. They ate only a little <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. སྤགས] A staple Tibetan dish of tsampa mixed with tea and kneaded into balls of dough-like consistency.">pag</span> a day. After about a year of doing this, other monks would realize that the monk ate a little bit <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. རྩམ་པ] The traditional Tibetan staple food that consists of grain that is roasted (popped), usually in sand, and then ground into a flour.">tsampa</span> in the morning and didn't have tsampa to eat at midday, they would start giving him some <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. རྩམ་པ] The traditional Tibetan staple food that consists of grain that is roasted (popped), usually in heated sand, and then ground into a flour.">tsamba</span> or butter like half or one <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. རྒྱ་མ] A unit of weight equal to one jin [ch. 斤] (1.1 lbs).">gyama</span> to help. The givers would say, "look after your health. Please recieve this little amount of tsampa" If some people in Lhasa knew about this, they would give tsampa to be enough for ten some days.   

**Q:**  Most of these were <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. དཔེ་ཆ་བ] A monk studying the monastic philosophical curriculum. A scholar monk.">pechawa</span>, right?   

**A:**  Yes. They had no good clothes and no desire to wear nice clothes. They only were interested in <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. དཔེ་ཆ] Religious books/texts, scriptures.">pecha</span>. They worked very hard under difficult conditions and later if they were good in studying pecha, they would have to ask the abbot for the name of the <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. དགེ་ཤེས] An advanced degree earned by scholar monks.">geshe</span> [Tib. མིང་བཏགས] and would be picked by abbot as geshe lharamba or <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. ཚོགས་རམས་པ] A geshe who passed his exam during the Tsongjö Prayer Festival. This type of geshe title is lower than Lharamba.">tsoramba</span> [Tib. ཚོགས་རམས་པ]. After he got the geshe name, he would tell his friends, "I got geshe degree so I have to give a <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. གཏོང་སྒོ] A monastic obligation to provide the food and other necessary items served at a monastic prayer assembly meeting or some other rite; this was often a required obligation for monastic officials at the end of their term of office.">tonggo</span>, so what is best to do" There was a little bit endowment funds available from the government for this tonggo. I think it was something like 70 <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. རྡོ་ཚད] A currency unit in traditional Tibet that was equal to 50 ngüsang.">dotse</span> from the government regardless of the geshe degree. Then another 6-7 dotse from laji and maybe 4-5 dotse from the <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. གྲྭ་ཚང] A &quot;college&quot; within a monastery, for example, in Drepung Monastery there were four main tratsang: Gomang, Loseling, Deyang and Ngagpa. These tratsang were property owning corporate entities and included monks who were organized into residential dormitories called Khamtsen.">tratsang</span>. And the <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. ཁང་ཚན] A monastic residential unit in which monks from specific geographic areas lived. These were corporate entities with property and internal officials. Some large khamtsen had smaller subordinate units called mi tshan. Khamtsen were part of tratsang (colleges). For example, Hamdong Khamtsen was part of Gomang College in Drepung Monastery.">khamtsen</span> would give 1-2 dotse. But everything was expensive, so this wasn't near enough, so he would beg for some donation and he would often sell all their furniture. They only keep the clothes they were wearing, the cloak, bedding and a cushion. After they passed the geshe exam, then the geshe would join the gyüdö or gyüme. There the alms and salary were much better and the tratsang would give them the begging bowl [Tib. ལྷུང་བཟེད]. The other type of the <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. བླ་མ་རྒྱུད་པ] The name for the monks enrolled in the Upper and Lower Tantric Monastic Colleges in Lhasa (gyüme and gyütö).">lama gyüpa</span> would have to memmorize the texts for 2-3 years and then become lama gyüpa called Kyerimpa [Tib. སྐྱེད་རིམ་པ]. You could live on the grain salary and the rich families also often helped these monks. The geshe from the three great monastic seats would be automatically enrolled in gyüdö or gyüme.   

**Q:**  When you were young did you go to tsog/chöra?   

**A:**  I would go to <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. ཚོགས] 1. A prayer assembly meeting in monasteries when all the monks come to an assembly hall and chant prayers together. 2. An offering made of tsamba, butter and dry cheese in the shape of a cone.">tsog</span> all the time. If you don't go to tsog you won't get alms/ salary. I go to <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. ཆོས་ར] The special grove (&quot;dharma grove&quot;) in monasteries where monks formally met to practice debating.">chöra</span> for sometime though I didn't study <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. དཔེ་ཆ] Religious books/texts, scriptures.">pecha</span>. Then I go a lot to Lhasa to read the pecha like Sungdü [Tib. གཟུངས་བསྡུས] and Gyetong [Tib. བརྒྱད་སྟོང]. This was very good for the livelihood because it takes many days.   

**Q:**  How did you get this job ?   

**A:**  The household would hire monks to read the <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. དཔེ་ཆ] Religious books/texts, scriptures.">pecha</span>. Some one from the household tells a monk they knows in the monastery to hire some monks who can read the pecha well and that monk would ask people like me if you want to go for 15 days to read pecha. I would say yes. During this time, you get free food though you cannot keep the left over and you get quite a good wages that are not bad. So this way you can avoid using your one's own <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. རྩམ་པ] The traditional Tibetan staple food that consists of grain that is roasted (popped), usually in heated sand, and then ground into a flour.">tsamba</span> and make some side income because the place was a place where dharma is flourished. This was very helpful for my livelihood.   

**Q:**  At that time, you didn't have any worriness [Tib. སེམས་ཁྲལ] of not getting enough food, right?   

**A:**  Yes. At this time, I had no possessions and no money but also no worries or wishes for "things."   

**Q:**  Were you alone in your <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. 1. ཤག, 2. ཞག] 1. The apartment/room of a monk. 2. The butter fat that coagulates on the top of butter-tea when the tea is left to sit for some time. If the tea had been made with a lot of butter, this layer could be thick enough to scoop off and save to later sell or eat separately. The senior monks are usually served tea with a lot of shag.">shag</span>?   

**A:**  Yes.   

**Q:**  I never used to even think I wish I could buy this or that and didn't have money. I didn't even have a nice table to put my bowl on. I just had a small wooden poor quality table . If my <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. རྩམ་པ] The traditional Tibetan staple food that consists of grain that is roasted (popped), usually in heated sand, and then ground into a flour.">tsamba</span> was about to finish, I would think that I don't have enough money to <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. རྩམ་པ] The traditional Tibetan staple food that consists of grain that is roasted (popped), usually in sand, and then ground into a flour.">tsampa</span>, but otherwise I didn't worry about livelihood.   

**Q:**  How do you get money then?   

**A:**  If the <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. རྩམ་པ] The traditional Tibetan staple food that consists of grain that is roasted (popped), usually in heated sand, and then ground into a flour.">tsamba</span> was about finish, I would use some of the money I had saved from reading <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. དཔེ་ཆ] Religious books/texts, scriptures.">pecha</span> and the alms and salary and buy some. And as for butter, I would buy 1 <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. ཏམ་ཀ] A unit in the traditional Tibetan currency system that was equal to 4 sang.">tranka</span> which is equal to 1 and half <span class="tooltip" data-text="[ch. 分] 1/100th of a yuan; one cent.">fen</span> of butter at a time which is wrapped in some kind of leaf. I use this make a butter tea.   

**Q:**  Was there any grain salary or butter salary in Gungru Khamtsen?   

**A:**  No. None at all.   

**Q:**  You don't get much from <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. སྒོ་མང] One of the large colleges in Drepung Monastery.">Gomang</span> also, right?   

**A:**  Yes.   

**Q:**  How many <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. ཁལ] A traditional volume measurement used for measuring grain in traditional Tibetan society. Sizes of this unit varied somewhat, but the official government khe (called mkhar ru or bstan dzin mkha ru) weighed about 28-31 pounds for barley. It was used to convey the size of fields. For example, a field said to be 10 khe in size meant that 10 khe of seed could be sown on that field.">khe</span> of grain did <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. སྒོ་མང] One of the large colleges in Drepung Monastery.">Gomang</span> pay when you first came?

When we buy stuffs like meat and butter, we use like 1 <span class="tooltip" data-text="[ch. 分] 1/100th of a yuan; one cent.">fen</span> or 1 and half fen. But a small load of tsamba cost 7 <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. སྲང] A unit of traditional Tibetan currency. It was also called ngüsang [tib. དངུལ་སྲང]. 50 nügsang = 1 dotse; 10 sho = 1 nügsang; 20 5-karma coins = 1 ngüsang.

**Q:**  When did the <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. སྒོ་མང] One of the large colleges in Drepung Monastery.">Gomang</span> salary increase?   

**A:**  First it went from 1 to 2 <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. ཁལ] A traditional volume measurement used for measuring grain in traditional Tibetan society.

Then in 1955 or 56, we got another increase to 3 khe of grain a year. Later, there was talk of increasing one more khe but this never occurred before revolt   

**Q:**  What are the places that belonged [Tib. ཐོབ་ཁུངས] to Gungru?   

**A:**  The main ones were Shota Lhosum [Tib. ཤོ་སྟར་ལྷོ་གསུམ]; Shopado, Pemba and Lhodzong, then <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. འབྲི་གུང] The Drigung Monastery.">Drigung</span> Chetsang Rimpoche [Tib. འབྲི་གུང་ཆེ་ཚང་རིན་པོ་ཆེ] who was the son of Tsarong was also belonged to Gungru though he wouild not stay in Drepung because of his sect. Also Gojog Rimpioche [Tib.?] who died in the year before last year was also belonged to Gungru Khamtsen. Also some <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. མི་སེར] A term that can mean serf/bound subject as well as citizen, depending on context. For example, the miser of a lord would connote the bound subjects of that lord, whereas the miser of Tibet would connote citizens of Tibet.">miser</span> from Lharigo [Tib. ལྷ་རི་འགོ] were belonged to Gungru. And Kündeling's miser in Riwoche, [Tib. རི་བོ་ཆེ] and Jagsamkha [Tib. ལྕག་ཟམ་ཁ] were also Gungru. This is because Kündling is belonged to Gungru.   

**Q:**  To whom your homeland belong to?   

**A:**  We were under the government. Lhodzong and Pemba are belonged to the government. Shodado was belonegd to Kündeling and Shobado's Dzong is appointed by Kündeling. And Kündeling appoints the abbot of the monastery there from Pagshö [Tib. དཔའ་ཤོད]. Pemba Monastery's abbot was appointed by the government. Lhodzong's Siwö [Tib. gzi 'od ?] Monastery is a very big monastery which used to be under Tengyeling [Tib. བསྟན་རྒྱས་གླིང] then it was confiscated by the government so it became under government. And in Lhokha, Wön Thagpo Ngari Tratsang [Tib. འོན་དྭགས་པོ་མངའ་རིས] was also belonged to Gungru. There was a large area that belonged to Gungru and there were also many monks.   

**Q:**  Gungru was mostly <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. ཁམས་པ] A person from the Kham region, a Tibetan from the Khamba (Khampa) sub-cultural group.">Khamba</span>, but could the monks from <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. འབྲི་གུང] The Drigung Monastery.">Drigung</span> be in the <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. ཚོགས་འདུ] 1. The general name for the various types of Tibetan government assemblies. 2. Any assembly, e.g., the assembly (meeting) of monks in a college.">tsondu</span> if they come to Gungru Khamtsen?

A person from Central Tibet (tib. དབུས) or sometimes someone from political Tibet in contrast to persons from Kham and Amdo. 2. Böpa is also used nowadays as a general name for all ethnic Tibetans.">böba</span>, so they couldn't be in the <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. ཚོགས་འདུ] 1.

These were corporate entities with property and internal officials. Some large khamtsen had smaller subordinate units called mi tshan. Khamtsen were part of tratsang (colleges). For example, Hamdong Khamtsen was part of Gomang College in Drepung Monastery.">khamtsen</span> gegen. There were different ways of admission between <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. ཁམས་པ] A person from the Kham region, a Tibetan from the Khamba (Khampa) sub-cultural group.">Khamba</span> and böba in the monastery. The khampa's admission was called khamshug [Tib. ཁམས་ཞུགས] and <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. བོད་པ] 1. A person from Central Tibet (tib. དབུས) or sometimes someone from political Tibet in contrast to persons from Kham and Amdo. 2. Böpa is also used nowadays as a general name for all ethnic Tibetans.">böpa</span>'s admission was called böshug [Tib. བོད་ཞུགས]. After they get admitted, the khambas become khamtsen gegen and the böbas become khamtsen jama who make fire and tea. These two would get the same extra one share in gye/phog and also get one contaier called chapdra [Tib. ཇ་ཁྲ] of tea equally. When they take over the khamtsen rungkhang, they take it together and also hand over it together. If there is a shortage of money, both jointly have to make it up.   

**A:**  Is <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. ཇ་མ] The monk(s) in charge of a monastery&#x27;s kitchen.">jama</span> a monk's obligation, shamthotre [Tib. ཤམ་ཐབས་ཁྲལ] or do they have to ask for it?   

**A:**  They don't need to ask for it, it was a shamthotre. Both <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. ཁང་ཚན་དགེ་རྒན] The head official of a khamtsen.">khamtsen gegen</span> and <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. ཇ་མ] The monk(s) in charge of a monastery&#x27;s kitchen.">jama</span> are shamthotre. If one didn't do these when his turn comes, he will be expelled from the monastery. Even if you go to another place when you think you are due for khamtsen gegen, you will still be expelled as it is your obligation to be available.   

**Q:**  For the other positions like the grain collector, drudepa [Tib. འབྲུ་འདེད་པ] do they send them from among the <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. ཚོགས་འདུ] 1. The general name for the various types of Tibetan government assemblies. 2. Any assembly, e.g., the assembly (meeting) of monks in a college.">tsondu</span> members ?   

**A:**  Yes they were sent from <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. ཚོགས་འདུ] 1. The general name for the various types of Tibetan government assemblies. 2. Any assembly, e.g., the assembly (meeting) of monks in a college.">tsondu</span> members and they send one partner with him. Sometimes, both were from non-tsondu members because there were only 7-8 monks in Gungru's tsondu and only one person comes to the tsondu in a year. Some of them died and some returned to kham.   

**Q:**  What percent of <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. གྲྭ་རྒྱུན] Monks who came to Drepung, Ganden and Sera from far distances such as Kham and Amdo.">tragyün</span> stay in Drepung during their life time and what percent would return?   

**A:**  When I came to Drepung, there were 76 <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. གྲྭ་རྒྱུན] Monks who came to Drepung, Ganden and Sera from far distances such as Kham and Amdo.">tragyün</span> in Gungru who came along together. We had to do <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. ཁང་ཚན] A monastic residential unit in which monks from specific geographic areas lived. These were corporate entities with property and internal officials. Some large khamtsen had smaller subordinate units called mi tshan. Khamtsen were part of tratsang (colleges). For example, Hamdong Khamtsen was part of Gomang College in Drepung Monastery.">khamtsen</span> <span class="tooltip" data-text="[tib. གཞོན་ཁྲལ] The work obligations all young monks have to do for the monastery (it literally means &quot;youth tax&quot;).">shöndre</span> for 6 years. We had to do whitewashing, sweeping and carrying loads from Lhasa. Then after 6 years, they wouldn't send us around any more. Carrying loads is imposed like a tax from the tratsang. These were divided among the 16 khamtsen and the khamtsen itself would also make us to work. At the end of the 6 years of shöndre, at the Mönlam of the 6th year we had to carry the cooking equipments and those things to Lhasa, but we didn't have to take them back and then the shöndre would be over. At this Mönlam, there were only 24 left. The rest had returned to kham, or lost their celibacy and doing trading to India etc. Then we pooled a little bit money and we went to the households of the rich monks to beg for money in Lhasa and we bought a copper water container as a rememberance on which we engraved the letters, "we, the monks who have finished our shöndre in this year have donated this to the khamtsen as the common gift [Tib. སྤྱི་འཇོག]". Actually, of these 24, only 19 were still living in the monastery at the time of revolt.
