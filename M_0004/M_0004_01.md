**Q:**  Did you become a monk first and then a <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. རྩེ་དྲུང] A monk official in the Tibetan government.">tsidrung</a> (government monk official), or both at the same time?   

**A:**  I went to school first and after that I became a monk.   

**Q:** How old were you when you became a monk?   

**A:** I was 4-5 years old when they made me a monk in the monastery.   

**Q:** Were you in the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. རྩེ་སློབ་གྲྭ] The school for training monk officials in the Potala that was run by the Yigtsang (Ecclesiastic) Office.">Tse labdra</a>?   

**A:**  I went to the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. རྩེ་སློབ་གྲྭ] The school for training monk officials in the Potala that was run by the Yigtsang (Ecclesiastic) Office.">Tse labdra</a> later. First, I went to a Tibetan school and after that I joined the Tse labdra. After I finished the Tse labdra, I offered a <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཁ་བཏགས] A Tibetan ceremonial scarf given to lamas, visitors, etc.">khata</a> along with an application [Tib. ཞབས་སྡོད་སྙན་དར] to become a tsidrung. Then I became a tsidrung.   

**Q:** When you were in the monastery, was your <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ལྟོ་གཏེར་དགེ་རྒན] The &quot;teacher&quot;/guardian in a monastery who provided food and so forth to a young monk.">Toter Gegen</a> a relative of yours?   

**A:**  I didn't have a special <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. དགེ་རྒན] 1. Teacher in a school. 2. In monastic settings it also refers to an adult monk who acted as a guardian to a younger monk. In such cases, the younger monk typically lived in the gegen&#x27;s apartment (shag). In monasteries, however, it could also mean a real teacher, or the monk who served as the guarantor for a new monk.">gegen</a> because I didn't stay in the monastery for a long time because I had to go to school in Lhasa. I just had one gegen who introduced me to the discipline of the monastery.   

**Q:**  When you first joined the monastery, did your family have a plan to make you a monk because you were going to become a <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. རྩེ་དྲུང] A monk official in the Tibetan government.">tsidrung</a> or did they simply just make you a monk?   

**A:** They let me join the [private Tibetan] school at an early age. My father was the oracle of <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. གནས་ཆུང] 1. One of the main protector deities of the Tibetan government and the Dalai Lama. 2. The monastery in which the medium of Nechung resides that is located just east of Drepung Monastery.">Nechung</a> [the state protector deity]. After that, my father didn't get along well with the monastery, and they had a law case and my father got demoted.   

**Q:** Your father was known as the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཆོས་ཟུར] An ex-oracle/medium.">chösur</a> right?   

**A:** Yes. After my father got demoted we came to stay in Lhasa. The <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. སྐུ་ངོ] An honorific term of address for aristocratic officials. It is something like, &quot;Your Excellency.&quot;">kungö</a> of Dakpo Drumpa [Tib. bhrum pa], who had the rank of <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. རྫ་ས] 1. A high rank in the Tibetan government. 2. A top manager-like official for the labrang of important incarnate lamas, especially those who in the past had served as regents of Tibet.">dzasa</a>, didn't get along well with his wife. His wife followed the lama Minling Trichen [Tib. སྨིན་གླིང་ཁྲི་ཆེན]. At that time, her husband was bedridden. The 13th Dalai Lama told my father to take responsibility for the Drumpa family because the Dalai Lama is related to Drumpa. <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. གདོང་པོར] The name of an aristocratic family. The family was also known as Tashi Lingpa [tib. བཀྲིས་གླིང་པ].">Dombor</a> [Tib. གདོང་པོར] and Tsipön Trogawo [Tib. ཁྲོ་དགའ་བོ] were appointed as the assistants with my father to manage the Drumpa household.   

**Q:** That is why people call you Drumpa, right?   

**A:** Yes, I got the name from that. After that, I became a tsidrung.   

**Q:**  At first, when you joined the monastery, did you have the aim to become a <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. རྩེ་དྲུང] A monk official in the Tibetan government.">tsidrung</a>?   

**A:**  Yes. My parents wanted to make me a tsidrung.   

**Q:** How old are you now?   

**A:** I am 71 years old.   

**Q:** In your household, in addition to your parents, were there any other relatives?   

**A:** We had many relatives. Two of our relatives are living in foreign countries. My brother Lhalung Lobsang Phüntso [Tib. ལྷ་ལུང་བློ་གཟང་ཕུན་ཚོགས] is in America and my sister Drönla [Tib. སྒྲོན་ལགས] is in Switzerland.   

**Q:** They went to India in the past, right?   

**A:**  They went to India in the early times [before the uprising]. So at home I had my late father and my stepmother. Our mother died when I was young. Since we had a stepmother at home, we were always unhappy and we, the 4 children, scattered because the stepmother had many children and she was implying that we might do something to her [cause trouble].   

**Q:**  After you joined the monastery, you never lived in the monastery, right?   

**A:** Yes, I didn't stay in the monastery. I stayed in Lhasa.   

**Q:** At that time did you wear monks' robes?   

**A:** They made me a monk's robe and I wore it when I first joined the monastery. But usually I didn't wear the monk's robe. I wore a <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཕྱུ་པ] The traditional Tibetan men and women&#x27;s dress. It is like a robe that is tied at the waist. Both men and women wear such dresses, although they differ slightly in color and in style.">chupa</a> because I had to go to the school.   

**Q:** Which school did you go to? For example at that time there were schools like the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ནང་རོང་ཤག] Name of a private school in Lhasa (and the house in which is was located).">Nyarongsha</a> School?   

**A:**  At first I went to school in Yükhagang [Tib. གཡུལ་ཁ་སྒང].   

**Q:** Who established the school in Yükhagang?   

**A:** The clerk of Andrutsang [Tib. ཨ་འབྲུག་ཚང], who was a very old man, set up the school.   

**Q:** In that school they taught Tibetan, right?   

**A:** Yes. They taught only Tibetan. So my <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. དགེ་རྒན] 1. Teacher in a school. 2. In monastic settings it also refers to an adult monk who acted as a guardian to a younger monk. In such cases, the younger monk typically lived in the gegen&#x27;s apartment (shag). In monasteries, however, it could also mean a real teacher, or the monk who served as the guarantor for a new monk.">gegen</a> kept me in Yükhagang. After my gegen died, I joined the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ནང་རོང་ཤག] Name of a private school in Lhasa (and the house in which is was located).">Nyarongsha</a> School. At that time, the school was located in Gokhangser [Tib. གོ་བོ་ཁང་སེར], but later they moved the school.   

**Q:** How long did you study in that school?   

**A:** I studied there for 12-13 years.   

**Q:** The school was run privately?   

**A:** Yes.   

**Q:**  Did you have to go to school every day or what?   

**A:** Yes. I had to go to the school every day.   

**Q:** Did you have to go to school early in the morning?   

**A:** Yes.   

**Q:** What would you do in the school? During most of the time, would you learn the writing system?   

**A:**  We had to learn writing and we had to read pecha. In the morning, at first, we had to do reading. After that, we went home for breakfast. After breakfast, we had to do handwriting all day long. According to the tradition in Tibet, we had to do handwriting until sunset.   

**Q:** When did you apply for the post of <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. རྩེ་དྲུང] A monk official in the Tibetan government.">tsidrung</a> and at that time, how old were you?   

**A:**  At the age of 16, I applied to become a tsidrung.   

**Q:**  Your father was still alive then, right?  

**A:**  Yes.   

**Q:**  As you know, to apply for the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. རྩེ་དྲུང] A monk official in the Tibetan government.">tsidrung</a> was not easy and you had to visit the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. དྲུང་ཡིག་ཆེན་མོ] The title of the four heads of the Yigtsang Office (Ecclesiastics Office).">drunyichemmo</a>, and also the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཡིག་ཚང] The highest office dealing with monastic and religious affairs in the traditional Tibetan government. It is often called the Ecclesiastic Office. It was headed by 4 fourth rank monk officials called Trunyichemmo. The senior Trunyichemmo was called Ta Lama.">Yigtsang</a> Nyerpa and other officials. The Yigtsang would then send the application to the Dalai Lama for his approval. Therefore, when you were applying for the tsidrung post, did you have a hard time, and how did you bribe them and how did you find the backdoor relations? Tell me about your own experience.   

**A:**  When I applied for the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. རྩེ་དྲུང] A monk official in the Tibetan government.">tsidrung</a>, I didn't have much of a hard time because my father knew the officials. Actually, it was hard to apply to be a tsidrung.   

**Q:** At that time, your father had a good backer, so you didn't have a hard time, right?   

**A:** Yes, My father knew the officials, so I didn't have a hard time to apply to become a tsidrung.   

**Q:** You applied for the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. རྩེ་དྲུང] A monk official in the Tibetan government.">tsidrung</a> in the name of Drumpa, right?   

**A:**  People were just calling me Drumpa, but I didn't become a <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. རྩེ་དྲུང] A monk official in the Tibetan government.">tsidrung</a> on the name of Dakpo Drumpa. I applied to it as a simple monk.   

**Q:** So you applied to be a <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. རྩེ་དྲུང] A monk official in the Tibetan government.">tsidrung</a> using your own name, right?   

**A:** Yes. If I had applied using the name of Drumpa, it wouldn't have been good because the Drumpa [family] had sons. So I didn't use the Drumpa family name because in the future we might get into trouble. Among the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. རྩེ་དྲུང] A monk official in the Tibetan government.">tsidrung</a> and in Lhasa, they called me Drumpa as a nickname. People in Lhasa didn't know my name and they just called me Drumpa la. That's how I got the name of Drumpa.   

**Q:**  What was the official procedure to become a <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. རྩེ་དྲུང] A monk official in the Tibetan government.">tsidrung</a>? Did you have to ask the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཡིག་ཚང] The highest office dealing with monastic and religious affairs in the traditional Tibetan government. It is often called the Ecclesiastic Office. It was headed by 4 fourth rank monk officials called Trunyichemmo. The senior Trunyichemmo was called Ta Lama.">Yigtsang</a> to become a tsidrung, and did you have to go to do the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. མི་བབ་སྤྱན་ཞུ] The ceremony at which candidates for a position present themselves before officials (or the Dalai Lama/Regent) so that the higher officials can see firsthand what the candidate looks like. A visual inspection of candidates.">mibab jenshu</a> and what were the actual steps?   

**A:**  At first we had to go to do the mibab jenshu.   

**Q:**  To go to do the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. མི་བབ་སྤྱན་ཞུ] The ceremony at which candidates for a position present themselves before officials (or the Dalai Lama/Regent) so that the higher officials can see firsthand what the candidate looks like. A visual inspection of candidates.">mibab jenshu</a> must be the last procedure, right? What was the first thing you had to do. For example, like submitting an application?   

**A:** At first, we had to submit the test of our hand writing first to the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཡིག་ཚང] The highest office dealing with monastic and religious affairs in the traditional Tibetan government. It is often called the Ecclesiastic Office. It was headed by 4 fourth rank monk officials called Trunyichemmo. The senior Trunyichemmo was called Ta Lama.">Yigtsang</a> along with a khata. After that, one's own family members would have go to remind them about this. If they said that you would be among the candidates, then they would call you to do the mibab jenshu.   

**Q:** Tashi Tsering: In the past, when I was a clerk in the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. རྩེ་ཕྱག] 1. The Treasury Office that was located in the Potala and supplied items for the Dalai Lama. 2. The name/title of the officials who headed the Tseja Office.">Tseja</a>, I also took the hand writing exam. I had to submit a hand writing sample which was written beforehand, and then they made me write another one in the Rabsel [Tib. རབ་གསལ] house. So when you took the writing test to be a <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. རྩེ་དྲུང] A monk official in the Tibetan government.">tsidrung</a> did you have a similar system?   

**A:**  No. When I was applying for the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. རྩེ་དྲུང] A monk official in the Tibetan government.">tsidrung</a> post, I had to write the hand writing sample in my <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. 1. ཤག, 2. ཞག] 1. The apartment/room of a monk. 2. The butter fat that coagulates on the top of butter-tea when the tea is left to sit for some time. If the tea had been made with a lot of butter, this layer could be thick enough to scoop off and save to later sell or eat separately. The senior monks are usually served tea with a lot of shag.">shag</a> and submit it over to the drunyichemmo. They would check the sample and submit it to the Dalai Lama. The Dalai Lama would check this and give the approval for those who were qualified.   

**Q:** Did you have to do the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. མི་བབ་སྤྱན་ཞུ] The ceremony at which candidates for a position present themselves before officials (or the Dalai Lama/Regent) so that the higher officials can see firsthand what the candidate looks like. A visual inspection of candidates.">mibab jenshu</a> after you submitted your writing test?   

**A:** We have to submit our writing sample just before doing the mibab jenshu. The <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཡིག་ཚང] The highest office dealing with monastic and religious affairs in the traditional Tibetan government. It is often called the Ecclesiastic Office. It was headed by 4 fourth rank monk officials called Trunyichemmo. The senior Trunyichemmo was called Ta Lama.">Yigtsang</a> would call those who were selected to be candidates and inform them of the date to come and do the mibab jenshu. On that day, you had to wear monks' robes and go there.   

**Q:** At that time, since Reting was the regent, you had to do the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. མི་བབ་སྤྱན་ཞུ] The ceremony at which candidates for a position present themselves before officials (or the Dalai Lama/Regent) so that the higher officials can see firsthand what the candidate looks like. A visual inspection of candidates.">mibab jenshu</a> before the Regent, right?   

**A:** You are right. We all had to stand there and the regent looked at us and then he would go in would give the names of those he approved. After that, we had to go to <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཡིག་ཚང] The highest office dealing with monastic and religious affairs in the traditional Tibetan government. It is often called the Ecclesiastic Office. It was headed by 4 fourth rank monk officials called Trunyichemmo. The senior Trunyichemmo was called Ta Lama.">Yigtsang</a> where they would read the names of those who got approved to be a tsidrung. The rest of them had to go home.   

**Q:** Those who didn't get the chance to be a <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. རྩེ་དྲུང] A monk official in the Tibetan government.">tsidrung</a> would they then get another chance in the future?   

**A:**  Yes. They would get a chance sooner or later.

**A:**  I stayed in the school for one and half years. I didn't have to stay in the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. རྩེ་སློབ་གྲྭ] The school for training monk officials in the Potala that was run by the Yigtsang (Ecclesiastic) Office.">Tse labdra</a> long because I had already studied in the school in Lhasa where I had learned writing and reading.   

**Q:** After that, what did you do?   

**A:** After I became a <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. རྩེ་དྲུང] A monk official in the Tibetan government.">tsidrung</a>, for 3-4 months I just had to attend the drungja. I didn't have any other work. After 3-4 months, I worked as a staff official [Tib. ལས་བྱ] in the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཡིག་ཚང] The highest office dealing with monastic and religious affairs in the traditional Tibetan government. It is often called the Ecclesiastic Office. It was headed by 4 fourth rank monk officials called Trunyichemmo.

This large administrative unit was headed by one or two district heads (tib. dzongpön [རྫོང་དཔོན]) appointed by the Tibetan government. Typically there was one lay official and one monk official who were jointly sent from Lhasa for three year terms. They were responsible for collecting taxes and adjudicating disputes in their district. These dzong were equivalent to counties (ch. 县) in the current Chinese system of administration.">dzong</a> and/or shiga. After that, they appointed me as caretaker of the golden stupa [Tib. གསེར་སྡོང] called Phende Wömba [Tib. ཕན་བདེ་འོད་འབར] [where the remains of the Dalai Lama was kept.]   

**Q:** Which golden stupa was that?

**Q:** But you would get more income than working as a staff officer, right?

Generally, donggos had associated endowments that monks used by turns to fund a donggo. The monk with the donggo obligation would lend out the capital of the endowment and pay for the event from the interest he collected. This was also used for ritual obligations of government offices like the Tseja Office.">donggo</a> ritual in the monastery?

**A:** Yes.

**A:**  Yes.

**A:** Yes. I only got shares from the khamtsen.   

**Q:** Usually, or sometimes, would you go to the monastery?   

**A:** If I had something to do, I would go to the monastery.   

**Q:** What kind of work did you do after you became the caretaker of the golden stupa?   

**A:**  After that, since I was an ordinary <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. རྩེ་དྲུང] A monk official in the Tibetan government.">tsidrung</a>, it was hard to earn a living. So I went with Lhalu [Tib. ལྷ་ཀླུ] [the Dome jigyab] to Chamdo as [part of] his staff.   

**Q:** How long did you stay in Dome [Kham]?   

**A:** I stayed there for 4-5 years.   

**Q:**  That was just before the Chinese came to Tibet, right?   

**A:** Yes. That was in 1947-48, just before the Chinese came.   

**Q:**  At that time, how many <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. རྩེ་དྲུང] A monk official in the Tibetan government.">tsidrung</a> and how many lay officials were there with Lhalu?   

**A:** We had 5 <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. རྩེ་དྲུང] A monk official in the Tibetan government.">tsidrung</a> and there were more lay officials, like the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. བཀའ་དྲུང] Lay officials who worked as administrative aides/secretaries to the Kalön of the Kashag.">gadrung</a> and the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. བཀའ་མགྲོན] The position of aide to the Kashag that was filled by lay aristocratic officials.">gandrön</a> in the Kashag. In Chamdo, I was only writing things for the Kashag and I didn't have any other work.   

**Q:** After you came to Chamdo, did you get a salary or did you get a <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཐབ་རྟེན] A manorial estate that is given to an official as his salary.">thabden</a>?   

**A:**  No. They would send us to work as a tsasho in places like Markham [Tib. སྨར་ཁམས], Lhodzong [Tib. ལྷོ་རྫོང], and Derge [Tib. སྡེ་དགེ] Dzongs, and to Derge Kamthog [Tib. སྐམ་ཐོག].   

**Q:** The tsasho is not the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. རྫོང་དཔོན] The head of a dzong in the traditional Tibetan government.">dzongpön</a>, right?   

**A:** Yes. The tsasho is only for collecting the salt taxes and other trade taxes. It was not a dzongpön.   

**Q:** Did you become the wool tax collector?   

**A:** No. I collected both the salt taxes and the trade taxes [Tib. ཚོང་ཁྲལ].   

**Q:** From that there was a little bit income, right?   

**A:** Yes. There was a little bit of income and we didn't have any salary.   

**Q:** Later, the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. རྫོང] A district in the traditional Tibetan governmental structure. This large administrative unit was headed by one or two district heads (tib. dzongpön [རྫོང་དཔོན]) appointed by the Tibetan government. Typically there was one lay official and one monk official who were jointly sent from Lhasa for three year terms. They were responsible for collecting taxes and adjudicating disputes in their district. These dzong were equivalent to counties (ch. 县) in the current Chinese system of administration.">dzong</a> and the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. གཞིས་ཀ] A manorial estate.">shiga</a> were managed by the government and they paid salary to the dzongpön, right?   

**A:** Yes. That was just before the Chinese came to Tibet. At that time, we, the ordinary <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. རྩེ་དྲུང] A monk official in the Tibetan government.">tsidrung</a>, would get 120 <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཁལ] A traditional volume measurement used for measuring grain in traditional Tibetan society. Sizes of this unit varied somewhat, but the official government khe (called mkhar ru or bstan dzin mkha ru) weighed about 28-31 pounds for barley. It was used to convey the size of fields. For example, a field said to be 10 khe in size meant that 10 khe of seed could be sown on that field.">khe</a> of grain per year. [Note that system was actually started in 1956.]  

**Q:** Wasn't that was after they set up the Legjö or Reform Office?   

**A:** Yes. They said that they would pay the salary, but they said we have to go to Lhoka to get it. Anyway, we didn't get much salary in our hands. We just sold the authorization paper to collect salary from high ranking people and from doing that we got a little bit of money from them, and we made our living like this. After the Granary Office [Tib. འབྲུ་ཁང་ལས་ཁུངས] was set up, I got a salary payment only once, although it had been many years since it was decided to pay the salaries.   

**Q:**  When Ngabö went to Chamdo and Lhalu came back to Lhasa, were you with Lhalu or did you have to stay in Chamdo?   

**A:**  Lhalu left us in Chamdo. When Ngabö came to Chamdo, Lhalu threw a party. After that, Lhalu went back right away and he didn't even stay for one day.   

**Q:** Did the Chinese arrest you in Chamdo?   

**A:** Yes, they arrested us in Chamdo and they robbed our property. After that, we came back to Lhasa by foot, walking.   

**Q:** Ngabö had all the staff's officers with him, right?   

**A:** No. Ngabö was told to keep all of Lhalu's staff officers who were in Chamdo.   

**Q:**  I heard that after you people passed over a pass called Lagong La [Tib. ལ་གོང་ལ], the Chinese arrived there and you were unable to go (past that place), is that right?   

**A:**  Yes, when Ngabö and other people ran away and when they were going down from the Namtso [Tib. གནམ་མཚོ] Mountain Pass, the Chinese surrounded the mountain and they couldn't get through.   

**Q:** I heard that Depön Muja [Tib. མུ་བྱ] said if we had fought with the Chinese, then we would have been able to get through, right?   

**A:**  He just said that verbally, but he didn't fire a single shot. Before the Chinese came, he had already left for somewhere. This was said by his soldiers.   

**Q:** Did he run away?   

**A:** Yes, he ran away to Chamdo.   

**Q:** When did you come to Lhasa?   

**A:** I came to Lhasa slowly after the Chinese came up to Lhasa.   

**Q:** When did you arrive in Lhasa?   

**A:** I think I came to Lhasa in 1950. I came slowly, like on a pilgrimage.   

**Q:** Did you have a very hard time?   

**A:** Yes. Nobody took care of me.   

**Q:** All of your belongings were taken away, right?   

**A:** The weapons and the animals were taken by the Chinese. Other better belongings were taken by the Khambas in the lodging inns where we stayed. At that time, we were just thinking how we could run away and we didn't have any idea of taking care of our things.   

**Q:** When you came to Lhasa, did you work again as a government official?   

**A:** When we came to Lhasa we had to report our arrival [Tib. འབྱོར་ཕྱག] to the superiors and had to attend the ceremonies because we were still shungshab. But at that time, the Dalai Lama was not in Lhasa, and all the officials were kind of new and the situation was in a kind of chaos.   

**Q:** He went to <a href="#" data-tooltip="[ch. 亚东] The Chinese name for the Tibetan town called Tromo that is located on the Sikkim border.">Yadong</a>, right?   

**A:** Yes. The situation was disturbed. Among us, some people like Muja and Karchungwa [Tib. དཀར་བྱུང་བ] went to visit the officials when they were at home, so they got jobs (positions). But we didn't get anything.   

**Q:** So what did you do during that period?   

**A:** I just stayed in between [work] for awhile. Later when the Preparatory Committee of the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. བོད་རང་སྐྱོང་ལྗོང] Tibet Autonomous Region">TAR</a> [abbreviation   PCTAR] was set up, since I knew some oil printing before that, the TAR told the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཡིག་ཚང] The highest office dealing with monastic and religious affairs in the traditional Tibetan government. It is often called the Ecclesiastic Office. It was headed by 4 fourth rank monk officials called Trunyichemmo. The senior Trunyichemmo was called Ta Lama.">Yigtsang</a> to send me to work for them. So I was sent there [to] do the printing and I finally got a job.   

**Q:** At that time, they would pay you <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ད་ཡང; ch. 大洋] A Chinese silver dollar that had the image of Yuan Shikai on its face. It was used by the Chinese government in Tibet in the 1950s because Tibetans did not accept Chinese paper currency.">dayan</a> for your salary, right?   

**A:** I got about 70 dayan.   

**Q:** Was that per month?   

**A:** Yes.   

**Q:**  I don't understand who set up the Preparatory Committee? Did the Chinese set that up or was it <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. སྡེ་བ་གཞུང] The name of the traditional Tibetan government.">dewashung</a>?   

**A:**  The Preparatory Committee was set up jointly by the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. སྡེ་བ་གཞུང] The name of the traditional Tibetan government.">dewashung</a> and the Chinese through discussions. In it, there were half Tibetans and half Chinese.   

**Q:** So you worked in there until 1959?   

**A:** I worked there until the revolt in 1959. I did printing. Usually I would work until noon and then I would go home.   

**Q:**  At that time, you were playing mahjong, right?   

**A:** Yes, I would play mahjong and just hang around.   

**Q:** Did you do any business/trading?   

**A:** No. Let alone doing business, it was hard for me to get food then because I didn't have anything. After we left Chamdo we were arrested and when we were released from the prison, I only had my bedding and a cushion.   

**Q:** You were a prisoner in 1959, right?   

**A:** At the time of [the] revolt, we didn't stay in the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. བོད་རང་སྐྱོང་ལྗོང་གྲ་སྒྲིགས་ཨུ་ཡོན་ལྷན་ཁང] The Preparatory Committee for [the implementation of] the Tibet Autonomous Region.">PCTAR</a> but we went to protect the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཇོ་ཁང] A most famous temple in Lhasa that houses a holy statue of the Buddha. It is often used to mean the Tsuglagang Temple of which it is a part.">Jokhang</a>, so I was arrested.   

**Q:** So the Chinese considered that you were involved in the revolt?   

**A:** Yes, they said that we were reactionaries and shut us up in prison.   

**Q:**  At first, where did they lock you up?   

**A:** At first I was arrested and locked up in Taring [Tib. ཕྲེང་རིང] Prison. From Taring, I was sent to Bari [Tib. བྲག་རི] Hermitage to work as a cook for some prisoners who were working there.   

**Q:**  Altogether, how long did you stay in the prison?   

**A:**  I was in prison from 1959 until December 1981. I stayed in prison for 22 years. At first they told us, "You should work hard and you will get released soon, at the time of [the] first of October [Ch. shi yi] [holiday]." After that, they were saying, "You will be released on the first of May [Ch. wu yi]." So they just pushed back the date like that.   

**Q:** When you were in Lhasa in [the] 1950s, did you have any contact with the [Drepung] monastery?   

**A:** No. I didn't have any contact with the monastery.   

**Q:** So you just had the name that you had joined the monastery, right?   

**A:** Yes. It was just in name only.   

**Q:** Were most of the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. རྩེ་དྲུང] A monk official in the Tibetan government.">tsidrung</a> like you, that is people who just joined the monastery in name only, but they didn't stay in the monastery?   

**A:** Yes. They all were the same as me, and they didn't stay in the monastery.   

**Q:** Monks have great loyalty to their <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. གྲྭ་ཚང] A &quot;college&quot; within a monastery, for example, in Drepung Monastery there were four main tratsang: Gomang, Loseling, Deyang and Ngagpa. These tratsang were property owning corporate entities and included monks who were organized into residential dormitories called Khamtsen.">tratsang</a>. Did you have loyalty like this to your tratsang?   

**A:**  In the monastery, the monastic officials were very powerful, but we [government monk officials] didn't have any power in the monastery.   

**Q:** Did you have loyalty to your own <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. བློ་གསལ་གླིང] One of the main colleges in Drepung Monastery.">Loseling</a> Tratsang?   

**A:** When we had a little money, we would perform a <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. བཏོང་སྒོ] An obligation to carry out a rite or prayer session in a monastery. For example, providing food and tea for all the monks in one&#x27;s monastic college at a prayer assembly. Or it could be an obligation to give all the monks a set amount of grain or the donggo obligation that many monastery office holders had to do when they left office. Generally, donggos had associated endowments that monks used by turns to fund a donggo. The monk with the donggo obligation would lend out the capital of the endowment and pay for the event from the interest he collected. This was also used for ritual obligations of government offices like the Tseja Office.">donggo</a> in one's own tratsang. When we didn't have money, we wouldn't do it.   

**Q:** Were most of the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. རྩེ་དྲུང] A monk official in the Tibetan government.">tsidrung</a> like this?   

**A:** Yes. Some of the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. རྩེ་དྲུང] A monk official in the Tibetan government.">tsidrung</a> had good shagtsang. Otherwise, most of the tsidrung were not rich.   

**Q:** In 1950, there were some troubles in the monastery, for example in <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. སྒོ་མང] One of the large colleges in Drepung Monastery.">Gomang</a> College, they had problems and the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. བླ་རྒྱུད་པ] A term for the common monks in a monastery (in contrast to the scholar monks who were actively studying the Buddhist doctrine).">lagyüba</a> and <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. དཔེ་ཆ་བ] A monk studying the monastic philosophical curriculum. A scholar monk.">pechawa</a> got into a fight. Did you and other <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. རྩེ་དྲུང] A monk official in the Tibetan government.">tsidrung</a> hear about this?   

**A:**  Among us they didn't talk about that because we were separate from the monastery.   

**Q:** Do you know about the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ལྡབ་ལྡོབ] A mildly deviant type of fighting or &quot;punk&quot; monk who engaged in fighting and other unusual behaviors for monks in traditional Tibet&#x27;s large monasteries.">dobdo</a>'s <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ལྟོ་ཚང] 1. The club of the Dobdos. 2. A group of people eating together.">tobtsang</a>? I heard that the government ordered the tobtsang disbanded. Do you know about that?   

**A:** The <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ལྟོ་ཚང] 1. The club of the Dobdos. 2. A group of people eating together.">tobtsang</a> was not disbanded by the government.   

**Q:** The government didn't disband the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ལྡབ་ལྡོབ] A mildly deviant type of fighting or &quot;punk&quot; monk who engaged in fighting and other unusual behaviors for monks in traditional Tibet&#x27;s large monasteries.">dobdo</a>, but when <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. སྒོ་མང] One of the large colleges in Drepung Monastery.">Gomang</a> and <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. སེ་ར་སྨད] The Mey (Me) College of Sera Monastery.">Sera Mey</a> were doing the competition where jumping was the main event, <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཕྱོགས་རྒྱག] A kind of monks&#x27; competitive &quot;sports&quot; event (mostly jumping and throwing) done by dobdo monks.">chogyag</a>, the government stopped it, is that right?   

**A:** The <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ལྡབ་ལྡོབ] A mildly deviant type of fighting or &quot;punk&quot; monk who engaged in fighting and other unusual behaviors for monks in traditional Tibet&#x27;s large monasteries.">dobdo</a> had their own <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. སྐྱིད་སྡུག] An association, club.">kyidu</a>. In the kyidu, they had their seniority. The government didn't stop the tobtsang. What happened was when the Dalai Lama was young, one dobdo had long hair behind his ears which we call dobtra. So the Dalai Lama grabbed his hair because he had the long hair when he was wearing a monk's robe.   

**Q:** Where did that happen?   

**A:** That happened in Potala at an official ceremony. When people were going to seek the audience with the Dalai Lama, he grabbed his hair and asked him, "What is this? This is not good." Since then the monks were not allowed to keep their dobtra.  

**Q:** When did that happen?   

**A:** That was when the Dalai Lama was young.   

**Q:** At that time, had the Chinese come?   

**A:** It was before the Chinese came to Tibet.   

**Q:** Did you hear about them stopping the jumping competition?   

**A:** No. The <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཁང་ཚན] A monastic residential unit in which monks from specific geographic areas lived. These were corporate entities with property and internal officials. Some large khamtsen had smaller subordinate units called mi tshan. Khamtsen were part of tratsang (colleges). For example, Hamdong Khamtsen was part of Gomang College in Drepung Monastery.">khamtsen</a> and the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. གྲྭ་ཚང] A &quot;college&quot; within a monastery, for example, in Drepung Monastery there were four main tratsang: Gomang, Loseling, Deyang and Ngagpa. These tratsang were property owning corporate entities and included monks who were organized into residential dormitories called Khamtsen.">tratsang</a> stopped the jumping competition. That was because when they did the jumping competition, the monks were fighting and even killing many people, each other. The khamtsen made some of them to leave [Tib. གཏོར] the [dobdo] kyidu.   

**Q:** Who stopped the jumping competition first? Did they stop it in Sera monastery?   

**A:** At first Sera stopped it because Sera monks fought the first time in Bontö [Tib. འབྲོམ་སྟོད] when <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. བློ་གསལ་གླིང] One of the main colleges in Drepung Monastery.">Loseling</a> and <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. སེ་ར་བྱེས] The Jey (Je) College of Sera Monastery.">Sera Jey</a> were doing the jumping competition. It was not kind of playing games because from the beginning they were carrying guns. So later on, the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. གྲྭ་ཚང] A &quot;college&quot; within a monastery, for example, in Drepung Monastery there were four main tratsang: Gomang, Loseling, Deyang and Ngagpa. These tratsang were property owning corporate entities and included monks who were organized into residential dormitories called Khamtsen.">tratsang</a> held a discussion and they decided to stop the jumping competition.   

**Q:** When did they stop the jumping competition? Was that before the Chinese came or after the Chinese came?   

**A:** That was just before the Chinese came.   

**Q:** That was just after the Sera War, right?   

**A:** That was after the Sera War.   

**Q:** When the Chinese came in the 1950's, there were some changes, like setting up offices, like the Legjö Office and the Gyöship Legung Office [Tib. གྱོད་ཞིབ་ལས་ཁུངས], which was a branch of the judicial system where civil disputes were settled, etc. At that time, what kind of impression did you people have?   

**A:** At that time, we didn't think about those things much because no one was taking care of us [Tib. བདག་པོ་རྒྱག་མཁན་མེད་པ] and we didn't have any way to meddle in those matters. So we were just in between, passing our time. If there was a chance to express our opinions, we might have had some opinions, but we didn't have the chance to say anything. So we just regarded whatever they did from above as correct.   

**Q:** In [the] 1950s, even though the Chinese came to Tibet, in the monastery the monks were doing everything the same as before. For example, studying and giving out loans. Everything remained [the] same as before the Chinese came, right?   

**A:** Yes, when the Chinese first came to Tibet, they did very good, and they offered <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. མང་ཇ] The morning tea served to monks from all the monastic colleges at the main prayer assembly hall.">mangja</a> for the monk's [prayer] assembly and they gave alms. So the monks were staying as before doing their studying and nobody was creating disturbances. After 1959, the Chinese said the monks were not allowed to hold the Mönlam Festival and were not allowed to do the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཚོགས་མཆོད] The large religious prayer festival held in Lhasa in the 2nd Tibetan lunar month.">Tsongjö</a> Sebang procession that took place on the 30th day of the second lunar month, and they also said that it would not be okay if the monks gathered to do prayer assemblies. Therefore, the monks became mentally against the Chinese and they started causing disturbances.   

**Q:** The monks were not thinking that [the] Chinese would do that, right?   

**A:** Yes, the monks didn't think it would happen like that, and the monks were just studying in their <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. 1. ཤག, 2. ཞག] 1. The apartment/room of a monk. 2. The butter fat that coagulates on the top of butter-tea when the tea is left to sit for some time. If the tea had been made with a lot of butter, this layer could be thick enough to scoop off and save to later sell or eat separately. The senior monks are usually served tea with a lot of shag.">shag</a> and going to the tsog. It just happened all of a sudden.   

**Q:** What did you think when the Preparatory Committee of the <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. བོད་རང་སྐྱོང་ལྗོང] Tibet Autonomous Region">TAR</a> was set up? Did you think that [it] was bad or good?   

**A:**  We were saying, "This is not good. And one day they will tighten this like a <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཞྭ་མོ; ch. 戴帽] 1. A regular hat, cap. 2. A common political slang term (label) used for people who were classified as class enemies or reactionaries. It was used politically as, &quot;They put the hat on him,&quot; or &quot;They never took his hat off.&quot;">hat</a> made from wet skin [Tib. ཀོ་བ་རློན་པའི་ཞྭ་མོ]. Now it looks nice and they are giving <a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ད་ཡང; ch. 大洋] A Chinese silver dollar that had the image of Yuan Shikai on its face. It was used by the Chinese government in Tibet in the 1950s because Tibetans did not accept Chinese paper currency.">dayan</a>, but later they will make it [policy] tight."   

**Q:** This was commonly said and most of [the] people had that opinion, right?   

**A:** Yes. Most of the people were thinking like t<a href="#" data-tooltip="[tib. ཞྭ་མོ; ch. 戴帽] 1. A regular hat, cap. 2. A common political slang term (label) used for people who were classified as class enemies or reactionaries. It was used politically as, &quot;They put the hat on him,&quot; or &quot;They never took his hat off.&quot;">hat</a>. In the monastery the monks were also saying like that. But at that time, no one was taking care of us. This was just before the revolt. You know the representative of Ganden (Monastery) who has pockmarks on his face? He and some other people were saying at the meeting, "Now, who knows! We don't have any idea. Anyway, I think they [Chinese] are doing to us like putting on us a hat made from wet skin. One day, they will make us suffer like we would have to vomit." The meeting was held in the Potala and they were talking about whether we should fight or not. Some people said that we shouldn't fight with them and we should negotiate with the Chinese. And some of them were saying that we should fight with the Chinese.

But we were just saying it was not good that the Chinese had come.
