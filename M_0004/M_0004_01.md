### Tape   
**Q:**  Did you become a monk first and then a tsidrung (government monk official), or both at the same time?   

**A:**  I went to school first and after that I became a monk.   

**Q:** How old were you when you became a monk?   

**A:** I was 4-5 years old when they made me a monk in the monastery.   

**Q:** Were you in the Tse labdra?   

**A:**  I went to the Tse labdra later. First, I went to a Tibetan school and after that I joined the Tse labdra. After I finished the Tse labdra, I offered a khata along with an application [Tib. zhabs sdod snyan dar] to become a tsidrung. Then I became a tsidrung.   

**Q:** When you were in the monastery, was your Toter Gegen a relative of yours?   

**A:**  I didn't have a special gegen because I didn't stay in the monastery for a long time because I had to go to school in Lhasa. I just had one gegen who introduced me to the discipline of the monastery.   

**Q:**  When you first joined the monastery, did your family have a plan to make you a monk because you were going to become a tsidrung or did they simply just make you a monk?   

**A:** They let me join the [private Tibetan] school at an early age. My father was the oracle of Nechung [the state protector deity]. After that, my father didn't get along well with the monastery, and they had a law case and my father got demoted.   

**Q:** Your father was known as the chösur right?   

**A:** Yes. After my father got demoted we came to stay in Lhasa. The kungö of Dakpo Drumpa [Tib. bhrum pa], who had the rank of dzasa, didn't get along well with his wife. His wife followed the lama Minling Trichen [Tib. smin gling khri chen]. At that time, her husband was bedridden. The 13th Dalai Lama told my father to take responsibility for the Drumpa family because the Dalai Lama is related to Drumpa. Dombor [Tib. gdong por] and Tsipön Trogawo [Tib. khro dga' bo] were appointed as the assistants with my father to manage the Drumpa household.   

**Q:** That is why people call you Drumpa, right?   

**A:** Yes, I got the name from that. After that, I became a tsidrung.   

**Q:**  At first, when you joined the monastery, did you have the aim to become a tsidrung?   

**A:**  Yes. My parents wanted to make me a tsidrung.   

**Q:** How old are you now?   

**A:** I am 71 years old.   

**Q:** In your household, in addition to your parents, were there any other relatives?   

**A:** We had many relatives. Two of our relatives are living in foreign countries. My brother Lhalung Lobsang Phüntso [Tib. lha lung blo gzang phun tshogs] is in America and my sister Drönla [Tib. sgron lags] is in Switzerland.   

**Q:** They went to India in the past, right?   

**A:**  They went to India in the early times [before the uprising]. So at home I had my late father and my stepmother. Our mother died when I was young. Since we had a stepmother at home, we were always unhappy and we, the 4 children, scattered because the stepmother had many children and she was implying that we might do something to her [cause trouble].   

**Q:**  After you joined the monastery, you never lived in the monastery, right?   

**A:** Yes, I didn't stay in the monastery. I stayed in Lhasa.   

**Q:** At that time did you wear monks' robes?   

**A:** They made me a monk's robe and I wore it when I first joined the monastery. But usually I didn't wear the monk's robe. I wore a chupa because I had to go to the school.   

**Q:** Which school did you go to? For example at that time there were schools like the Nyarongsha School?   

**A:**  At first I went to school in Yükhagang [Tib. g.yul kha sgang].   

**Q:** Who established the school in Yükhagang?   

**A:** The clerk of Andrutsang [Tib. a 'brug tshang], who was a very old man, set up the school.   

**Q:** In that school they taught Tibetan, right?   

**A:** Yes. They taught only Tibetan. So my gegen kept me in Yükhagang. After my gegen died, I joined the Nyarongsha School. At that time, the school was located in Gokhangser [Tib. go bo khang ser], but later they moved the school.   

**Q:** How long did you study in that school?   

**A:** I studied there for 12-13 years.   

**Q:** The school was run privately?   

**A:** Yes.   

**Q:**  Did you have to go to school every day or what?   

**A:** Yes. I had to go to the school every day.   

**Q:** Did you have to go to school early in the morning?   

**A:** Yes.   

**Q:** What would you do in the school? During most of the time, would you learn the writing system?   

**A:**  We had to learn writing and we had to read pecha. In the morning, at first, we had to do reading. After that, we went home for breakfast. After breakfast, we had to do handwriting all day long. According to the tradition in Tibet, we had to do handwriting until sunset.   

**Q:** When did you apply for the post of tsidrung and at that time, how old were you?   

**A:**  At the age of 16, I applied to become a tsidrung.   

**Q:**  Your father was still alive then, right?  

**A:**  Yes.   

**Q:**  As you know, to apply for the tsidrung was not easy and you had to visit the drunyichemmo, and also the Yigtsang Nyerpa and other officials. The Yigtsang would then send the application to the Dalai Lama for his approval. Therefore, when you were applying for the tsidrung post, did you have a hard time, and how did you bribe them and how did you find the backdoor relations? Tell me about your own experience.   

**A:**  When I applied for the tsidrung, I didn't have much of a hard time because my father knew the officials. Actually, it was hard to apply to be a tsidrung.   

**Q:** At that time, your father had a good backer, so you didn't have a hard time, right?   

**A:** Yes, My father knew the officials, so I didn't have a hard time to apply to become a tsidrung.   

**Q:** You applied for the tsidrung in the name of Drumpa, right?   

**A:**  People were just calling me Drumpa, but I didn't become a tsidrung on the name of Dakpo Drumpa. I applied to it as a simple monk.   

**Q:** So you applied to be a tsidrung using your own name, right?   

**A:** Yes. If I had applied using the name of Drumpa, it wouldn't have been good because the Drumpa [family] had sons. So I didn't use the Drumpa family name because in the future we might get into trouble. Among the tsidrung and in Lhasa, they called me Drumpa as a nickname. People in Lhasa didn't know my name and they just called me Drumpa la. That's how I got the name of Drumpa.   

**Q:**  What was the official procedure to become a tsidrung? Did you have to ask the Yigtsang to become a tsidrung, and did you have to go to do the mibab jenshu and what were the actual steps?   

**A:**  At first we had to go to do the mibab jenshu.   

**Q:**  To go to do the mibab jenshu must be the last procedure, right? What was the first thing you had to do. For example, like submitting an application?   

**A:** At first, we had to submit the test of our hand writing first to the Yigtsang along with a khata. After that, one's own family members would have go to remind them about this. If they said that you would be among the candidates, then they would call you to do the mibab jenshu.   

**Q:** Tashi Tsering: In the past, when I was a clerk in the Tseja, I also took the hand writing exam. I had to submit a hand writing sample which was written beforehand, and then they made me write another one in the Rabsel [Tib. rab gsal] house. So when you took the writing test to be a tsidrung did you have a similar system?   

**A:**  No. When I was applying for the tsidrung post, I had to write the hand writing sample in my shag and submit it over to the drunyichemmo. They would check the sample and submit it to the Dalai Lama. The Dalai Lama would check this and give the approval for those who were qualified.   

**Q:** Did you have to do the mibab jenshu after you submitted your writing test?   

**A:** We have to submit our writing sample just before doing the mibab jenshu. The Yigtsang would call those who were selected to be candidates and inform them of the date to come and do the mibab jenshu. On that day, you had to wear monks' robes and go there.   

**Q:** At that time, since Reting was the regent, you had to do the mibab jenshu before the Regent, right?   

**A:** You are right. We all had to stand there and the regent looked at us and then he would go in would give the names of those he approved. After that, we had to go to Yigtsang where they would read the names of those who got approved to be a tsidrung. The rest of them had to go home.   

**Q:** Those who didn't get the chance to be a tsidrung would they then get another chance in the future?   

**A:**  Yes. They would get a chance sooner or later.   

**Q:** When you applied to be tsidrung, were you [a student] in the Tse labdra or not?   

**A:**  I had already graduated from the Tse labdra.   

**Q:** How long were you in the Tse labdra?   

**A:**  I stayed in the school for one and half years. I didn't have to stay in the Tse labdra long because I had already studied in the school in Lhasa where I had learned writing and reading.   

**Q:** After that, what did you do?   

**A:** After I became a tsidrung, for 3-4 months I just had to attend the drungja. I didn't have any other work. After 3-4 months, I worked as a staff official [Tib. las bya] in the Yigtsang and had to write edicts and whatever was needed. I worked there for several years.   

**Q:** At that time, did you get a salary?   

**A:** No, we didn't get a salary. [laughs].   

**Q:** So how did you make your living?   

**A:** I had to find my living by myself.   

**Q:** At that time, your livelihood was being taken care of by your family, right?   

**A:** Yes. We ate at home.   

**Q:** You were living with your family, right?   

**A:**  Yes. I was staying at home with my family.   

**Q:** You worked as a staff officer for two years and then what did you do after that?   

**A:**  Some of the tsidrung would get a chance to go to a dzong and/or shiga. After that, they appointed me as caretaker of the golden stupa [Tib. gser sdong] called Phende Wömba [Tib. phan bde 'od 'bar] [where the remains of the Dalai Lama was kept.]   

**Q:** Which golden stupa was that?   

**A:** I was the caretaker of the golden stupa known as Phende Wömba.   

**Q:** Which Dalai Lama's golden stupa was that?   

**A:** That golden stupa is located on the north side of the golden stupa called Dzamling Gyenjig [Tib. 'dzam gling rgyan gcig].   

**Q:** For being a caretaker, was there any salary?   

**A:**  No. I didn't get a salary.   

**Q:** But you would get more income than working as a staff officer, right?   

**A:** No. There was nothing when I worked as a caretaker for a few years.   

**Q:** After you became a tsidrung, you worked for a few years in the Yigtsang and after that you worked as a caretaker. Did you have any connections with (Drepung's) Loseling [Tib. blo gsal gling] College. For example, did you have to supply things for the donggo ritual in the monastery?   

**A:** No. I didn't have to perform the donggo ritual in the monastery.   

**Q:** But normally you would get a share of the (monks') salary and alms from the tratsang, right?   

**A:** The tratsang would not give me a share of the salary and alms, but the khamtsen would give me a share of the alms and salary.   

**Q:** In which khamtsen were you in?   

**A:** I was in Gyerong Khamtsen [Tib. rgyal rong khang tshan]. My name is registered in the list of the khamtsen members, so they gave me the alms and salary.   

**Q:** Why didn't you get a share of alms and salary from the tratsang?   

**A:** I didn't get any share from the tratsang.   

**Q:** You got a share from the khamtsen after you became the tsidrung but you didn't get a share before that, right?   

**A:**  Yes. I didn't get a share before I became a tsidrung.   

**Q:** You would not get a share from the tratsang unless you became a tratsang chöndze, right?   

**A:** Yes. I performed [funded] the donggo in the khamtsen to become a khamtsen chöndze because I wouldn't have been able to do the shöndre.   

**Q:** Did you supply the donggo for the chöndze when you first joined the monastery.   

**A:** Yes.   

**Q:**  You were not a chöndze of the tratsang, right?   

**A:**  Yes. The tratsang chöndze is higher than the khamtsen chöndze.   

**Q:** After you became a tsidrung, you only got shares from the khamtsen and you didn't get shares from the tratsang, right?   

**A:** Yes. I only got shares from the khamtsen.   

**Q:** Usually, or sometimes, would you go to the monastery?   

**A:** If I had something to do, I would go to the monastery.   

**Q:** What kind of work did you do after you became the caretaker of the golden stupa?   

**A:**  After that, since I was an ordinary tsidrung, it was hard to earn a living. So I went with Lhalu [Tib. lha klu] [the Dome jigyab] to Chamdo as [part of] his staff.   

**Q:** How long did you stay in Dome [Kham]?   

**A:** I stayed there for 4-5 years.   

**Q:**  That was just before the Chinese came to Tibet, right?   

**A:** Yes. That was in 1947-48, just before the Chinese came.   

**Q:**  At that time, how many tsidrung and how many lay officials were there with Lhalu?   

**A:** We had 5 tsidrung and there were more lay officials, like the gadrung and the gandrön in the Kashag. In Chamdo, I was only writing things for the Kashag and I didn't have any other work.   

**Q:** After you came to Chamdo, did you get a salary or did you get a thabden?   

**A:**  No. They would send us to work as a tsasho in places like Markham [Tib. smar khams], Lhodzong [Tib. lho rdzong], and Derge [Tib. sde dge] Dzongs, and to Derge Kamthog [Tib. skam thog].   

**Q:** The tsasho is not the dzongpön, right?   

**A:** Yes. The tsasho is only for collecting the salt taxes and other trade taxes. It was not a dzongpön.   

**Q:** Did you become the wool tax collector?   

**A:** No. I collected both the salt taxes and the trade taxes [Tib. tshong khral].   

**Q:** From that there was a little bit income, right?   

**A:** Yes. There was a little bit of income and we didn't have any salary.   

**Q:** Later, the dzong and the shiga were managed by the government and they paid salary to the dzongpön, right?   

**A:** Yes. That was just before the Chinese came to Tibet. At that time, we, the ordinary tsidrung, would get 120 khe of grain per year. [Note that system was actually started in 1956.]  

**Q:** Wasn't that was after they set up the Legjö or Reform Office?   

**A:** Yes. They said that they would pay the salary, but they said we have to go to Lhoka to get it. Anyway, we didn't get much salary in our hands. We just sold the authorization paper to collect salary from high ranking people and from doing that we got a little bit of money from them, and we made our living like this. After the Granary Office [Tib. 'bru khang las khungs] was set up, I got a salary payment only once, although it had been many years since it was decided to pay the salaries.   

**Q:**  When Ngabö went to Chamdo and Lhalu came back to Lhasa, were you with Lhalu or did you have to stay in Chamdo?   

**A:**  Lhalu left us in Chamdo. When Ngabö came to Chamdo, Lhalu threw a party. After that, Lhalu went back right away and he didn't even stay for one day.   

**Q:** Did the Chinese arrest you in Chamdo?   

**A:** Yes, they arrested us in Chamdo and they robbed our property. After that, we came back to Lhasa by foot, walking.   

**Q:** Ngabö had all the staff's officers with him, right?   

**A:** No. Ngabö was told to keep all of Lhalu's staff officers who were in Chamdo.   

**Q:**  I heard that after you people passed over a pass called Lagong La [Tib. la gong la], the Chinese arrived there and you were unable to go (past that place), is that right?   

**A:**  Yes, when Ngabö and other people ran away and when they were going down from the Namtso [Tib. gnam mtsho] Mountain Pass, the Chinese surrounded the mountain and they couldn't get through.   

**Q:** I heard that Depön Muja [Tib. mu bya] said if we had fought with the Chinese, then we would have been able to get through, right?   

**A:**  He just said that verbally, but he didn't fire a single shot. Before the Chinese came, he had already left for somewhere. This was said by his soldiers.   

**Q:** Did he run away?   

**A:** Yes, he ran away to Chamdo.   

**Q:** When did you come to Lhasa?   

**A:** I came to Lhasa slowly after the Chinese came up to Lhasa.   

**Q:** When did you arrive in Lhasa?   

**A:** I think I came to Lhasa in 1950. I came slowly, like on a pilgrimage.   

**Q:** Did you have a very hard time?   

**A:** Yes. Nobody took care of me.   

**Q:** All of your belongings were taken away, right?   

**A:** The weapons and the animals were taken by the Chinese. Other better belongings were taken by the Khambas in the lodging inns where we stayed. At that time, we were just thinking how we could run away and we didn't have any idea of taking care of our things.   

**Q:** When you came to Lhasa, did you work again as a government official?   

**A:** When we came to Lhasa we had to report our arrival [Tib. 'byor phyag] to the superiors and had to attend the ceremonies because we were still shungshab. But at that time, the Dalai Lama was not in Lhasa, and all the officials were kind of new and the situation was in a kind of chaos.   

**Q:** He went to Yadong, right?   

**A:** Yes. The situation was disturbed. Among us, some people like Muja and Karchungwa [Tib. dkar byung ba] went to visit the officials when they were at home, so they got jobs (positions). But we didn't get anything.   

**Q:** So what did you do during that period?   

**A:** I just stayed in between [work] for awhile. Later when the Preparatory Committee of the TAR [abbreviation = PCTAR] was set up, since I knew some oil printing before that, the TAR told the Yigtsang to send me to work for them. So I was sent there [to] do the printing and I finally got a job.   

**Q:** At that time, they would pay you dayan for your salary, right?   

**A:** I got about 70 dayan.   

**Q:** Was that per month?   

**A:** Yes.   

**Q:**  I don't understand who set up the Preparatory Committee? Did the Chinese set that up or was it dewashung?   

**A:**  The Preparatory Committee was set up jointly by the dewashung and the Chinese through discussions. In it, there were half Tibetans and half Chinese.   

**Q:** So you worked in there until 1959?   

**A:** I worked there until the revolt in 1959. I did printing. Usually I would work until noon and then I would go home.   

**Q:**  At that time, you were playing mahjong, right?   

**A:** Yes, I would play mahjong and just hang around.   

**Q:** Did you do any business/trading?   

**A:** No. Let alone doing business, it was hard for me to get food then because I didn't have anything. After we left Chamdo we were arrested and when we were released from the prison, I only had my bedding and a cushion.   

**Q:** You were a prisoner in 1959, right?   

**A:** At the time of [the] revolt, we didn't stay in the PCTAR but we went to protect the Jokhang, so I was arrested.   

**Q:** So the Chinese considered that you were involved in the revolt?   

**A:** Yes, they said that we were reactionaries and shut us up in prison.   

**Q:**  At first, where did they lock you up?   

**A:** At first I was arrested and locked up in Taring [Tib. phreng ring] Prison. From Taring, I was sent to Bari [Tib. brag ri] Hermitage to work as a cook for some prisoners who were working there.   

**Q:**  Altogether, how long did you stay in the prison?   

**A:**  I was in prison from 1959 until December 1981. I stayed in prison for 22 years. At first they told us, "You should work hard and you will get released soon, at the time of [the] first of October [Ch. shi yi] [holiday]." After that, they were saying, "You will be released on the first of May [Ch. wu yi]." So they just pushed back the date like that.   

**Q:** When you were in Lhasa in [the] 1950s, did you have any contact with the [Drepung] monastery?   

**A:** No. I didn't have any contact with the monastery.   

**Q:** So you just had the name that you had joined the monastery, right?   

**A:** Yes. It was just in name only.   

**Q:** Were most of the tsidrung like you, that is people who just joined the monastery in name only, but they didn't stay in the monastery?   

**A:** Yes. They all were the same as me, and they didn't stay in the monastery.   

**Q:** Monks have great loyalty to their tratsang. Did you have loyalty like this to your tratsang?   

**A:**  In the monastery, the monastic officials were very powerful, but we [government monk officials] didn't have any power in the monastery.   

**Q:** Did you have loyalty to your own Loseling Tratsang?   

**A:** When we had a little money, we would perform a donggo in one's own tratsang. When we didn't have money, we wouldn't do it.   

**Q:** Were most of the tsidrung like this?   

**A:** Yes. Some of the tsidrung had good shagtsang. Otherwise, most of the tsidrung were not rich.   

**Q:** In 1950, there were some troubles in the monastery, for example in Gomang College, they had problems and the lagyüba and pechawa got into a fight. Did you and other tsidrung hear about this?   

**A:**  Among us they didn't talk about that because we were separate from the monastery.   

**Q:** Do you know about the dobdo's tobtsang? I heard that the government ordered the tobtsang disbanded. Do you know about that?   

**A:** The tobtsang was not disbanded by the government.   

**Q:** The government didn't disband the dobdo, but when Gomang and Sera Mey were doing the competition where jumping was the main event, chogyag, the government stopped it, is that right?   

**A:** The dobdo had their own kyidu. In the kyidu, they had their seniority. The government didn't stop the tobtsang. What happened was when the Dalai Lama was young, one dobdo had long hair behind his ears which we call dobtra. So the Dalai Lama grabbed his hair because he had the long hair when he was wearing a monk's robe.   

**Q:** Where did that happen?   

**A:** That happened in Potala at an official ceremony. When people were going to seek the audience with the Dalai Lama, he grabbed his hair and asked him, "What is this? This is not good." Since then the monks were not allowed to keep their dobtra.  

**Q:** When did that happen?   

**A:** That was when the Dalai Lama was young.   

**Q:** At that time, had the Chinese come?   

**A:** It was before the Chinese came to Tibet.   

**Q:** Did you hear about them stopping the jumping competition?   

**A:** No. The khamtsen and the tratsang stopped the jumping competition. That was because when they did the jumping competition, the monks were fighting and even killing many people, each other. The khamtsen made some of them to leave [Tib. gtor] the [dobdo] kyidu.   

**Q:** Who stopped the jumping competition first? Did they stop it in Sera monastery?   

**A:** At first Sera stopped it because Sera monks fought the first time in Bontö [Tib. 'brom stod] when Loseling and Sera Jey were doing the jumping competition. It was not kind of playing games because from the beginning they were carrying guns. So later on, the tratsang held a discussion and they decided to stop the jumping competition.   

**Q:** When did they stop the jumping competition? Was that before the Chinese came or after the Chinese came?   

**A:** That was just before the Chinese came.   

**Q:** That was just after the Sera War, right?   

**A:** That was after the Sera War.   

**Q:** When the Chinese came in the 1950's, there were some changes, like setting up offices, like the Legjö Office and the Gyöship Legung Office [Tib. gyod zhib las khungs], which was a branch of the judicial system where civil disputes were settled, etc. At that time, what kind of impression did you people have?   

**A:** At that time, we didn't think about those things much because no one was taking care of us [Tib. bdag po rgyag mkhan med pa] and we didn't have any way to meddle in those matters. So we were just in between, passing our time. If there was a chance to express our opinions, we might have had some opinions, but we didn't have the chance to say anything. So we just regarded whatever they did from above as correct.   

**Q:** In [the] 1950s, even though the Chinese came to Tibet, in the monastery the monks were doing everything the same as before. For example, studying and giving out loans. Everything remained [the] same as before the Chinese came, right?   

**A:** Yes, when the Chinese first came to Tibet, they did very good, and they offered mangja for the monk's [prayer] assembly and they gave alms. So the monks were staying as before doing their studying and nobody was creating disturbances. After 1959, the Chinese said the monks were not allowed to hold the Mönlam Festival and were not allowed to do the Tsongjö Sebang procession that took place on the 30th day of the second lunar month, and they also said that it would not be okay if the monks gathered to do prayer assemblies. Therefore, the monks became mentally against the Chinese and they started causing disturbances.   

**Q:** The monks were not thinking that [the] Chinese would do that, right?   

**A:** Yes, the monks didn't think it would happen like that, and the monks were just studying in their shag and going to the tsog. It just happened all of a sudden.   

**Q:** What did you think when the Preparatory Committee of the TAR was set up? Did you think that [it] was bad or good?   

**A:**  We were saying, "This is not good. And one day they will tighten this like a hat made from wet skin [Tib. ko ba rlon pa'i zhwa mo]. Now it looks nice and they are giving dayan, but later they will make it [policy] tight."   

**Q:** This was commonly said and most of [the] people had that opinion, right?   

**A:** Yes. Most of the people were thinking like that. In the monastery the monks were also saying like that. But at that time, no one was taking care of us. This was just before the revolt. You know the representative of Ganden (Monastery) who has pockmarks on his face? He and some other people were saying at the meeting, "Now, who knows! We don't have any idea. Anyway, I think they [Chinese] are doing to us like putting on us a hat made from wet skin. One day, they will make us suffer like we would have to vomit." The meeting was held in the Potala and they were talking about whether we should fight or not. Some people said that we shouldn't fight with them and we should negotiate with the Chinese. And some of them were saying that we should fight with the Chinese. The heads were just going through the motions of talking to each other, but we, the lower people, didn't meddle into these matters. But we were just saying it was not good that the Chinese had come.   

**Q:** At that time, where were you?   

**A:** Tashi Tsering: At that time I was not in Lhasa. In 1957, I went to Lhasa. The general meeting that he had mentioned might [have been] in 1958.   

**Q:** At the time of mimang tshogpa, were you in Lhasa?   

**A:** Tashi Tsering: I was in Lhasa. I had been a gadrukpa and a clerk of the tseja office, so we had to go to serve tea at tsondu gyendzom meetings.   

**Q:** Did you hear about the mimang tshogpa?   

**A:** Tashi Tsering: I also took a khata and an envelope with some money and went to see Alo Chöndze when he was detained in the Tromsikang Police Station.   

**Q:** At that time, in the Mönlam, someone threw posters, right?   

**A:** No. That was different. The poster thrown in Mönlam was to request the umdze to start the prayer. [He misunderstood the question.]  

**Q:** Tashi Tsering: Probably not. Anyway, at that time Alo Chöndze, Bisu Jola [Tib. spel zur jo lags] and the Ganden monk with the goiter were said to be representatives of the people and they did something. This was in 1951, right? [No. It was in 1956.]  

**A:** Yes, that was earlier.
