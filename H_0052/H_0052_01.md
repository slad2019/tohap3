**Q:**  When Reting [Tib. rwa sgreng] took political power as the Regent, you might have been in your 20's, right?   

**A:**  I was probably 23 or 24 years old.   

**Q:**  Do you remember those events?   

**A:**  I don't remember them very well because I was always staying at home. I was engrossed in domestic affairs. I swear by the Three Jewels that I was not attentive to external affairs. Furthermore, at that time, my husband (Yuthok) and I had 5 children. Also, there were many people coming to our house because Kungö [she uses the honorific term for her husband rather than his name] was good, and he was fond of meeting people [Tib. mi dad chen po]. I served all of them well. There were people coming for the entire day, so I didn't know happened outside. However, I will tell you whatever I know.   

**Q:**  When Reting Rimpoche was the Regent, were you in Lhasa?   

**A:**  Yes.   

**Q:**  How did they confirm Reting as the Regent? How did you hear about this?   

**A:**  I don't have much to tell you about this. Probably, he was unanimously confirmed as the Regent. Most people had deep faith in Reting because he was an authentic reincarnation [Tib. yang srid 'phrul bral].   

**Q:**  Yes, it was said that he was an authentic reincarnation - that he tied up the mouth of a clay pot and he also stuck a peg into a rock and left his footprint on the rock, right?   

**A:**  Yes. I also heard that when Reting Rimpoche was sitting as a child at night, there was a fire burning and shining around him.   

**Q:**  When you got married, had the 13th Dalai Lama already passed away?   

**A:**  I got married two months after the Dalai Lama passed away. Before the Dalai Lama passed away, Kungö used to come to our house many times. I got married on the 2nd of the 1st month and the Dalai Lama passed away in the 10th month of the previous year.   

**Q:**  He passed away on the 30th of the 10th month, right?   

**A:**  Yes. Therefore my marriage ceremony was not that elaborate.   

**Q:**  At that time, Yuthok was the depön [Tib. mda' dpon] (Commander) of the Drongdrag [Tib. grong drag] Regiment, and there was trouble in the regiment. So did he talk about that, saying things like, "Oh! My God! There is so much trouble!"? Do you remember anything about that?   

**A:**  At that time there was trouble in the Drongdrag Regiment, but they just let Kungö go kind of gradually [Tib. shud shud la]. When he came to our house, even though he was the depön, he didn't have to attend any meetings with the soldiers. So probably, at that time, they were letting him go gradually.   

**Q:**  Do you remember when the Drongdrag soldiers rushed out [Tib. lug] one night?   

**A:**  Yes, they did. But I don't remember what happened on that particular night. If you ask Taring [Tib. phreng ring], he knows a lot about this because he was the junior depön and he was there to experience that.   

**Q:**  At that time, did Yuthok talk about that and say that they were great or that those people caused trouble? Did you have this kind of conversation with him? Or did he not talk about that at all?   

**A:**  Usually, when Kungö [Yuthok] came, he would talk with my older brother and we were not involved much in those talks. So we didn't converse much about those things. He would come to our house and stay for 1-2 days, and we would not talk much at night, right? Probably, he talked with my older brother a lot because they were friends.   

**Q:**  Did you remember anything about the Lungshar [Tib. lung shar] incident?   

**A:**  I don't remember much about those events, but I heard that Lungshar was shut in. I didn't know about their secret relations.   

**Q:**  At that time, Lungshar became very famous. He had a kind of party, right?   

**A:**  Yes, one of the reasons why Lungshar became famous was that he investigated twice the land (estates) of aristocrats [Tib. sa zhib] and the taxes they were supposed to be levied.   

**Q:**  This was the investigation on the newly opened fields and the newly levied taxes were called babshi, right?   

**A:**  Oh! Yes, at that time, there was a sawang working with Lungshar.   

**Q:**  Was there a Sawang also?   

**A:**  Yes, probably. Wasn't he from Jamyangkyil [Tib. 'jam dbyangs dkyil]. They had two brothers; one was called Chödarla [Tib. chos dar lags] and other was called Tenkyongla [Tib. bstan skyong lags].   

**Q:**  Chödarla was from Kundeling [Tib. kun bde gling], right? I don't know in detail about Tenkyong la, but he was from Jamyangkyil, right?   

**A:**  Probably he was the Sawang.   

**Q:**  Oh! I see. At that time, they had a joint committee called Drungtsi Sungdrel [Tib. drung rtsis zung sbrel] that brought together the heads of the Ecclesiastical Office, the drunyichemmo, and the heads of the Revenue Office [Tib. tsipön], right?   

**A:**  Yes, at that time, Lungshar became famous when he levied high taxes on some estates and he gave exemptions on some others.   

**Q:**  Normally taxes were levied on the taxable land (Tib. treshing [khral zhing]). How did he levy the taxes when he did the investigation? Did he levy the taxes on the treshing?   

**A:**  For example, he investigated how much land Surkhang had. We told him that these estates were for serving as the government officials. We had a very big estate called Kalung on which he levied a new tax of 10 dotse [1 dotse = 500 srang]. Probably, Lungshar was helping [Tib. skyabs 'jug 'dzin pa] Surkhang [since that was not a large amount]. This 10 dotse went to one of the Babshi Offices of the government.   

**Q:**  Was that like an income tax?   

**A:**  Yes, it was like an income tax.   

**Q:**  Did the household (Surkhang) pay the 10 dotse, or was it collected from the miser?   

**A:**  The household paid that. I heard from my mother saying that we paid 10 dotse.   

**Q:**  Were you related to Lungshar?   

**A:**  No, he was nothing to us, but at that time, though my brother was young, people might have a great hope in him and my brother was very tactful in speaking with people. So Surkhang was levied just a small amount of taxes [by Lungshar].   

**Q:**  Do you remember anything or did you hear about the Loseling College incident when the manager, Tshachag [Tib. tsha phyag], prostrated in front of the Dalai Lama and submitted a petition [Tib. phyag 'tshal brgyab]. It was said that Shölkang [Tib. zhol khang] sent them [to do that], right?   

**A:**  I don't remember anything about that. I just heard later that the monks said that they are going to prostrate to submit a petition, but actually they urinated on the stage in Norbulinga.   

**Q:**  Did you know the reason why the monks were agitated?   

**A:**  I don't have much to tell you about this. Probably, there was a small reason for that.   

**Q:**  We don't know the reason why the monks came along, right?   

**A:**  Probably, Kungö Lobsang Gyentsen [Tib. blo bzang rgyal mtshan] might know about this because he was a monk. He is staying in Nepal. Kundeling Kungö might also know about this. Lobsang Gyentsen might know more because he was older and he was from the monk household of the Sawang Tenkyongla. Are you Mella familiar with him? [Gelek] Rimpoche must be familiar with him. You should ask him.   

**Q:**  After the Loseling trouble, there was the trouble of the military officers [Tib. drag po'i dpon po], right?   

**A:**  Regarding the trouble of the military officers, Tsarong Sawangchemmo and my father, and Tsögo [Tib. mtsho sgo], Salungwa [Tib. sa lung ba], Nyelungwa [Tib. snye lung ba] and probably Trendong [Tib. 'phreng gdong] was also involved. There was also Netö [Tib. sne stod].   

**Q:**  How did the trouble of the military officers happen?   

**A:**  The people who liked [Tib. mos pa] the work line of Tsarong were the military officers. My father liked Tsarong Sawangchemmo very much and Tsarong also liked him. All of them liked Tsarong. Mrs. Taring will have the details about this. One day Tsarong went to a party given at the house of the Queen of Derge (Tib. Derge Tsünmo [sde dge btsun mo]). While his soldiers were staying idle, the soldiers got into fight in Yamon and people rushed hither and thither and Sawangchemmo was called there because he was the commander in chief [Tib. magji]. On that day, probably, one person became handicapped [Tsarong cut off his hand]. I didn't know for sure. I just heard about this.  Probably, Lungshar might have told the previous Dalai Lama about this because of his dislike of Tsarong. I heard that the Dalai Lama was very agitated with Tsarong from that day on. When that happened, [diminished favor] to Sawangchemmo [Tsarong], it happened the same to his followers and all of them were diminished in favor [Tib. nyams nyes]. They were not diminished all in one day, but all of them were demoted one after another. Oh My god! my father was also demoted to the status of an ordinary lay official.  He was demoted for a small matter. Later on I heard about that. When my father was the depön of the Bodyguard Regiment of the Dalai Lama, there was a young boy trained for copying government documents (Tib. itrug [e phrug]) who was from Nyemo Jünba [Tib. snye mo 'jun pa]. Probably, my father tried to [have sex] [Tib. tshad tshad gnang] with the wife of the young boy.   

**Q:**  Was that the girl nicknamed, "Balloon Brand" [Tib. sgang sbug lan par]?   

**A:**  No. Because he tried that with the wife, her husband got angry and probably he verbally fought with my father. At that time, there were some people at the lower level who reported this matter to the Private Office [Tib. nang ma sgang] of the Dalai Lama saying that Surkhang did this. This was the reason why my father got demoted. He was told that it was because he played with another person's wife.  Then my father was just an ordinary lay official [Tib. drung 'khor dkyus ma]. Usually, he wore a golden head ornament [box] called gao on his head knot [Tib. spa lcog] and a yellow brocade dress. On that day when he came back he was wearing a type of dress called Tsechuma [Tib. tshal phyu ma] that had a collar and openings on both sides. and his golden head ornament was also removed. So at that time, people were kind of old-fashioned and my mother burst into tears. We also didn't dare to look at my father's head. So that was how they demoted the officials. It was kind of shameful. From the next day people came to say sorry and they offered money in envelopes as their condolences [Tib. thugs gsos]. Although I was a child, I heard them talking about that, but I didn't want to listen to them. Probably, I was 13-14 years old. I sat near the wool workers and just worked with them and didn't show my face to the people who came to offer condolences. Even though I was a child, I didn't want to look at them.   

**Q:**  Didn't the military officers gather together and do something?   

**A:**  Probably, they didn't do anything. If they did something, I didn't know about it.   

**Q:**  There was a talk about sending the military officers to a meeting.   

**A:**  Probably, they must have done something. Anyway, the power was on the side of Tsarong Sawangchemmo.   

**Q:**  After Surkhang was demoted, how did he get to go to Kham?   

**A:**  My parents didn't get along well because of a bad cause. Once, on the 2nd day of the Tibetan New Year, there were people throwing a kind of fire cracker from our house and the people going in the street would also throw fire crackers upwards to our house. At that time, father was wearing a brocade fur dress and he had kept this much firecrackers in his pouch and he was throwing the firecrackers on the people who were passing by. His sons were also there. Then when somebody threw up a firecracker, it entered his pouch and the other fire crackers exploded. So he took them with his hand and his arm got burnt and it became like a chicken whose skin was peeled off. At that time, someone we knew who was called the "translator" [Tib. yig sgyur] gave him this [opium] saying that it would relieve the pain. So my father started to take that. At that time there was a person called Koko Dawa [Ch. ge ge, Tib. zla ba]. Chundenla's mother also knew him. He might not been using it himself, but he knew somebody who was familiar with [opium] and they gave it to him. After that my father would say that he is going for circumambulation around Lhasa and he would come back late. Actually, he was going to have that. Therefore, he didn't get along well with my mother. But since it was just an internal matter, my mother didn't say anything. Later, the Dalai Lama inquired about this and said, "Nowadays, the Surkhang family probably is not getting along well." At that time, Tsarong Sawangchemmo mediated between them to make them get along well, but, they didn't agree to the mediation. At that time, my mother used to tell the two of us, the daughters, "Let's separate from Surkhang. We will get one estate as our share." That was all that would happen if a woman didn't get along well. My mother wanted to go out [of the marriage and family] with an estate taking her two daughters. The Lord Chamberlain then was named Data [Tib. zla rta], but was also nicknamed, "face hairy" (Tib. abso [ab sog]). The Dalai Lama inquired through the Lord Chamberlain and he asked my mother if she was not getting along well. She said, "Yes, we are not getting along well, but this is just a matter between the couple." When he asked my father, he also said the same that it was just a matter between the couple. But then the Dalai Lama issued a edict saying, "If you are not getting along well, the mother should stay in Surkhang." At that time, the son, Wangchen Gelek [Tib. dbang chen dge legs] was a student in the lay official's training school [Tib. rtsis phrug pa] that was held in the Revenue Office [Tib. tsikhang] in the name of the Treshong estate [Tib. bkras gshongs]. The Dalai Lama said, "Wangchen Gelek should become a lay official right away and does not have to wait to do it at the Festivals [Tib. mdzad chen stabs bstun]. Surkhang should manage the Treshong Estate. Father should go separately and the Surkhang family should pay him a salary and a share." All of us were worried saying what shall we do if father has to separate. Then my father asked for lodging in Horkhang [an aristocratic family]. After that, my mother told my older brother that he should give Father whatever he wanted. Then my father was appointed as the Jadang [Tib. ja dang] Regiment's depön.   

**Q:**  Did your father got separated after he was demoted or before?   

**A:**  It was before that. He was already demoted and all of us cried. At that time, there wasn't any unfriendly relations. Because he didn't have work, he threw the fire crackers when he was a ordinary lay official.   

**Q:**  Was he appointed as the Jadang Depön or was he was the Tog Magpön [Tib. tog ? dmag dpon]?   

**A:**  No. He was the Jadang Depön. Then he got the golden head ornament (gao) again.   

**Q:**  Did he get it in Lhasa?   

**A:**  Yes.   

**Q:**  He was the depön in Lhasa and he went to Kham, right?   

**A:**  He went to Kham as the Jadang Depön and he stayed in Kham. While there he got together with Jigmela's [Tib. 'jigs med lags] mother and she gave birth to him and after that she died. I was about 18 years old at that time and I was staying at home. After that, my father got the third rank position of Dzasa [Tib. dza sag]. My father was very capable, even though he was smoking (opium). He sent Jigmela to school and he built his house and made arrangements for taking Tsarong's daughter as his bride.   

**Q:**  Which of Tsarong's daughter did he arrange to take for Jigmela?   

**A:**  It was Thondrub Drolma [Tib. don grub sgrol ma] who later became Shölkang Jedrung's [Tib. zhol khang rje drung] wife. My father also did the engagement.   

**Q:**  What happened?   

**A:**  Later, everything broke up [Tib. khru slog] when the lady of Wubug Gyatso [Tib. 'od phug rgya mtsho] became my father's wife. A lot of things happened after that.   

**Q:**  How did it happen?   

**A:**  Probably, it is unnecessary to say here.   

**Q:**  When your father went to Kham, was it the time of Reting Regent or the Dalai Lama?   

**A:**  The Dalai Lama had passed away. The Dalai Lama passed away when I was 22 years old. The 13th Dalai Lama passed away just before I went to Yuthok [s a bride].   

**Q:**  This was in 1933, right?   

**A:**  Yes.   

**Q:**  At that time, your father Sursur [Tib. zur zur] was in Kham, right?   

**A:**  Yes, after he arrived at Kham, he got promoted to be the Governor of Kham (Tib. Doji Dzasa [Tib. mdo spyi dza sag]) through an edict.   

**Q:**  That was the time of Reting, right?   

**A:**  Yes.   

**Q:**  He was promoted to be the Governor of Kham from being the Jadang Depön, right?   

**A:**  Yes. At that time the position of Governor was a joint position [Tib. zung sbrel] with y father and the monk official Khyenrab Palden [Tib. mkhyen rab dpal ldan].   

**Q:**  When the 13th Dalai Lama died, one of the powerful persons was Trimön [Tib. khri smon], right?   

**A:**  Yes.   

**Q:**  After 1-2 years, all of a sudden Trimön resigned, right?   

**A:**  Yes.   

**Q:**  Did you know anything about the reason for this?   

**A:**  I don't remember clearly, but what I heard from people was that Trimön was a very smart person and before those things happened, he went to the hermitages and he also went in the Barkor Street wearing a white skirt. Then he resigned all of a sudden and he went to Drepung for a time.   

**Q:**  Why did he go to Drepung?   

**A:**  To avoid a kind of danger.   

**Q:**  No. This was before that, it was when the Lungshar incident happened.   

**A:**  Was it at that time?   

**Q:**  Probably, it was at that time.   

**A:**  They took out the eyeballs of Lungshar after the Dalai Lama passed away.   

**Q:**  At that time, probably Trimön was acting like a crazy person [Tib. smyo 'cham skyon].   

**A:**  Anyway, Trimön was a knowledgeable [Tib. dgongs pa chen po] person.   

**Q:**  Do you think that Trimön didn't become insane [Tib. thugs sems mi bde ba]?   

**A:**  Yes, I think so. He just [deliberately] gave the appearance that he had become kind of insane or crazy [Tib. 'chal le 'chol le].   

**Q:**  The reason for him doing that was because there was a danger that he might get demoted, right?   

**A:**  Not really getting demoted, but he was afraid because Lungshar's eyeballs were taken out.   

**Q:**  Why would he be afraid because Lungshar's eyeballs were taken out?   

**A:**  Trimön did that [took out Lungshar's eyeballs]. At that time there were many cruel punishments.   

**Q:**  He was afraid of getting arrested, right?   

**A:**  Yes.   

**Q:**  That was really strange. He thought that if he would stay like this for a long time, he might get into trouble, so he voluntarily resigned, right?   

**A:**  Yes.   

**Q:**  If this was the case, why did he try to become a Shape [Tib. zhabs pad] again during the time of the Regent Taktra [Tib. stag brag]?   

**A:**  Yes. Later he was a Shape, right?   

**Q:**  He didn't become a Shape. He tried to become a Shape and said that he will offer the Tashiling [Tib. bkra shis gling] Estate as a bribe to the Regent Taktra.   

**A:**  I didn't know about this.   

**Q:**  When Lungshar had the trouble, Trimön went to Drepung. Do you remember anything about this?   

**A:**  I don't remember much. I just heard that he ran away to Drepung.   

**Q:**  At that time, did the people in Lhasa think that what Lungshar did was good and beneficial for the state and the people, or did the people think that what he did was for himself to become a king?   

**A:**  At that time, the people who knew the situation were saying that Lungshar was good. But most people were saying that what he did was for himself to become a person with high position [Tib. chen po]. It was kind of half and half. Half of the people liked him and the other half didn't like him. Right after Lungshar's eyeballs were taken out, all people liked him and said it's a pity [Tib. snying rje]. Right after this, everyone stood on the side of Lungshar and people were saying that if what Lungshar did had worked out, it would be good and the Chinese would not have been able to do such things after they came to Tibet.   

**Q:**  Who said that?   

**A:**  Many people of the masses told me this.   

**Q:**  After Lungshar was demoted and Trimön resigned, another big trouble occurred when Yabshi Langdün [Tib. yab gzhis glang mdun] resigned from the Prime Minister position [Tib. srid blon], right?   

**A:**  I heard this was caused by the tactics [Tib. 'phrul] of Reting   

**Q:**  What do you mean by tactics here?   

**A:**  I mean Reting didn't like him.   

**Q:**  Why didn't he like him?   

**A:**  I didn't know the reason for that. Langdün was a very nice person and his character [Tib. thugs rgyu] was good and he was a humble person.   

**Q:**  Yes, all the people were saying that he was very humble. Anyway, probably, it was not okay for Reting to have a partner, right?   

**A:**  Probably.   

**Q:**  Otherwise, he didn't need to resign because probably he was doing whatever Reting told him to do, right?   

**A:**  Yes. But Reting saw that there was a problem if he was there when he [Reting] was doing something crooked [Tib. kyog kyog]. Probably Langdün would not follow him, because Langdün was always going straight and not doing crooked things.   

**Q:**  At that time, Yuthok was there, right?   

**A:**  Well, at the beginning, Kungö was the depön of the Bodyguard Regiment (Tib. gusung depön [sku srung mda' dpon]).   

**Q:**  No, he was in the Drongdrag Regiment at the beginning, and later he went to the Bodyguard Regiment.   

**A:**  Yes, when he was transferred to the Bodyguard Regiment, he didn't need to hold the ceremony for getting appointed [Tib. gsar mjal]. At that time, I was familiar with that. He just received the appointment order [Tib. bka' sgyur] and offered the order Khata [Tib. bka' sgyur mjal dar] and that was all. He worked many years as the gusung depön.   

**Q:**  What was the reason for him to get the third rank position of Theiji?   

**A:**  They wanted to appoint my maternal uncle Somphü [Tib. gzom phud] as the gusung depön, so Kungö [Yuthok] was promoted to the Theiji rank and Somphü was appointed as the gusung depön. Those two orders were given at the same time. He [Kungö] was kind of expelled [Tib. phud pa].   

**Q:**  At that time, could he say, "I don't want the Theiji rank"?   

**A:**  No, he couldn't. He just had to say, "As you say."   

**Q:**  Where was your brother Sawangchemmo at that time?   

**A:**  He was in Kham. I heard that he had become the depön of the Trapchi Regiment, but I am not sure about that. After that, my brother was also transferred and his replacement was Jagdrag [Tib. lcags sprag].   

**Q:**  Was he the father of Paljorla [Tib. dpal 'byor lags]?   

**A:**  Yes. Later my brother became a fourth rank Rimshi [Tib. rim bzhi] Official and was on the staff of my father. Anyway, at that time, two bad things happened, though they were not that bad.   

**Q:**  After that, your brother was appointed as the Head of the Palanquin Carriers of the Dalai Lama (Tib. phebjam gopa [phebs byams 'go pa]), right?   

**A:**  Yes. Then he came up [back from Kham].   

**Q:**  Did he get transferred?   

**A:**  No. It was kind of a vacation [Tib. gzhis skor] and then probably [while back in Lhasa] he was appointed as the Phebjam Gopa.   

**Q:**  After that, he didn't need to go down [to Kham], right?   

**A:**  Yes. Probably when my father came up [from Kham], my brother also came up. When the Doji came back, his staff also had to come back.   

**Q:**  When did your father finish his term as the Governor of Kham?   

**A:**  When Nangchunwa [Tib. gnang byung ba] came to Kham as his replacement, he came back.   

**Q:**  What was the cause of that [coming back]?   

**A:**  The Doji's term was 3 years, so they were replaced after 3 years. After that a real kalön came as the Doji.   

**Q:**  Why did a real kalön come after that?   

**A:**  Probably it was not convenient [Tib. thugs stabs ma 'grig] for them to send a real kalön earlier, so two Dzasa were sent as the Doji.   

**Q:**  After that, your brother came back, right?   

**A:**  Yes. He worked as the Phebjam Gopa for many years.   

**Q:**  Did your father remain as a Dzasa after that?   

**A:**  Yes. He was the Dzasa in charge of the Foreign Office (Tib. chigye legung [Tib. phyi rgyal las khungs]).   

**Q:**  Was that right after he came back?   

**A:**  Not really right after that. He remained as a Dzasa without work for a awhile, and then he was appointed as the Head of the Foreign Office. At that time, his colleague was the Sawang Liushar [Tib. sa dbang sne'u shar].   

**Q:**  At that time, a lot of strange things happened like the Langdün event and then Trekhang Kalön Lama [Tib. bkras khang bka' blon bla ma] also resigned, right?   

**A:**  Probably that happened at the same time as the Trimön incident.   

**Q:**  After he resigned, Temba Jamyang [Tib. bstan pa 'jam dbyangs] was the Kalön Lama. At that time the situation was kind of strange with some people being pulled up and some people being pushed down. What were the aristocrats saying about that? Were they saying that it was good or bad?   

**A:**  Even if people thought something about that, they wouldn't dare to tell it to Reting. Although Reting Rimpoche was good, there were many servants and they stirred up trouble hither and thither [Tib. phar tshur dkrog].   

**Q:**  But Reting himself did those things, right?   

**A:**  Yes. They were done by Reting, but...   

**Q:**  But the servants got blamed. Later, we heard that although Reting was knowledgeable, he was kind of active [Tib. 'khrug po] in playing games and flying kites.   

**A:**  Yes, there were people who accompanied him and helped him pass the time [Tib. dbu 'khor zhu mkhan] like the person called, "crazy Dinkhang." [Tib. lding khang smyon pa]. Reting Rimpoche was fond of him.   

**Q:**  And there was also Phünkang Jedrung la [Tib. phun khang rje drung lags], right? Those people were different [Tib. khag khag].   

**A:**  Yes. They were different. The person I mentioned above was just someone to help him pass the time and he was a person who just talked many different things and didn't use honorific terms and verbally fought with people. Do you remember him?   

**A:**  Gelek: No, I don't remember him.   

**A:**  He used to come to our house and he also came to Yuthok's house wearing some worn out clothing. And there was also the person called Agu Tönpa [Tib. a khu ston pa] who served Reting by singing opera songs. I don't know much about him. He also helped Reting to pass the time.   

**Q:**  The 13th Dalai Lama gave much many emphasis to the development of the army and economic management. But at the time of the Reting, he was not that attentive to such matters, e.g., the economic management. So were the people in Lhasa were also not attentive and just fooling around, or were they worried thinking that there would be some kind of problem later?   

**A:**  Just a few thoughtful people were worried about that.   

**Q:**  Did you ever talk about that at home saying if we aren't be careful, something would happen?   

**A:**  Yes. Yes, my late mother used to tell me, "In the past, the Dalai Lama was trying to set up many new schools and to get medical treatment for the people and when people cultivated new fields, he exempted these from taxes. Now all of these no longer exist and it is like the proverb, "Make the old man fall down and make the old woman stand up." [Tib. spo bo sgyel rmo bo bslangs], they were pulling up some people and making some people to fall. So what shall we do?" Just a few people were talking like this. But probably, most of the people were not that thoughtful.  In the past, the former Dalai Lama tried to set up a big school in Jangsebshar [Tib. lcang gseb shar], the park where later the house of the Yabshi [Tib. yab gzhis], the family of the 14th Dalai Lama, was built. At that time there were Chinese there and the school was a Chinese school. So at one time he tried to develop the culture, but all of these didn't work out. I heard at that time that my late uncle who was a Secretary of the Kashag [Tib. gadrung] went to the Chinese place and he knew a little bit of the Chinese language. My uncle used to be attentive to all matters and he went to the Chinese side and was working for both the Tibetans and the Chinese.  After that, the Dalai Lama exempted newly cultivated fields from taxes for 3 years, and he set up a new office called the Agriculture Office [Tib. so nam las khungs]. He also set up the Medical and Astrological Institute, the Mentsigang and he also distributed something at childbirth like what the [pregnant] mother should do and what they should do after giving birth. Probably, there were scriptures from ancient times regarding those things. At that time, the Dalai Lama was not thinking of his own enjoyment, but he was thinking about such matters.   

**Q:**  So the Reting was not thinking in that way, right?   

**A:**  There were some people who were worried about that. But some people were not attentive to that.   

**Q:**  If the aristocrats were not attentive to government affairs, what were they thinking about? Were they thinking about doing business or what? What were they doing to pass their time?   

**A:**  A few of them were doing religious practices, but most of them were working for their own families.   

**Q:**  Like doing business, right?   

**A:**  Yes, some of them were doing business.   

**Q:**  Some of them were playing mahjong, right?   

**A:**  Yes.   

**Q:**  Did you ever think that there would be a danger that the Chinese would come? At the time of the Panchen Rimpoche, people might have been thinking a little bit about that, right?   

**A:**  At that time, all people were thinking that the situation would not be good because there were prophecies from many Lamas. But people never thought that it would be so bad as it is now. People never thought that all of the things would be robbed away in one day. Later on, when the Chinese arrived at Tibet, my brother [Sawangchemmo] was very much worried about that.   

**Q:**  At that time, even if you never thought that it would happen like it did, did you think that the situation might be like when the Ambans came to Tibet?   

**A:**  We thought that it wouldn't be worse than that when they [Chinese] would make us kind of small and leave us there.   

**Q:**  What do you mean small?   

**A:**  I mean we could get some kind of rights and make us kind of humble [Tib. snyom chung]. We never thought that it would happen like this. Probably, my brother was thinking in that way because he had many relations with the outside and he knew the situation. But we were not learned people.   

**Q:**  What did you think when Reting Rimpoche demoted Künsangtse Tsipön [Tib. kun bzang rtse rtsis dpon] from the position of Laja [Tib. bla phyag] during a Shodön Festival? Were you in Lhasa then, and do you remember this?   

**A:**  I was not there. I didn't know the reason. Did you Rimpoche know about that?   

**Q:** 
 I had heard about that. At that time people were kind of surprised when Künsangtse was demoted.   

**A:**  Yes. We were surprised and we also went to offer the condolence gift [Tib. thugs gsos] with a Khata and probably Künsangtse himself was also disappointed. After that, he didn't stay here [in Lhasa] and he went to stay on the [estate] Gungtang [Tib. gung thang] [which was located at the east side of Lhasa]   

**Q:**  Did he move there?   

**A:**  Not really moved there, but mostly he stayed there and didn't show his face.   

**Q:**  Did he stay there until Reting's regency was over?   

**A:**  It was not like that, but most of the time, he stayed in Gungtang and didn't make relations with people.   

**Q:**  How far is it?   

**A:**  It is about 4-5 miles from Lhasa. It was a good estate. It belonged to Künsangtse and there was a good house there. Künsangtse's relative was also related to us. When things happened like this, I also didn't want to talk [to others].   

**Q:**  Künsangtse went there to avoid [meeting people], right?   

**A:**  Yes.   

**Q:**  Was he demoted from the Laja to the status of ordinary lay official?   

**A:**  No, he was demoted both from his job and from status of lay official [Tib. las zhabs chabs cig]. So he had to braid his hair into two braids and wrap them around his head which was called the Kongpo hair style [Tib. kong skra]. There might have been something to blame him for, but probably not much.   

**Q:**  They replaced him with Joktre [Tib. lcog bkras], who was one of the Reting's followers, right?   

**A:**  Yes, this was also like the proverb, "Making the old man fall and making the old woman stand up."   

**Q:**  Künsangtse's trouble was a small one. After that there was the trouble of Khyungram [Tib. khyung ram] which was much more serious, right?   

**A:**  Yes. Khyungram and Gajang Temba [Tib. mgar byang bstan pa] had a serious problem. What was their secret problem?
 I don't know about that at all. I just heard that Khyungram said [at a meeting], "Not being full even after eating the mountain and not being quenched even after drinking the ocean." [Tib. ri bo zos nas ma 'grangs/ rgya mtso btungs nas ma ngoms][he implied Reting was like that.]   

**Q:**  At that time, Surkhang lost the Treshong [Tib. bkras gshongs] Estate and Reting got it, right?   

**A:**  Yes, Treshong was lost just before that. Later, I heard that the my brother Sawangchemmo was close to Khyungram. But fortunately he was not involved in the letters.   

**Q:** 
 Oh! yes, that was the petition from the Three Monastic Seats.   

**A:**  Khyungram was related to my mother and we were close. My mother used to call him older brother.   

**Q:**  Bönshö was also involved in that, right?   

**A:**  Yes, but they didn't get Bönshö. Bönshö was related very closely to Khyungram. Khyungram was treated very badly. It was terrible! My maternal uncle Khyungram was old and aged, but he was imprisoned and banished. I heard that they whipped my uncle many times and then they made him ride an ox up to Shundongkar [Tib. shun gdong dkar]. At that time, our household sent a clerk with money and a Khata to Khyungram after he passed Shundongkar. We also sent money to him through the clerk.   

**Q:**  I heard that in the beginning, Khyungram was close to Reting. right?   

**A:**  I am not sure about this, but later that comment slipped out. And there might have been something else.   

**Q:**  Probably, there was some kind of grudge, right?   

**A:**  Not really grudge. Probably we was trying to be honest and upright [Tib. gzhung srang po/ gzhung sems] for the government.   

**Q:**  When Phünkang was appointed as Shape, did Khyungram want to become Shape?   

**A:**  I didn't know about that. Gajang Temba was also banished, right?   

**Q:** 
 Did they banish Gajang Temba again? I heard that Gajang Temba made corrections on that letter.   

**Q:**  After that, Reting stayed in power only 5-6 months. How did you hear the news about the resignation of Reting?   

**A:**  I just heard about that all of a sudden on the 29th of 12th month, the time of the Tsegutor [Tib. rtse dgu gtor] or the New Year time when the Regent went to the Potala. Why did he resign? He shouldn't have resigned.   

**Q:**  I don't know about the history. What did you feel at that time?   

**A:**  I didn't feel disappointed or bad, because at the time of Reting we had a hard time when they took away our Treshong Estate. I also didn't feel glad.   

**Q:**  For what reason did Reting Rimpoche resign?   

**A:**  I am also wondering about this.   

**Q:**  At that time, people were talking about different things. Some of them were saying that it was because Reting had lost his celibacy and he might have to ordain the Dalai Lama giving him his the monk's vows, so he was avoiding the ordination[Tib. rab g.yol].   

**A:**  There was the talk about avoiding the ordination, and he was also afraid.   

**Q:**  Probably he had the plan to resign earlier.   

**A:**  Probably.   

**Q:**  He also sent a letter on the samtra message board [Tib. phyag sam] to Kyabje Phabongkha [Tib. skyabs rje pha bong kha] asking him to become the regent.   

**A:**  Phabongkha wouldn't like to become a regent.   

**Q:**  When Taktra became the regent, was he kind of the same as Reting or was he kind of different regarding government matters. Was he better and more reserved [Tib. sgam po]? Or was he kind of not attentive?   

**A:**  Regarding the basic politics, probably it was kind of the same. Taktra didn't make any progress and probably he didn't do according to the thoughts of the former Dalai Lama like setting up new schools and hospitals and giving exemptions on taxes to the miser (serfs). Otherwise, it was kind of generic [rule] [Tib. de 'dra de 'dra red].   

**Q:**  After Taktra took power, Surkhang was the first kalön he appointed. We heard that at that time your father was requesting to be made a kalön. Was that correct?   

**A:**  Probably not. I don't think so. I think there wasn't any talk about my father asking to be a kalön.   

**Q:**  He was also not among the candidates, right?   

**A:**  Yes. [He wasn't]   

**Q:**  Who were the people who were requesting to get the kalön position? There was Kapshöba, Sambo and Ragashag   

**A:**  Probably, Ragashag wasn't asking.   

**Q:**  I heard that the Surkhang household offered a "snack" [Tib. zhal tog] [gold biscuit] to Talungdra, right? It was said widely and people were saying that you went to offer the snack, right?   

**A:**  Not really like that. At that time, that was the way to do things [Tib. 'gro khungs].
